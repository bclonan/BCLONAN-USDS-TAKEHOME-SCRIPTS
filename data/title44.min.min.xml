The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would compromise its ability to complete or continue criminal investigations and to detect or identify violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed system of records would provide individuals with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, and this could enable them to avoid detection or apprehension in the following ways:</P><P>(A) By discovering the collection of facts which would form the basis for their arrest, (B) by enabling them to destroy evidence of criminal conduct which would form the basis for their arrest, and (C) by learning that the criminal investigators had reason to believe that a crime was about to be committed, they could delay the commission of the crime or change the scene of the crime to a location which might not be under surveillance. Granting access to ongoing or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning criminal activity to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing law enforcement officers' established investigative tools and procedures. Further, granting access to investigative files and records could disclose the identity of confidential sources and other informers and the nature of the information which they supplied, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those sources of information by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided information relating to the criminal activities of those individuals who are the subjects of the investigative files and records; confidential sources and other informers might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information if they could not be secure in the knowledge that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure of either their names or the nature of the information they supplied, and this would seriously impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mandate to enforce criminal and related laws. Additionally, providing access to records contained in the above-listed system of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement personnel who compiled information regarding individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those undercover personnel or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.</P><P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4), which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</P><P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of other law enforcement agencies to make effective use of information provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the investigation, detection and apprehension of violators of the criminal laws enforced by those other law enforcement agencies. Making accountings of disclosure available to violators or possible violators would alert those individuals to the fact that another agency is conducting an investigation into their criminal activities, and this could reveal the geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other geographic areas or by destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for their arrest. In addition, providing violators with accountings of disclosure would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has information regarding their criminal activities and could inform those individuals of the general nature of that information; this, in turn, would afford those individuals a better opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid detection or apprehension for violations of criminal and related laws.</P><P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires that an agency inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. Since this provision is dependent on an individual's having been provided an opportunity to contest (seek amendment to) records pertaining to him/her, and since the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt from those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to amendments of records as indicated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that this provision should not be applicable to the above system of records.</P><P>(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires that an agency publish a public notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The categories of sources of this system of records have been published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E></P><P>(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term<I>maintain</I></P><P>(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires that an agency collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct investigations and to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws for the following reasons:</P><P>(A) Most information collected about an individual under criminal investigations is obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers, and it is usually not feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his/her criminal activities, (B) an attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to attempt to conceal his/her criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension, (C) in certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation is not required to supply information to criminal investigators as a matter of legal duty, and (D) during criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound investigative procedures to obtain information from a variety of sources in order to verify information already obtained.</P><P>(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires that an agency inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, either on the form which the agency uses to collect the information or on a separate form which can be retained by the individual, with the following information: The authority which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; the routine uses which may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual of not providing all or part of the requested information. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision in order to avoid adverse effects on its ability to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws. In many cases, information is obtained by confidential sources, other informers or undercover law enforcement officers under circumstances where it is necessary that the true purpose of their actions be kept secret so as to avoid alerting the subject of the investigation or his/her associates that a criminal investigation is in process. Further, if it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in a criminal investigation, that officer's life or physical safety could be endangered through reprisal, and, under such circumstances it may not be possible to continue to utilize that officer in the investigation. In many cases, individuals, for personal reasons, would feel inhibited in talking to a person representing a criminal law enforcement agency but would be willing to talk to a confidential source or undercover officer who they believe is not involved in law enforcement activities. In addition, providing a source of information with written evidence that he was a source, as required by this provision, could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be the subject of retaliatory action by the subject of the investigation. Further, application of this provision could result in an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the subject of the criminal investigation, particularly where further investigation would result in a finding that the subject was not involved in any criminal activity.</P><P>(x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires that an agency maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines “maintain” to include “collect” and “disseminate,” application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would hinder the initial collection of any information which could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, relevant, timely and complete. Similarly, application of this provision would seriously restrict the necessary flow of information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to other law enforcement agencies when a FEMA investigation revealed information pertaining to a violation of law which was under investigative jurisdiction of another agency. In collecting information during the course of a criminal investigation, it is not possible or feasible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to collection of the information; in disseminating information to other law enforcement agencies it is often not possible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to dissemination because the disseminating agency may not have the expertise with which to make such determinations. Further, information which may initially appear to be inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete may, when gathered, grouped, and evaluated with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise of their judgment in reporting on results obtained during criminal investigations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5).</P><P>(xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires that an agency make reasonable effort to serve notice on an individual when any record on the individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempt from this provision in order to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those records and in order to prevent revelation of the existence on an on-going investigation where there is a need to keep the existence of the investigation secret.</P><P>(xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides civil remedies to an individual for an agency's refusal to amend a record or to make a review of a request for amendment; for an agency's refusal to grant access to a record; for an agency's failure to maintain accurate, relevant, timely and complete records which are used to make a determination which is adverse to the individual; and for an agency's failure to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision to the extent that the civil remedies provided therein may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt. Since the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section are proposed to be inapplicable to the above-listed systems of records for the reasons stated therein, there should be no corresponding civil remedies for failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions to which the exemption is proposed to apply. Further, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would adversely affect its ability to conduct criminal investigations by exposing to civil court action every stage of the criminal investigative process in which information is compiled or used in order to identify, detect, or otherwise investigate persons suspected or known to be engaged in criminal conduct.</P><P>(xiii) Individuals may not have access to another agency's records, which are contained in files maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when that other agency's regulations provide that such records are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, FEMA will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[45 FR 64580, Sept. 30, 1980]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 6.87" NODE="44:1.0.1.1.7.7.1.2" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 6.87 Specific exemptions.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).</I></P><EXTRACT><FP-1>Claims (litigation) (FEMA/GC-1)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>FEMA Enforcement (Compliance) (FEMA/GC-2)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-1)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>Security Management Information System (FEMA/SEC-1)—Limited Access</FP-1></EXTRACT><P>(b)<I>Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f).</I></P><P>(1)<I>Exempt systems.</I></P><EXTRACT><FP-1>Claims (litigation) (FEMA/GC-1)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>FEMA Enforcement (Compliance) (FEMA/GC-2)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-1)—Limited Access</FP-1><FP-1>Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints of Discrimination Files (FEMA/PER-2)—Limited Access</FP-1></EXTRACT><P>(2)<I>Reasons for exemptions.</I></P><P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair its ability to complete or continue civil or criminal investigations and inquiries and to detect violators of civil or criminal laws. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed systems of records would provide violators with significant information concerning the nature of the civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. Knowledge of the facts developed during an investigation or inquiry would enable violators of criminal and civil laws and regulations to learn the extent to which the investigation or inquiry has progressed, and this could provide them with an opportunity to destroy evidence that would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. In addition, knowledge gained through access to investigatory material could alert a violator to the need to temporarily postpone commission of the violation or to change the intended point where the violation is to be committed so as to avoid detection or apprehension. Further, access to investigatory material would disclose investigative techniques and procedures which, if known, could enable violators to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing investigators' established and effective investigative tools and procedures. In addition, investigatory material may contain the identity of a confidential source of information or other informer who would not want his/her identity to be disclosed for reasons of personal privacy or for fear of reprisal at the hands of the individual about whom he/she supplied information. In some cases mere disclosure of the information provided by an informer would reveal the identity of the informer either through the process of elimination or by virtue of the nature of the information supplied. If informers cannot be assured that their identities (as sources for information) will remain confidential, they would be very reluctant in the future to provide information pertaining to violations of criminal and civil laws and regulations, and this would seriously compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mission. Further, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) to the above-listed systems of records would make available attorney's work product and other documents which contain evaluations, recommendations, and discussions of on-going civil and criminal legal proceedings; the availability of such documents could have a chilling effect on the free flow of information and ideas within the Federal Emergency Management Agency which is vital to the agency's predecisional deliberative process, could seriously prejudice the agency's or the Government's position in a civil or criminal litigation, and could result in the disclosure of investigatory material which should not be disclosed for the reasons stated above. It is the belief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that, in both civil actions and criminal prosecutions, due process will assure that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to learn of the existence of, and to challenge, investigatory records and related materials which are to be used in legal proceedings.</P><P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph, and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</P><P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and inquiries into civil and criminal violations under their respective jurisdictions. Making accountings available to violators would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another law enforcement authority is conducting an investigation or inquiry into their activities, and such accountings could reveal the geographic location of the investigation or inquiry, the nature and purpose of the investigation or inquiry and the nature of the information disclosed, and the date on which that investigation or inquiry was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, transferring their activities to other locations or destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions.</P><P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order.

While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper.

L. 90-448, August 1, 1968) to provide previously unavailable flood insurance protection to property owners in flood-prone areas. Mudslide (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969). Flood-related erosion (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, December 31, 1973). The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 requires the purchase of flood insurance on and after March 2, 1974, as a condition of receiving any form of Federal or federally-related financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes with respect to insurable buildings and mobile homes within an identified special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard area that is located within any community participating in the Program. The Act also requires that on and after July 1, 1975, or one year after a community has been formally notified by the Federal Insurance Administrator. of its identification as community containing one or more special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard areas, no such Federal financial assistance, shall be provided within such an area unless the community in which the area is located is then participating in the Program, subject to certain exceptions. See FIA published Guidelines at § 59.4(c).</P><P>(b) To qualify for the sale of federally-subsidized flood insurance a community must adopt and submit to the Federal Insurance Administrator as part of its application, flood plain management regulations, satisfying at a minimum the criteria set forth at part 60 of this subchapter, designed to reduce or avoid future flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion damages. These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.</P><P>(c) Minimum requirements for adequate flood plain management regulations are set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, in § 60.4 for mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas and in § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas. Those applicable requirements and standards are based on the amount of technical information available to the community.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[41 FR 46968, Oct. 26, 1976, as amended at 43 FR 7140, Feb. 17, 1978.

Since this requirement resulted in a delay in providing insurance, the Congress, in section 408 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969), established an Emergency Flood Insurance Program as a new section 1336 of the National Flood Insurance Act (42 U.S.C. 4056) to permit the early sale of insurance in flood-prone communities. The emergency program does not affect the requirement that a community must adopt adequate flood plain management regulations pursuant to part 60 of this subchapter but permits insurance to be sold before a study is conducted to determine risk premium rates for the community. The program still requires upon the effective date of a FIRM the charging of risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements and for higher limits of coverage for existing structures.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[43 FR 7140, Feb. 17, 1978.

Probation shall represent formal notification to the community that the Federal Insurance Administrator regards the community's flood plain management program as not compliant with NFIP criteria. Prior to imposing probation, the Federal Insurance Administrator (1) shall inform the community upon 90 days prior written notice of the impending probation and of the specific program deficiencies and violations relative to the failure to enforce, (2) shall, at least 60 days before probation is to begin, issue a press release to local media explaining the reasons for and the effects of probation, and (3) shall, at least 90 days before probation is to begin, advise all policyholders in the community of the impending probation and the additional premium that will be charged, as provided in this paragraph, on policies sold or renewed during the period of probation. During this 90-day period the community shall have the opportunity to avoid probation by demonstrating compliance with Program requirements, or by correcting Program deficiencies and remedying all violations to the maximum extent possible. If, at the end of the 90-day period, the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that the community has failed to do so, the probation shall go into effect. Probation may be continued for up to one year after the community corrects all Program deficiencies and remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible. Flood insurance may be sold or renewed in the community while it is on probation. Where a policy covers property located in a community placed on probation on or after October 1, 1986, but prior to October 1, 1992, an additional premium of $25.00 shall be charged on each such policy newly issued or renewed during the one-year period beginning on the date the community is placed on probation and during any successive one-year periods that begin prior to October 1, 1992. Where a community's probation begins on or after October 1, 1992, the additional premium described in the preceding sentence shall be $50.00, which shall also be charged during any successive one-year periods during which the community remains on probation for any part thereof. This $50.00 additional premium shall further be charged during any successive one-year periods that begin on or after October 1, 1992, where the preceding one-year probation period began prior to October 1, 1992.</P><P>(c) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce its flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 and does not correct its Program deficiencies and remedy all violations to the maximum extent possible in accordance with compliance deadlines established during a period of probation shall be subject to suspension of its Program eligibility. Under such circumstances, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall grant the community 30 days in which to show cause why it should not be suspended. The Federal Insurance Administrator may conduct a hearing, written or oral, before commencing suspensive action. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. In the event of impending suspension, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall issue a press release to the local media explaining the reasons and effects of the suspension. The community's eligibility shall only be reinstated by the Federal Insurance Administrator upon his receipt of a local legislative or executive measure reaffirming the community's formal intent to adequately enforce the flood plain management requirements of this subpart, together with evidence of action taken by the community to correct Program deficiencies and remedy to the maximum extent possible those violations which caused the suspension. In certain cases, the Federal Insurance Administrator, in order to evaluate the community's performance under the terms of its submission, may withhold reinstatement for a period not to exceed one year from the date of his receipt of the satisfactory submission or place the community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.</P><P>(d) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which repeals its flood plain management regulations, allows its regulations to lapse, or amends its regulations so that they no longer meet the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be suspended from the Program. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibly for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. The community eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P><P>(e) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance may withdraw from the Program by submitting to the Federal Insurance Administrator a copy of a legislative action that explicitly states its desire to withdraw from the National Flood Insurance Program. Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final legislative action, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall withdraw the community from the Program and publish its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. A community that has withdrawn from the Program may be reinstated if its submits the application materials specified in § 59.22(a).</P><P>(f) If during a period of ineligibility under paragraphs (a), (d), or (e) of this section, a community has permitted actions to take place that have aggravated existing flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood related erosion hazards, the Federal Insurance Administrator may withhold reinstatement until the community submits evidence that it has taken action to remedy to the maximum extent possible the increased hazards. The Federal Insurance Administrator may also place the reinstated community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.</P><P>(g) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall promptly notify the servicing company and any insurers issuing flood insurance pursuant to an arrangement with the Federal Insurance Administrator of those communities whose eligibility has been suspended or which have withdrawn from the program. Flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed in those communities. Policies sold or renewed within a community during a period of ineligibility are deemed to be voidable by the Federal Insurance Administrator whether or not the parties to sale or renewal had actual notice of the ineligibility.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[41 FR 46968, Oct. 26, 1976.

These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances or codes. Except as otherwise provided in § 60.6, the adequacy of such regulations shall be determined on the basis of the standards set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, § 60.4 for mudslide areas and § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas.</P><P>(c) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as modifying or replacing the general requirement that all eligible communities must take into account flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use.</P><P>(d) The criteria set forth in this subpart are minimum standards for the adoption of flood plain management regulations by flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and flood-related erosion-prone communities. Any community may exceed the minimum criteria under this part by adopting more comprehensive flood plain management regulations utilizing the standards such as contained in subpart C of this part. In some instances, community officials may have access to information or knowledge of conditions that require, particularly for human safety, higher standards than the minimum criteria set forth in subpart A of this part. Therefore, any flood plain management regulations adopted by a State or a community which are more restrictive than the criteria set forth in this part are encouraged and shall take precedence.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[41 FR 46975, Oct. 26, 1976.

The issuance of a variance is for flood plain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The community, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre (as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. The Federal Insurance Administrator may review a community's findings justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management, the Federal Insurance Administrator may take appropriate action under § 59.24(b) of this subchapter. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. Procedures for the granting of variances by a community are as follows:</P><P>(1) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;</P><P>(2) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures of paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section;</P><P>(3) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;</P><P>(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;</P><P>(5) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

However, certain exceptions from the standards contained in this subpart may be permitted where the Federal Insurance Administrator recognizes that, because of extraordinary circumstances, local conditions may render the application of certain standards the cause for severe hardship and gross inequity for a particular community. Consequently, a community proposing the adoption of flood plain management regulations which vary from the standards set forth in § 60.3, § 60.4, or § 60.5, shall explain in writing to the Federal Insurance Administrator the nature and extent of and the reasons for the exception request and shall include sufficient supporting economic, environmental, topographic, hydrologic, and other scientific and technical data, and data with respect to the impact on public safety and the environment.</P><P>(2) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall prepare a Special Environmental Clearance to determine whether the proposal for an exception under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will have significant impact on the human environment. The decision whether an Environmental Impact Statement or other environmental document will be prepared, will be made in accordance with applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy. Ninety or more days may be required for an environmental quality clearance if the proposed exception will have significant impact on the human environment thereby requiring an EIS.</P><P>(c) A community may propose flood plain management measures which adopt standards for floodproofed residential basements below the base flood level in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE which are not subject to tidal flooding. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section the Federal Insurance Administrator may approve the proposal provided that:</P><P>(1) The community has demonstrated that areas of special flood hazard in which basements will be permitted are subject to shallow and low velocity flooding and that there is adequate flood warning time to ensure that all residents are notified of impending floods. For the purposes of this paragraph flood characteristics must include:</P><P>(i) Flood depths that are five feet or less for developable lots that are contiguous to land above the base flood level and three feet or less for other lots;</P><P>(ii) Flood velocities that are five feet per second or less; and</P><P>(iii) Flood warning times that are 12 hours or greater. Flood warning times of two hours or greater may be approved if the community demonstrates that it has a flood warning system and emergency plan in operation that is adequate to ensure safe evacuation of flood plain residents.</P><P>(2) The community has adopted flood plain management measures that require that new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures with basements in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE shall:</P><P>(i) Be designed and built so that any basement area, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities below the floodproofed design level, is watertight with walls that are impermeable to the passage of water without human intervention. Basement walls shall be built with the capacity to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy resulting from flooding to the floodproofed design level, and shall be designed so that minimal damage will occur from floods that exceed that level. The floodproofed design level shall be an elevation one foot above the level of the base flood where the difference between the base flood and the 500-year flood is three feet or less and two feet above the level of the base flood where the difference is greater than three feet.</P><P>(ii) Have the top of the floor of any basement area no lower than five feet below the elevation of the base flood;</P><P>(iii) Have the area surrounding the structure on all sides filled to or above the elevation of the base flood.

Also, as an alternative, in those cases where the application and premium payment are mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application even though the application and full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP after ten (10) calendar days following the date of application.

</HD1><P>A. This policy insures the following types of property only:</P><P>1. A one to four family residential building, not under a condominium form of ownership;</P><P>2. A single-family dwelling unit in a condominium building; and</P><P>3. Personal property in a building.</P><P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P><P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:</P><P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);</P><P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and</P><P>3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.</P><P>D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.</P><P>E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.</P><P>F. Subject to the exception in I.G below, multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if separate policies were issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A—Building Property.</P><P>G. A Dwelling Form policy with building coverage may be issued to a unit owner in a condominium building that is also insured under a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP). However, no more than $250,000 may be paid in combined benefits for a single unit under the Dwelling Form policy and the RCBAP. We will only pay for damage once. Items of damage paid for under an RCBAP cannot also be claimed under the Dwelling Form policy.</P><HD1>II. Definitions

Personal property is also insured for a period of 45 days at another location as set forth in III.C.2.b, Property Removed to Safety.</P><P>3. Personal property in a building that is not fully enclosed must be secured to prevent flotation out of the building. If the personal property does float out during a flood, it will be conclusively presumed that it was not reasonably secured. In that case, there is no coverage for such property.</P><P>4.

The policy will also cover improvements made or acquired solely at your expense in the dwelling or apartment in which you reside, but for not more than 10 percent of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.</P><P>7. If you are the owner of a unit and have insured personal property under Coverage B in this policy, we will also cover your interior walls, floor, and ceiling (not otherwise insured under a flood insurance policy purchased by your condominium association) for not more than 10 percent of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.</P><P>8. Special Limits.

The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.</P><P>(3) Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b and c, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.</P><P>(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD3>3. Condominium Loss Assessments</HD3><P>a. Subject to III.C.3.b below, if this policy insures a condominium unit, we will pay, up to the Coverage A limit of liability, your share of loss assessments charged against you by the condominium association in accordance with the condominium association's articles of association, declarations and your deed. The assessment must be made because of direct physical loss by or from flood during the policy term, to the unit or to the common elements of the NFIP insured condominium building in which this unit is located.</P><P>b. We will not pay any loss assessment:</P><P>(1) Charged against you and the condominium association by any governmental body;</P><P>(2) That results from a deductible under the insurance purchased by the condominium association insuring common elements;</P><P>(3) That results from a loss to personal property, including contents of a condominium building;</P><P>(4) In which the total payment combined under all policies exceeds the maximum amount of coverage available under the Act for a single unit in a condominium building where the unit is insured under both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP; or</P><P>(5) On any item of damage that has already been paid under a RCBAP where a single unit in a condominium building is insured by both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP.</P><P>c. Condominium Loss Assessment coverage does not increase the Coverage A Limit of Liability and is subject to the maximum coverage limits available for a single-family dwelling under the Act, payable between all policies issued and covering the unit, under the Act.</P><HD2>D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance</HD2><HD3>1. General</HD3><P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P><P>a. Non-residential buildings.</P><P>b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6(b) or (c)].</P><HD3>2. Limit of Liability</HD3><P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A—Building Property and Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P><HD3>3. Eligibility</HD3><P>a. A building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P><P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:</P><P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P><P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P><P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.</P><P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or</P><P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.</P><P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P><P>(1) 3.a.1 above.</P><P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.</P><P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “free-board” requirements,<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are eligible for Coverage D.</P><P>d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Coverage D Exclusion 5.g below.</P><P>e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P><HD3>4. Conditions</HD3><P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P><P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>5. Exclusions</HD3><P>Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), we will not pay for:</P><P>a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.</P><P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.</P><P>c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</P><P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P><P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</P><P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and</P><P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.</P><P>f. Any code upgrade requirements,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</P><P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.</P><P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.</P><P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</P><P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</P><P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>6. Other Provisions</HD3><P>a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the 80 percent insurance-to-value requirement for replacement cost coverage as set forth in Art. VII.R (“Loss Settlement”) of this policy.</P><P>b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.</P><HD1>IV. Property Not Insured
</HD1><P>We do not insure any of the following:</P><P>1. Personal property not inside a building.</P><P>2.

Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.</P><P>11. Buildings or units and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.</P><P>12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.</P><P>13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.</P><P>14.

Personal property you own in common with other unit owners comprising the membership of a condominium association.</P><HD1>V. Exclusions
</HD1><P>A. We only pay for direct physical loss by or from flood, which means that we do not pay you for:</P><P>1. Loss of revenue or profits;</P><P>2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;</P><P>3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</P><P>4. Loss from interruption of business or production;</P><P>5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;</P><P>6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance; or</P><P>7. Any other economic loss you suffer.</P><P>B.<I>Flood in Progress.</I></P><P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:</P><P>1. Earthquake;</P><P>2. Landslide;</P><P>3. Land subsidence;</P><P>4. Sinkholes;</P><P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land area; or</P><P>6. Gradual erosion.</P><P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (<I>see</I></P><P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following:</P><P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;</P><P>2. Freezing or thawing;</P><P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;</P><P>4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:</P><P>a. Substantially confined to the dwelling; or</P><P>b. That is within your control, including but not limited to:</P><P>(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;</P><P>(2) Failure, stoppage, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or</P><P>(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;</P><P>5.

Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property;</P><FP>unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;
</FP><P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;</P><P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;</P><P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;</P><P>9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspire to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or</P><P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.</P><P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</P><P>F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.</P><HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1><P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</P><P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.</P><P>C. The deductible does NOT apply to:</P><P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures;</P><P>2. III.C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments; or</P><P>3. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</P><HD1>VII. General Conditions
</HD1><HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause</HD2><P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:</P><P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or</P><P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.</P><HD2>B. Other Insurance</HD2><P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P><P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.</P><P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P><P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P><P>2. If there is other insurance issued under the Act in the name of your condominium association covering the same property insured by this policy, then this policy will be in excess over the other insurance, except where a condominium loss assessment to the unit owner results from a loss sustained by the condominium association that was not reimbursed under a flood insurance policy written in the name of the association under the Act because the building was not, at the time of loss, insured for an amount equal to the lesser of:</P><P>a. 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost; or</P><P>b. The maximum amount of insurance permitted under the Act.</P><P>The combined coverage payment under the other NFIP insurance and this policy cannot exceed the maximum coverage available under the Act, of $250,000 per single unit.</P><HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</HD2><P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:</P><P>a. When this policy insures only personal property; or</P><P>b. When this policy insures a building under construction.</P><HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information</HD2><P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.</P><P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.</P><P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.</P><P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.</P><P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.</P><P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:</P><P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.</P><P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pays the additional premium amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P><P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.</P><P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.</P><P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.</P><P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.</P><P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.</P><P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b.</P><P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.</P><HD2>E. Policy Renewal</HD2><P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P><P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P><P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P><P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P><HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance</HD2><P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</P><HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss</HD2><P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P><P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.</P><P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.</P><P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.</P><P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P><P>a. The date and time of loss;</P><P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P><P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;</P><P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</P><P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;</P><P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;</P><P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;</P><P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and</P><P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.</P><P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</P><P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P><P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P><P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P><P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P><HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss</HD2><P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:</P><P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:</P><P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</P><P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and</P><P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</P><P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</P><P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and</P><P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.</P><P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:</P><P>a. Quantities and costs;</P><P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);</P><P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;</P><P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</P><P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P><P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P><P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P><P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.</P><HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee</HD2><P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.</P><HD2>J. Loss Payment</HD2><P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P><P>a. We reach an agreement with you;</P><P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</P><P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.</P><P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</P><P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;</P><P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</P><P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.</P><HD2>K. Abandonment</HD2><P>You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured under this policy.</P><HD2>L. Salvage</HD2><P>We may permit you to keep damaged property insured under this policy after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P><HD2>M. Appraisal</HD2><P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.</P><P>Each party will:</P><P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P><P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P><HD2>N. Mortgage Clause</HD2><P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P><P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</P><P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P><P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</P><P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P><P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P><P>4. All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P><P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</P><P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P><P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P><HD2>O. Suit Against Us</HD2><P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year after the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P><HD2>P. Subrogation</HD2><P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P><HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flooding</HD2><P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P><P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P><P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P><P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;</P><P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P><P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P><P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:</P><P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P><P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P><P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P><P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P><P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.</P><P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P><P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P><P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P><P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;</P><P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P><P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b above.</P><P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P><P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any in-creased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P><P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P><P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and</P><P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P><HD2>R. Loss Settlement</HD2><HD3>1. Introduction</HD3><P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in paragraphs a-c below.</P><P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in R.2 below, applies to a single-family dwelling provided:</P><P>(1) It is your principal residence; and</P><P>(2) At the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the dwelling is 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss, or is the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.</P><P>b. Special Loss Settlement, described in R.3 below, applies to a single-family dwelling that is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer.</P><P>c. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement applies to a single-family dwelling not subject to replacement cost or special loss settlement, and to the property listed in R.4 below.</P><HD3>2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</HD3><P>The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling described in R.1.a above:</P><P>a. We will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:</P><P>(1) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page;</P><P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged, with materials of like kind and quality and for like use; or</P><P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use.</P><P>b. If the dwelling is rebuilt at a new location, the cost described above is limited to the cost that would have been incurred if the dwelling had been rebuilt at its former location.</P><P>c. When the full cost of repair or replacement is more than $1,000, or more than 5 percent of the whole amount of insurance that applies to the dwelling, we will not be liable for any loss under R.2.a above or R.4.a.2 below unless and until actual repair or replacement is completed.</P><P>d. You may disregard the replacement cost conditions above and make claim under this policy for loss to dwellings on an actual cash value basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to R.2.a, b, and c above, provided you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the date of loss.</P><P>e. If the community in which your dwelling is located has been converted from the Emergency Program to the Regular Program during the current policy term, then we will consider the maximum amount of available NFIP insurance to be the amount that was available at the beginning of the current policy term.</P><HD3>3. Special Loss Settlement</HD3><P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling that:</P><P>(1) is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer, as defined in II.C.6.b and c;</P><P>(2) is at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has an area of at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled; and</P><P>(3) is your principal residence as specified in R.1.a.1 above.</P><P>b. If such a dwelling is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damage condition, we will, at our discretion pay the least of the following amounts:</P><P>(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the dwelling or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or</P><P>(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.</P><P>c. If such a dwelling is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damage condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost conditions in R.2 above.</P><HD3>4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement</HD3><P>The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value (or in the case of R.4.a.2., below, proportional) loss settlement.</P><P>a. A dwelling, at the time of loss, when the amount of insurance on the dwelling is both less than 80 percent of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss and less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP. In that case, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the amount of insurance that applies to that dwelling:</P><P>(1) The actual cash value, as defined in II.C.2, of the damaged part of the dwelling; or</P><P>(2) A proportion of the cost to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling, without deduction for physical depreciation and after application of the deductible.</P><P>This proportion is determined as follows: If 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the amount of insurance that represents 80 percent of its full replacement cost. But if 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is greater than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.</P><P>b. A two-, three-, or four-family dwelling.</P><P>c. A unit that is not used exclusively for single-family dwelling purposes.</P><P>d. Detached garages.</P><P>e. Personal property.</P><P>f. Appliances, carpets, and carpet pads.</P><P>g. Outdoor awnings, outdoor antennas or aerials of any type, and other outdoor equipment.</P><P>h. Any property insured under this policy that is abandoned after a loss and remains as debris anywhere on the described location.</P><P>i. A dwelling that is not your principal residence.</P><HD3>5. Amount of Insurance Required</HD3><P>To determine the amount of insurance required for a dwelling immediately before the loss, we do not include the value of:</P><P>a. Footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor and support all or part of the dwelling;</P><P>b. Those supports listed in R.5.a above, that are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls if there is no basement; and</P><P>c. Excavations and underground flues, pipes, wiring, and drains.</P><P><I>Note:</I></P><HD1>VIII. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1><HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements</HD2><P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:</P><P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;</P><P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or</P><P>c. Made false statements.</P><P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.</P><P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.</P><P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</P><HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud</HD2><P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:</P><P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;</P><P>b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;</P><P>c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;</P><P>d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or</P><P>e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.</P><P>2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.</P><HD2>C. Cancellation of the Policy by You</HD2><P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>D. Cancellation of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.</P><P>2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.</P><P>a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:</P><P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.</P><P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies</P><P>a. Except as allowed under Article I.G, your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.</P><P>b. Except as allowed under Article I.G, if the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.</P><P>c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to VIII.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>4. Cancellation Due to Physical Alteration of Property</P><P>a. If the insured building has been physically altered in such a manner that it is no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage, we will cancel this policy.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>E. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>Your policy will not be renewed if:</P><P>1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;</P><P>2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;</P><P>3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.</P><HD1>IX. Liberalization Clause
</HD1><P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.</P><HD1>X. What Law Governs
</HD1><P>This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,<I>et seq.</I></P><P><I>In Witness Whereof,</I></P><FP>Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration

</HD1><P>A. Coverage Under This Policy</P><P>1. Except as provided in I.A.2, this policy provides coverage for multifamily buildings (residential buildings designed for use by 5 or more families that are not condominium buildings), non-residential buildings, and their contents.</P><P>2. There is no coverage for a residential condominium building in a regular program community, except for personal property coverage for a unit in a condominium building.</P><P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P><P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:</P><P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);</P><P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and</P><P>3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.</P><P>D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.</P><P>E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.</P><P>F. Multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A—Building Property.</P><HD1>II. Definitions

Owned solely by you, or in the case of a condominium, owned solely by the condominium association and used exclusively in the conduct of the business affairs of the condominium association; or</P><P>b. Owned in common by the unit owners of the condominium association.</P><P>2. We also insure such personal property for 45 days while stored at a temporary location, as set forth in III.C.2.b, Property Removed to Safety.</P><P>3. When this policy insures personal property, coverage will be either for household personal property or other than household personal property, while within the insured building, but not both.</P><P>a. If this policy insures household personal property, it will insure household personal property usual to a living quarters, that:</P><P>(1) Belongs to you, or a member of your household, or at your option:</P><P>(a) Your domestic worker;</P><P>(b) Your guest; or</P><P>(2) You may be legally liable for.</P><P>b. If this policy insures other than household personal property, it will insure your:</P><P>(1) Furniture and fixtures;</P><P>(2) Machinery and equipment;</P><P>(3) Stock; and</P><P>(4) Other personal property owned by you and used in your business, subject to IV, Property Not Insured.</P><P>4.

Clothes washers and dryers;</P><P>e. “Cook-out” grills;</P><P>f. Food freezers, other than walk-in, and food in any freezer;</P><P>g. Outdoor equipment and furniture stored inside the insured building;</P><P>h. Ovens and the like; and</P><P>i. Portable microwave ovens and portable dishwashers.</P><P>5. Coverage for items of property below the lowest elevated floor of an elevated post-FIRM building located in Zones A1-A30, AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30, or VE, or in a basement regardless of the zone, is limited to the following items, if installed in their functioning locations and, if necessary for operation, connected to a power source:</P><P>a. Air conditioning units, portable or window type;</P><P>b. Clothes washers and dryers; and</P><P>c. Food freezers, other than walk-in, and food in any freezer.</P><P>6. Special Limits.

Artwork, photographs, collectibles, or memorabilia, including but not limited to, porcelain or other figures, and sports cards.</P><P>b. Rare books or autographed items.</P><P>c. Jewelry, watches, precious and semi-precious stones, or articles of gold, silver, or platinum.</P><P>d. Furs or any article containing fur that represents its principal value.</P><P>7. We will pay only for the functional value of antiques.</P><P>8. If you are a tenant, you may apply up to 10 percent of the Coverage B limit to improvements:</P><P>a. Made a part of the building you occupy; and</P><P>b. You acquired, or made at your expense, even though you cannot legally remove.</P><P>This coverage does not increase the amount of insurance that applies to insured personal property.</P><P>9. If you are a condominium unit owner, you may apply up to 10 percent of the Coverage B limit to cover loss to interior:</P><P>a. walls,</P><P>b. floors, and</P><P>c. ceilings,</P><FP>that are not insured under a policy issued to the condominium association insuring the condominium building.
</FP><P>This coverage does not increase the amount of insurance that applies to insured personal property.</P><P>10. If you are a tenant, personal property must be inside the fully enclosed building.</P><HD2>C. Coverage C—Other Coverages</HD2><HD3>1. Debris Removal</HD3><P>a. We will pay the expense to remove non-owned debris that is on or in insured property and debris of insured property anywhere.</P><P>b. If you or a member of your household perform the removal work, the value of your work will be based on the Federal minimum wage.</P><P>c. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD3>2. Loss Avoidance Measures</HD3><P>a. Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor</P><P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for costs you incur to protect the insured building from a flood or imminent danger of flood, for the following:</P><P>(a) Your reasonable expenses to buy:</P><P>(i) Sandbags, including sand to fill them;</P><P>(ii) Fill for temporary levees;</P><P>(iii) Pumps; and</P><P>(iv) Plastic sheeting and lumber used in connection with these items.</P><P>(b) The value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, that you perform.</P><P>(2) This coverage for Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor only applies if damage to insured property by or from flood is imminent and the threat of flood damage is apparent enough to lead a person of common prudence to anticipate flood damage. One of the following must also occur:</P><P>(a) A general and temporary condition of flooding in the area near the described location must occur, even if the flood does not reach the building; or</P><P>(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.</P><P>This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><P>b. Property Removed to Safety</P><P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.</P><P>(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.</P><P>(3) Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.</P><P>(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD3>3. Pollution Damage</HD3><P>We will pay for damage caused by pollutants to insured property if the discharge, seepage, migration, release, or escape of the pollutants is caused by or results from flood. The most we will pay under this coverage is $10,000. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limits of liability. Any payment under this provision when combined with all other payments for the same loss cannot exceed the replacement cost or actual cash value, as appropriate, of the insured property. This coverage does not include the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.</P><HD2>D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance</HD2><HD3>1. General</HD3><P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P><P>a. Non-residential buildings.</P><P>b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6(b) or (c)].</P><HD3>2. Limits of Liability</HD3><P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. However, the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A (Building Property) and Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do NOT charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P><HD3>3. Eligibility</HD3><P>a. A building insured under Coverage A (Building Property) sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P><P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:</P><P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P><P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P><P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.</P><P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or</P><P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.</P><P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P><P>(1) 3.a.1 above.</P><P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.</P><P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “free-board” requirements,<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</P><P>d. This coverage will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to the exclusion at III.D.5.g.</P><P>e. This coverage will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P><HD3>4. Conditions</HD3><P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P><P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>5. Exclusions</HD3><P>Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), we will not pay for:</P><P>a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.</P><P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.</P><P>c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</P><P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P><P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</P><P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and</P><P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.</P><P>f. Any code upgrade requirements,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</P><P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.</P><P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.</P><P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</P><P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</P><P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>6. Other Provisions</HD3><P>All other conditions and provisions of the policy apply.</P><HD1>IV. Property Not Insured
</HD1><P>We do not insure any of the following property:</P><P>1. Personal property not inside the fully enclosed building.</P><P>2.

Underground structures and equipment, including wells, septic tanks, and septic systems.</P><P>9. Those portions of walks, walkways, decks, driveways, patios, and other surfaces, all whether protected by a roof or not, located outside the perimeter, exterior walls of the insured building.</P><P>10. Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.</P><P>11. Buildings or units and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.</P><P>12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.</P><P>13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.</P><P>14.

Coverage B—Personal Property of this policy.</P><P>17. A residential condominium building located in a Regular Program community.</P><HD1>V. Exclusions
</HD1><P>A. We only pay for “direct physical loss by or from flood,” which means that we do not pay you for:</P><P>1. Loss of revenue or profits;</P><P>2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;</P><P>3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</P><P>4. Loss from interruption of business or production;</P><P>5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;</P><P>6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance; or</P><P>7. Any other economic loss you suffer.</P><P>B.<I>Flood in Progress.</I></P><P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:</P><P>1. Earthquake;</P><P>2. Landslide;</P><P>3. Land subsidence;</P><P>4. Sinkholes;</P><P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or</P><P>6. Gradual erosion.</P><P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (<I>see</I></P><P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:</P><P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;</P><P>2. Freezing or thawing;</P><P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;</P><P>4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:</P><P>a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or</P><P>b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:</P><P>(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;</P><P>(2) Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or</P><P>(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;</P><P>5. Water or water-borne material that:</P><P>a. Backs up through sewers or drains;</P><P>b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or</P><P>c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property;</P><P>unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;</P><P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;</P><P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;</P><P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;</P><P>9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspires to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or</P><P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.</P><P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</P><HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1><P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</P><P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.</P><P>C. The deductible does NOT apply to:</P><P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or</P><P>2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</P><HD1>VII. General Conditions
</HD1><HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause</HD2><P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:</P><P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or</P><P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.</P><HD2>B. Other Insurance</HD2><P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P><P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c below applies.</P><P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P><P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P><P>2. Where this policy insures a condominium association and there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that insures the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.</P><HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</HD2><P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy can constitute a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:</P><P>1. When this policy insures only personal property; or</P><P>2. When this policy insures a building under construction.</P><HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information</HD2><P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.</P><P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1 and VII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.</P><P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.</P><P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.</P><P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.</P><P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:</P><P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.</P><P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P><P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.</P><P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.</P><P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.</P><P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.</P><P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.</P><P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b is provided.</P><P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.</P><HD2>E. Policy Renewal</HD2><P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P><P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P><P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P><P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P><HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance</HD2><P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</P><HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss</HD2><P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P><P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.</P><P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.</P><P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.</P><P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P><P>a. The date and time of loss;</P><P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P><P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;</P><P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</P><P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;</P><P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;</P><P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;</P><P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and</P><P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.</P><P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</P><P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P><P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P><P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P><P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P><HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss</HD2><P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:</P><P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:</P><P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</P><P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and</P><P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</P><P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</P><P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and</P><P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.</P><P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:</P><P>a. Quantities and costs;</P><P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);</P><P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;</P><P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</P><P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P><P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P><P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P><P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.</P><HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee</HD2><P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.</P><HD2>J. Loss Payment</HD2><P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P><P>a. We reach an agreement with you;</P><P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</P><P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.</P><P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</P><P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;</P><P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</P><P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.</P><HD2>K. Abandonment</HD2><P>You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.</P><HD2>L. Salvage</HD2><P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P><HD2>M. Appraisal</HD2><P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss.</P><P>Each party will:</P><P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P><P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P><HD2>N. Mortgage Clause</HD2><P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P><P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</P><P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P><P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</P><P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P><P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P><P>4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P><P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</P><P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P><P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P><HD2>O. Suit Against Us</HD2><P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P><HD2>P. Subrogation</HD2><P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P><HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flood</HD2><P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P><P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P><P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P><P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;</P><P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P><P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P><P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:</P><P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P><P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P><P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P><P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P><P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.</P><P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P><P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P><P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P><P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;</P><P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P><P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b. above.</P><P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P><P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P><P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P><P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and</P><P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P><HD2>R. Loss Settlement</HD2><P>We will pay the least of the following amounts after application of the deductible:</P><P>1. The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;</P><P>2. The actual cash value; or</P><P>3. The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.</P><HD1>VIII. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1><HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements</HD2><P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:</P><P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;</P><P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or</P><P>c. Made false statements.</P><P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.</P><P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.</P><P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</P><HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud</HD2><P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:</P><P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;</P><P>b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;</P><P>c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;</P><P>d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or</P><P>e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.</P><P>2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.</P><HD2>C. Cancellation of the Policy by You</HD2><P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>D. Cancellation of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.</P><P>2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.</P><P>a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:</P><P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.</P><P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies.</P><P>a. Your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.</P><P>b. If the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.</P><P>c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to VIII.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>4. Cancellation Due to Physical Alteration of Property</P><P>a. If the insured building has been physically altered in such a manner that it is no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage, we will cancel this policy.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>E. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>Your policy will not be renewed if:</P><P>1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;</P><P>2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;</P><P>3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.</P><HD1>IX. Liberalization Clause
</HD1><P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.</P><HD1>X. What Law Governs
</HD1><P>This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,<I>et seq.</I></P><P><I>In Witness Whereof,</I></P><FP>Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration

</HD1><HD2>Standard Flood Insurance Policy</HD2><HD3>Residential Condominium Building Association Policy</HD3><P>Please read the policy carefully. The flood insurance provided is subject to limitations, restrictions, and exclusions.</P><HD1>I. Agreement
</HD1><P>A. This policy insures only a residential condominium building in a regular program community. If the community reverts to emergency program status during the policy term and remains as an emergency program community at time of renewal, this policy cannot be renewed.</P><P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P><P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:</P><P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);</P><P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and</P><P>3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.</P><P>D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.</P><P>E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.</P><P>F. Subject to the exception in Section I.G below, multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A—Building Property.</P><P>G. A Dwelling Form policy with building coverage may be issued to a unit owner in a condominium building that is also insured under a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP). However, no more than $250,000 may be paid in combined benefits for a single unit under the Dwelling Form and the RCBAP. We will only pay for damage once. Items of damage paid for under a RCBAP cannot also be claimed under the Dwelling Form policy.</P><HD1>II. Definitions
</HD1><P>A. In this policy, “you” and “your” refer to the named insured(s) shown on the Declarations Page of this policy. The named insured must also include the building owner if building coverage is purchased. Insured(s) includes: Any mortgagee and loss payee named in the Application and Declarations Page, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to have an existing interest at the time of loss, in the order of precedence. “We,” “us,” and “our” refer to the insurer.</P><P>Some definitions are complex because they are provided as they appear in the law or regulations, or result from court cases.</P><P>B.<I>Flood,</I></P><P>1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties (one of which is your property) from:</P><P>a. Overflow of inland or tidal waters;</P><P>b. Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;</P><P>c. Mudflow.</P><P>2.

However, coverage does not apply until the building is walled and roofed if the lowest floor, including the basement floor, of a non-elevated building or the lowest elevated floor of an elevated building is:</P><P>(1) Below the base flood elevation in Zones AH, AE, A1-30, AR, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A1-30, AR/A, AR/AO; or</P><P>(2) Below the base flood elevation adjusted to include the effect of wave action in Zones VE or V1-30.</P><P>The lowest floor level is based on the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the floor in Zones VE or V1-V30 or top of the floor in Zones AH, AE, A1-A30, AR, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A1-A30, AR/A, and AR/AO.</P><P>7. A manufactured home or a travel trailer, as described in the II.C.6. If the manufactured home is in a special flood hazard area, it must be anchored in the following manner at the time of the loss:</P><P>a. By over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors; or</P><P>b.

Owned by the unit owners of the condominium association in common, meaning property in which each unit owner has an undivided ownership interest; or</P><P>b. Owned solely by the condominium association and used exclusively in the conduct of the business affairs of the condominium association.</P><P>2. We also insure such personal property for 45 days while stored at a temporary location, as set forth in III.C.2.b, Property Removed to Safety.</P><P>3. Coverage for personal property includes the following property, subject to B.1. above, which is insured under Coverage B only:</P><P>a. Air conditioning units, portable or window type;</P><P>b.

We will pay the expense to remove non-owned debris that is on or in insured property and debris of insured property anywhere.</P><P>b. If you or a member of your household perform the removal work, the value of your work will be based on the Federal minimum wage.</P><P>c. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD3>2. Loss Avoidance Measures</HD3><HD3>a. Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor</HD3><P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for costs you incur to protect the insured building from a flood or imminent danger of flood, for the following:</P><P>(a) Your reasonable expenses to buy:</P><P>(i) Sandbags, including sand to fill them;</P><P>(ii) Fill for temporary levees;</P><P>(iii) Pumps; and</P><P>(iv) Plastic sheeting and lumber used in connection with these items.</P><P>(b) The value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, that you perform.</P><P>(2) This coverage for Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor only applies if damage to insured property by or from flood is imminent and the threat of flood damage is apparent enough to lead a person of common prudence to anticipate flood damage. One of the following must also occur:</P><P>(a) A general and temporary condition of flooding in the area near the described location must occur, even if the flood does not reach the building; or</P><P>(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.</P><P>This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD3>b. Property Removed to Safety</HD3><P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.</P><P>(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there.</P><P>(3) The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements. Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b and c, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.</P><P>(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P><HD2>D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance</HD2><HD3>1. General</HD3><P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P><P>a. Non-residential buildings.</P><P>b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].</P><HD3>2. Limit of Liability</HD3><P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But, the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A—Building Property and Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P><HD3>3. Eligibility</HD3><P>a. A building insured under Coverage A (Building Property) sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P><P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:</P><P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P><P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P><P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.</P><P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or</P><P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.</P><P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P><P>(1) 3.a.1 above.</P><P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.</P><P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “freeboard” requirements,<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</P><P>d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g below relating to improvements.</P><P>e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P><HD3>4. Conditions</HD3><P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P><P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>5. Exclusions</HD3><P>Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) we will not pay for:</P><P>a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.</P><P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.</P><P>c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</P><P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P><P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</P><P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and</P><P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.</P><P>f. Any code upgrade requirements,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</P><P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.</P><P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.</P><P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</P><P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</P><P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P><HD3>6. Other Provisions</HD3><P>a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the coinsurance requirement for replacement cost coverage under Art. VIII.R. (“Loss Settlement”).</P><P>b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.</P><HD1>IV. Property Not Insured
</HD1><P>We do not insure any of the following:</P><P>1. Personal property not inside a building.</P><P>2. A building, and personal property in it, located entirely in, on, or over water or seaward of mean high tide if it was constructed or substantially improved after September 30, 1982.</P><P>3. Open structures, including a building used as a boathouse or any structure or building into which boats are floated, and personal property located in, on, or over water.</P><P>4. Recreational vehicles other than travel trailers described in the Definitions section (see II.C.6.c) whether affixed to a permanent foundation or on wheels.</P><P>5. Self-propelled vehicles or machines, including their parts and equipment. However, we do cover self-propelled vehicles or machines not licensed for use on public roads that are:</P><P>a. Used mainly to service the described location; or</P><P>b. Designed and used to assist handicapped persons, while the vehicles or machines are inside a building at the described location.</P><P>6. Land, land values, lawns, trees, shrubs, plants, growing crops, or animals.</P><P>7. Accounts, bills, coins, currency, deeds, evidences of debt, medals, money, scrip, stored value cards, postage stamps, securities, bullion, manuscripts, or other valuable papers.</P><P>8. Underground structures and equipment, including wells, septic tanks, and septic systems.</P><P>9. Those portions of walks, walkways, decks, driveways, patios, and other surfaces, all whether protected by a roof or not, located outside the perimeter, exterior walls of the insured building.</P><P>10. Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.</P><P>11. Buildings and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.</P><P>12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.</P><P>13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.</P><P>14. Hot tubs and spas that are not bathroom fixtures, and swimming pools, and their equipment such as, but not limited to, heaters, filters, pumps, and pipes, wherever located.</P><P>15.

Personal property used in connection with any incidental commercial occupancy or use of the building.</P><HD1>V. Exclusions
</HD1><P>A. We only pay for “direct physical loss by or from flood,” which means that we do not pay you for:</P><P>1. Loss of revenue or profits;</P><P>2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;</P><P>3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</P><P>4. Loss from interruption of business or production;</P><P>5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;</P><P>6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance; or</P><P>7. Any other economic loss you suffer.</P><P>B.<I>Flood in Progress.</I></P><P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:</P><P>1. Earthquake;</P><P>2. Landslide;</P><P>3. Land subsidence;</P><P>4. Sinkholes;</P><P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or</P><P>6. Gradual erosion.</P><P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically covered under our definition of flood (<I>see</I></P><P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:</P><P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;</P><P>2. Freezing or thawing;</P><P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;</P><P>4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:</P><P>a.

Water or water-borne material that:</P><P>a. Backs up through sewers or drains;</P><P>b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or</P><P>c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property; unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;</P><P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;</P><P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;</P><P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;</P><P>9. Anything you or your agents do or conspire to do to cause loss by flood deliberately; or</P><P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.</P><P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</P><P>F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.</P><HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1><P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</P><P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.</P><P>C. No deductible applies to:</P><P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or</P><P>2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</P><HD1>VII. Coinsurance
</HD1><P>A. This Coinsurance Section applies only to coverage on the building.</P><P>B. We will impose a penalty on loss payment unless the amount of insurance applicable to the damaged building is:</P><P>1. At least 80 percent of its replacement cost; or</P><P>2. The maximum amount of insurance available for that building under the NFIP, whichever is less.</P><P>C. If the actual amount of insurance on the building is less than the required amount in accordance with the terms of VII.B above, then loss payment is determined as follows (subject to all other relevant conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to valuation, adjustment, settlement, and payment of loss):</P><P>1. Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the building by the required amount of insurance.</P><P>2. Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the deductible, by the figure determined in C.1 above.</P><P>3. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in C.2 above.</P><P>We will pay the amount determined in C.3 above, or the amount of insurance carried, whichever is less. The amount of insurance carried, if in excess of the applicable maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, is reduced accordingly.</P><HD2>Examples</HD2><FP-1>Example #1 (Inadequate Insurance)</FP-1><FP-1>Replacement value of the building—$250,000</FP-1><FP-1>Required amount of insurance—$200,000</FP-1><FP-1>(80 percent of replacement value of $250,000)</FP-1><FP-1>Actual amount of insurance carried—$180,000</FP-1><FP-1>Amount of the loss—$150,000</FP-1><FP-1>Deductible—$500</FP-1><FP-1>Step 1: 180,000/200,000 = .90</FP-1><FP-1>(90 percent of what should be carried.)</FP-1><FP-1>Step 2: 150,000 × .90 = 135,000</FP-1><FP-1>Step 3: 135,000−500 = 134,500</FP-1><P>We will pay no more than $134,500. The remaining $15,500 is not covered due to the coinsurance penalty ($15,000) and application of the deductible ($500).</P><FP-1>Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)</FP-1><FP-1>Replacement value of the building—$500,000</FP-1><FP-1>Required amount of insurance—$400,000</FP-1><FP-1>(80 percent of replacement value of $500,000)</FP-1><FP-1>Actual amount of insurance carried—$400,000</FP-1><FP-1>Amount of the loss—$200,000</FP-1><FP-1>Deductible—$500</FP-1><P>In this example there is no coinsurance penalty, because the actual amount of insurance carried meets the required amount. We will pay no more than $199,500 ($200,000 amount of loss minus the $500 deductible).</P><P>D. In calculating the full replacement cost of a building:</P><P>1. The replacement cost value of any insured building property will be included;</P><P>2. The replacement cost value of any building property not insured under this policy will not be included; and</P><P>3. Only the replacement cost value of improvements installed by the condominium association will be included.</P><HD1>VIII. General Conditions
</HD1><HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause</HD2><P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:</P><P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or</P><P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.</P><HD2>B. Other Insurance</HD2><P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P><P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VIII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.</P><P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P><P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VIII.B.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P><P>2. If there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.</P><HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</HD2><P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:</P><P>1. When this policy insures only personal property; or</P><P>2. When this policy insures a building under construction.</P><HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information</HD2><P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.</P><P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VIII.D.1 and VIII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.</P><P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.</P><P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VIII.E.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.</P><P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.</P><P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VIII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:</P><P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.</P><P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P><P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.</P><P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.</P><P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.</P><P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VIII.D.3.a above.</P><P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.</P><P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amount requested in VIII.D.3.a or VIII.D.4.a, or the additional information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b.</P><P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of IX.A apply.</P><HD2>E. Policy Renewal</HD2><P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P><P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P><P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P><P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P><P>c. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P><HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance</HD2><P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</P><HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss</HD2><P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P><P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.</P><P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.</P><P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.</P><P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P><P>a. The date and time of loss;</P><P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P><P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;</P><P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</P><P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;</P><P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;</P><P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;</P><P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and</P><P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.</P><P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</P><P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P><P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P><P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P><P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P><HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss</HD2><P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:</P><P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:</P><P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</P><P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and</P><P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</P><P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</P><P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, and rules and regulations; and</P><P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.</P><P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:</P><P>a. Quantities and costs;</P><P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);</P><P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;</P><P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</P><P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P><P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P><P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P><P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.</P><HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee</HD2><P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.</P><HD2>J. Loss Payment</HD2><P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P><P>a. We reach an agreement with you;</P><P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</P><P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VIII.M.</P><P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</P><P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;</P><P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</P><P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.</P><HD2>K. Abandonment</HD2><P>You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.</P><HD2>L. Salvage</HD2><P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P><HD2>M. Appraisal</HD2><P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.</P><P>Each party will:</P><P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P><P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P><HD2>N. Mortgage Clause</HD2><P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P><P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</P><P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P><P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</P><P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P><P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P><P>4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P><P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</P><P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P><P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P><HD2>O. Suit Against Us</HD2><P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P><HD2>P. Subrogation</HD2><P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P><HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flood</HD2><P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P><P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P><P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P><P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;</P><P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P><P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P><P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or this paragraph Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:</P><P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P><P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P><P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P><P>(2) Grant the conservation easement contained in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P><P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.</P><P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P><P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P><P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P><P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;</P><P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P><P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above.</P><P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P><P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P><P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P><P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q2.e and Q.2.f above; and</P><P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P><HD2>R. Loss Settlement</HD2><HD3>1. Introduction</HD3><P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in a-c below.</P><P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in R.2 below applies to buildings other than manufactured homes or travel trailers.</P><P>b. Special Loss Settlement, described in R.3 below applies to a residential condominium building that is a travel trailer or a manufactured home.</P><P>c. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement applies to all other property insured under this policy, as outlined in R.4. below.</P><HD3>2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</HD3><P>a. We will pay to repair or replace a damaged or destroyed building, after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:</P><P>(1) The amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the building;</P><P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the building damaged, with materials of like kind and quality, and for like occupancy and use; or</P><P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the building for like occupancy and use.</P><P>b. We will not be liable for any loss on a Replacement Cost Coverage basis unless and until actual repair or replacement of the damaged building or parts thereof, is completed.</P><P>c. If a building is rebuilt at a location other than the described location, we will pay no more than it would have cost to repair or rebuild at the described location, subject to all other terms of Replacement Cost Loss Settlement.</P><HD3>3. Special Loss Settlement</HD3><P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a residential condominium building that is:</P><P>(1) A manufactured home or travel trailer, as defined in II.C.6.b and c; and</P><P>(2) at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled.</P><P>b. If such a building is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damaged condition, we will, at our discretion, pay the least of the following amounts:</P><P>(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the manufactured home or travel trailer or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or</P><P>(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.</P><P>c. If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damaged condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost Loss Settlement conditions in R.2 above.</P><HD3>4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement</HD3><P>a. The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value loss settlement:</P><P>(1) Personal property;</P><P>(2) Insured property abandoned after a loss and that remains as debris at the described location;</P><P>(3) Outside antennas and aerials, awnings, and other outdoor equipment;</P><P>(4) Carpeting and pads;</P><P>(5) Appliances; and</P><P>(6) A manufactured home or mobile home or a travel trailer as defined in II.C.6.b or c that does not meet the conditions for special loss settlement in R.3 above.</P><P>b. We will pay the least of the following amounts:</P><P>(1) The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;</P><P>(2) The actual cash value, as defined in II.C.2; or</P><P>(3) The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.</P><HD1>IX. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1><HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements</HD2><P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:</P><P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;</P><P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or</P><P>c. Made false statements.</P><P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.</P><P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1.above were committed.</P><P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</P><HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud</HD2><P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:</P><P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;</P><P>b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;</P><P>c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;</P><P>d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or</P><P>e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.</P><P>2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.</P><HD2>C. Cancellation of the Policy by You</HD2><P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>D. Cancellation of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on This Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VIII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.</P><P>2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.</P><P>a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:</P><P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.</P><P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies.</P><P>a. Except as allowed under Article I.F, your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.</P><P>b. Except as allowed under Article I.G, if the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.</P><P>c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to IX.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><P>4. Cancellation Due to Physical Alteration of Property.</P><P>a. If the insured building has been physically altered in such a manner that it is no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage, we will cancel this policy.</P><P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P><HD2>E. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</HD2><P>Your policy will not be renewed if:</P><P>1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;</P><P>2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;</P><P>3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.</P><HD1>X. Liberalization Clause
</HD1><P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.</P><HD1>XI. What Law Governs
</HD1><P>This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,<I>et seq.</I></P><P><I>In Witness Whereof,</I></P><FP>Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration

Under these arrangements, such companies or other insurers may offer flood insurance coverage under the program to eligible applicants. Such WYO companies may offer flood coverage to policyholders insured by them under their own property business lines of insurance, pursuant to their customary business practices, including their usual arrangements with agents and producers. WYO companies may sell flood insurance coverage in any State in which the WYO company is authorized to engage in the business of property insurance. Other WYO insurers may offer flood insurance coverage to their pool members insured by them under their own property business lines of coverage, pursuant to their customary business practices. These other WYO insurers may provide flood coverage in any State that has authorized the other insurer to provide property coverage to its members. Arrangements entered into by WYO companies or other insurers under this subpart must be in the form and substance of the standard arrangement, titled “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.” Each year, at least six months before the effective date of the “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement,” FEMA must publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E></P><P>(b) Any duly authorized insurer so engaged in the Program shall be a WYO Company. (The term “WYO Company” shall include the following kinds of insurers: Public entity risk-sharing organizations, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures.)</P><P>(c) A WYO Company is authorized to arrange for the issuance of flood insurance in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified in § 61.6 of this subchapter, as Insurer, to any person qualifying for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits an application to the WYO Company; coverage shall be issued under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P><P>(d) A WYO Company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for the adjustment, settlement, payment and defense of all claims arising from policies of flood insurance it issues under the Program, based upon the terms and conditions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P><P>(e) In carrying out its functions under this subpart, a WYO Company shall use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act and regulations prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administrator under the Act.</P><P>(f) To facilitate the marketing of flood insurance coverage under the Program to policyholders of WYO Companies, the Federal Insurance Administrator will enter into arrangements with such companies whereby the Federal Government will be a guarantor in which the primary relationship between the WYO Company and the Federal Government will be one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately expended. In furtherance of this end, the Federal Insurance Administrator has established “A Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your Own Program.”</P><P>(g) A WYO Company shall act as a fiscal agent of the Federal Government, but not as its general agent. WYO Companies are solely responsible for their obligations to their insured under any flood insurance policies issued under agreements entered into with the Federal Insurance Administrator, such that the Federal Government is not a proper party defendant in any lawsuit arising out of such policies.</P><P>(h) To facilitate the underwriting of flood insurance coverage by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies:</P><P>(1) To expedite business growth, the WYO Company will encourage its present property insurance policyholders to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP WYO Program.</P><P>(2) To conform its underwriting practices to the underwriting rules and rates in effect as to the NFIP, the WYO Company will establish procedures to carry out the NFIP rating system and provide its policyholders with the same coverage as is afforded under the NFIP.</P><P>(3) The WYO Company may follow its customary billing practices to meet the Federal rules on the presentment of premium and net premium deposits to a Letter of Credit bank account authorized by the Federal Insurance Administrator and reduction of coverage when an underpayment is discovered.</P><P>(4) The WYO Company is expected to meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan. Transactions reported by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan will be analyzed by the NFIP Bureau &amp; Statistical Agent. A monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions that have not passed systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's reconciliation reports.</P><P>(5) If a WYO Company rejects an application from an agent or a producer, the agent or producer shall be notified so that the business can be placed through the NFIP Servicing Agent, or another WYO Company.</P><P>(6) Flood insurance coverage will be issued by the WYO Company on a separate policy form and will not be added, by endorsement, to the Company's other property insurance forms.</P><P>(7) Premium payment plans must be offered by the WYO Company under the terms prescribed by the Administrator in § 61.10(a)(1).</P><P>(8) NFIP business will not be assumed by the WYO Companies at any time other than at renewal time, at which time the insurance producer may submit the business to the WYO Company as new business. However, it is permissible to cancel and rewrite flood policies to obtain concurrent expiration dates with other policies covering the property.</P><P>(i) To facilitate the adjustment of flood insurance claims by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies.</P><P>(1) WYO companies will adjust claims in accordance with general company standards, guided by NFIP Claims manuals. The Arrangement provides that claim adjustments shall be binding upon the FIA.</P><P>(2) The WYO Company may use its staff adjusters, independent adjusters, or both. It is important that the Company's Claims Department verifies the correctness of the coverage interpretations and reasonableness of the payments recommended by the adjusters.</P><P>(3) An established loss adjustment Fee Schedule is part of the Arrangement and cannot be changed during an Arrangement year. This is the expense allowance to cover costs of independent or WYO Company adjusters.</P><P>(4) The normal catastrophe claims procedure currently operated by a WYO Company should be implemented in the event of a claim catastrophe situation. Flood claims will be handled along with other catastrophe claims.</P><P>(5) It will be the WYO Company's responsibility to try to detect fraud (as it does in the case of property insurance) and coordinate its findings with FIA.</P><P>(6) Pursuant to the Arrangement, the responsibility for defending claims will be upon the Write Your Own Company and defense costs will be part of the unallocated or allocated claim expense allowance, depending on whether a staff counsel or an outside attorney handles the defense of the matter. Claims in litigation will be reported by WYO Companies to FIA upon joinder of issue and FIA may inquire and be advised of the disposition of such litigation.</P><P>(7) The claim reserving procedures of the individual WYO Company can be used.</P><P>(8) Regarding the handling of subrogation, if a WYO Company prefers to forego pursuit of subrogation recovery, it may do so by referring the matter, with a complete copy of the claim file, to FIA. Subrogation initiatives may be truncated at any time before suit is commenced (after commencing an action, special arrangement must bemade). FIA, after consultation with FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC), will forward the cause of action to OCC or to the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent for prosecution. Any funds received will be deposited, less expenses, in the National Flood Insurance Fund.</P><P>(9) Special allocated loss adjustment expenses will include such items as: nonstaff attorney fees, engineering fees and special investigation fees over and above normal adjustment practices.</P><P>(10) The customary content of claim files will include coverage verification, normal adjuster investigations, including statements where necessary, police reports, building reports and investigations, damage verification and other documentation relevant to the adjustment of claims under the NFIP's and the WYO Company's traditional claim adjustment practices and procedures. The WYO Company's claim examiners and managers will supervise the adjustment of flood insurance claims by staff and independent claims adjusters.</P><P>(11) The WYO Company will extend reasonable cooperation to FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel on matters pertaining to litigation and subrogation, under paragraph (i)(8) of this section.</P><P>(j) To facilitate establishment of financial controls under the WYO Program, the WYO Company will:</P><P>(1) Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial statements conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm at the Company's expense to ensure that the financial data reported to us accurately represents the flood insurance activities of the Company. The CPA firm must conduct its audits in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (commonly known as “yellow book” requirements). The Company must file with us (the Federal Insurance Administration) a report of the CPA firm's detailed biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit report, we will convey our determination to the Standards Committee.</P><P>(2) Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims, underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRPP) Plan (Part 5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the Standards Committee.</P><P>(3) Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual. Transactions reported to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Bureau and Statistical Agent by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual will be analyzed by the Bureau and Statistical Agent and a monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions which do not pass systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on WYO Company reconciliation reports.</P><P>(4) Cooperate with FEMA's Chief Financial Officer on Letter of Credit matters.</P><P>(5) Cooperate with FIA in the implementation of a claims reinspection program.</P><P>(6) Cooperate with FIA in the verification of risk rating information.</P><P>(7) Cooperate with DHS's Office of the Inspector General on matters pertaining to fraud.</P><P>(k) To facilitate the operation of the WYO Program and in order that a WYO Company can use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator, for good cause shown, may grant exceptions to and waivers of the regulations contained in this title relative to the administration of the NFIP.</P><P>(l)(1) WYO Companies may, on a voluntary basis, elect to participate in the Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP), under which they can offer, as a last resort, flood insurance at special high rates, sufficient to recover the full cost of this program in recognition of the uncertainty as to the degree of risk a given building presents due to the limited underwriting data required, to properties in a lending institution's mortgage portfolio to achieve compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Flood insurance policies under the MPPP may only be issued for those properties that:</P><P>(i) Are determined to be located within special flood hazard areas of communities that are participating in the NFIP, and</P><P>(ii) Are not covered by a flood insurance policy even after a required series of notices have been given to the property owner (mortgagor) by the lending institution of the requirement for obtaining and maintaining such coverage, but the mortgagor has failed to respond.</P><P>(2) WYO Companies participating in the MPPP must provide a detailed implementation package to any lending institution that, on a voluntary basis, chooses to participate in the MPPP to ensure the lending institution has full knowledge of the criteria in that program and must obtain a signed receipt for that package from the lending institution. Participating WYO companies must also maintain evidence of compliance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section for review during the audits and reviews required by the WYO Financial Control Plan.</P><P>(3) The mortgagor must be protected against the lending institution's arbitrary placing of flood insurance for which the mortgagor will be billed by being sent three notification letters as described in paragraphs (l)(4) through (6) of this section.</P><P>(4) The initial notification letter must:</P><P>(i) State the requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended;</P><P>(ii) Announce the determination that the mortgagor's property is in an identified special flood hazard area as delineated on the appropriate FEMA map, necessitating flood insurance coverage for the duration of the loan;</P><P>(iii) Describe the procedure to follow should the mortgagor wish to challenge the determination;</P><P>(iv) Request evidence of a valid flood insurance policy or, if there is none, encourage the mortgagor to obtain a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) promptly from a local insurance agent (or WYO Company);</P><P>(v) Advise that the premium for a MPPP policy is significantly higher than a conventional SFIP policy and advise as to the option for obtaining less costly flood insurance; and</P><P>(vi) Advise that a MPPP policy will be purchased by the lender if evidence of flood insurance coverage is not received by a date certain.</P><P>(5) The second notification letter must remind the mortgagor of the previous notice and provide essentially the same information.</P><P>(6) The final notification letter must:</P><P>(i) Enclose a copy of the flood insurance policy purchased under the MPPP on the mortgagor's (insured's) behalf, together with the Declarations Page,</P><P>(ii) Advise that the policy was purchased because of the failure to respond to the previous notices, and</P><P>(iii) Remind the insured that similar coverage may be available at significantly lower cost and advise that the policy can be cancelled at any time during the policy year and a pro rata refund provided for the unearned portion of the premium in the event the insured purchases another policy that is acceptable to satisfy the requirements of the 1973 Act.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[61 FR 51219, Oct. 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 56176, Oct. 18, 1999;

Section 544 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242) amended the Act by adding subsection (c) to section 1306 of the Act. Under this amendment, effective February 5, 1988, section 1306(c) of the Act provides for benefit payments under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) for demolition or relocation of a structure insured under the Act that is located along the shore of a lake or other body of water and that is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. This part establishes criteria by which States can obtain the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator to make these certifications and sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be used by those States in making these certifications. This part also contains provisions regarding other aspects of section 1306(c) of the Act.

Such certification requires that the State collect scientific or technical information relative to the structure and its site and provide such information to the insured to be filed with a claim for insurance benefits under Section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. The information which is provided to the insured shall include, but is not limited to, the following:</P><P>(a) Certification from the State agency that the structure is subject to imminent collapse. The certification shall cite the property address, legal description (e.g., lot, block), the date of application for certification, and the date of and basis for the certification, and</P><P>(b) Supporting scientific and technical data to substantiate the certification consisting of the following:</P><P>(1) Photographs of the structure in relation to the obvious peril. All photographs should be labeled with the location, direction, date and time from which they were taken. The collection of photographs should adequately display the following:</P><P>(i) Any evidence of existing damage. The damage can include loss or erosion of soil near or around the foundation, or structural damage to the foundation components.</P><P>(ii) Structure and waterbody. These photographs shall show both the structure and the waterbody that presents the peril. If the structure is on a high bluff or dune and not accessible from the water side, the top edge of the bluff or dune will be sufficient. These will usually be taken from one or both sides of the structure.</P><P>(iii) Physical reference features used in the measurements discussed below. The reference feature shall be in or near the area affected by normal tides, when applicable. If a reference is not clearly distinguishable on the photograph, it should be annotated to identify the feature. If possible, all reference features described below should be photographed showing their relationship to the site of the threatened structure.</P><P>(2) Identification and selection of reference features. The following reference features are presented according to priority. If the first feature is not present, the next feature shall be located and photographed, and so forth.</P><P>(i) Top edge of bluff (cliff top).</P><P>(ii) Top edge of escarpment on an eroding dune (i.e., a nearly vertical erosional cut at the seaward face of the dune). The normal high tide should be near the toe of the dune and there should be indications that the dune is actively eroding.</P><P>(iii) The normal high tide limit may be indicated by one of the following:</P><P>(A) Vegetation line (the seaward most edge of permanent vegetation).</P><P>(B) Beach scarp (erosion line on beach, usually a sharp, nearly vertical drop of 0.5 to 3.0 feet at the upper limit of high tide).</P><P>(C) Debris line deposited by the normal high tide, not by a recent storm.</P><P>(D) Upper limit of wet sand.</P><P>(3) Distance measurements from the threatened structure to the nearest points on the reference features. These measurements should be taken from all photographed reference features to the closest point on the supporting foundation. For purposes of making this measurement, decks, stairs, and other exterior attachments that do not contribute to the structural support of the building are not considered part of the structure. The measurements shall be taken horizontally with a tape and recorded to the nearest foot. The date and time of the measurement shall be noted. The location of the measurements (i.e., reference feature and closest structural member) shall be identified on the appropriate photograph or sketch of the site. If some or all of the reference features coincide, this shall also be noted and identified on the photographs. Reference features landward of the structure need not be measured, but shall be noted on the photographs.</P><P>(4) A determination of the average annual erosion rate at the site and a copy of the pertinent section of the reference document used to obtain the annual erosion rate at the site.</P><P>(5) Copy of the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panel annotated with the location of the threatened structure.</P><P>(6) In the event that a structure is not situated within a “zone of imminent collapse” using the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, then the State may submit other scientific and technical data, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, that would reveal unusual erosive or stability conditions at the site. Such data must include engineering analyses or reports performed on the structure or site which evaluates local rates of erosion, or the condition or stability of the structure's foundation including supporting soil.</P><P>(c) In the case of structures planned to be relocated, a certification as to whether the proposed relocation site is outside the 30-year setback for 1-4 family residential structures, or outside the 60-year setback for all other structures, must also be submitted by the State.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[53 FR 36975, Sept. 23, 1988, as amended at 53 FR 44193, Nov. 2, 1988]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 63.18" NODE="44:1.0.1.2.28.2.9.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 63.18 Review of State certification by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</HEAD><P>The Federal Insurance Administrator, after a claim has been filed by the property owner, will review the certification and data prepared by the State.

Finally, the applicant's narrative should detail the benefits the department or community will realize as a result of the grant award.</P><P>(c) This second level of review will be conducted using a panel of technical evaluation panelists. These panelists are largely made up of non-Federal experts with a fire service background. The panelists will assess the application's merits with respect to the clarity and detail provided in the narrative about the project, the applicant's financial need, and the project's purported benefit to be derived from the cost. Technical evaluation panelists will independently score each application before them and then discuss the merits/shortcomings of the application in an effort to reconcile any major discrepancies. A consensus on the score is not required. The highest scoring applications resulting from this second level of review will then be considered for award. We seek to maximize the benefits derived from the funding by crediting applicants with the greatest financial need and whose proposed activities provide the greatest benefit versus the cost.</P><P>(d) In addition to the project narrative, the applicant must provide an itemized budget detailing the use of the grant funds. If an applicant is seeking funds in more than one eligible activity within a program, separate budgets will have to be generated for each activity and then an overall or summary budget will have to be generated. For those applicants applying on line, the summary budget will be automatically generated by the e-grants system.</P><P>(e) Specific rating criteria for each of the eligible programs will be published in a Notice of Funding Availability that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 152.6" NODE="44:1.0.1.3.48.0.10.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 152.6 Application review and award process.</HEAD><P>(a) As stated in § 152.5, we will evaluate each application in the preliminary screening process to determine which applications best address the program's established priorities.

The performance period of each grant will be detailed in the Articles of Agreement that we provide each grantee. Grantees may request funds from FEMA as reimbursement for expenditures made under the grant program or they may request funds for immediate cash needs under 2 CFR 200.305. Advances of funds may also be approved to meet immediate cash needs.</P><P>(b) Generally, fire departments cannot use grant funds to pay for products and services contracted for, or purchased prior to the effective date of the grant. However, we will consider requests for reimbursement for these on an exception basis. Expenses incurred after the application deadline but prior to award may be eligible for reimbursement if the expenses were justified, unavoidable (i.e., urgent and compelling), consistent with the scope of work, and specifically approved by the Assistance Officer. Expenses, obligations, commitments or contracts incurred or entered into prior to the application deadline are not eligible to be included as an expense.</P><P>(c) All grantees must follow their own established procurement process when buying anything with Federal grant funds as provided in 2 CFR 200.317-200.326. If the grantee does not have an established procurement process, they must seek a minimum of two bids for any acquisition.</P><P>(d) When requesting funding, grantees can only request an amount that is necessary to satisfy their immediate cash needs directly related to the grant, i.e., an amount equal to the total eligible grant expenses due within 30 days. Grantees can request payments of up to one hundred (100) percent of the federal share of the award amount but only if delivery of the ordered products and/or services is imminent (approximately 30 days) and the resulting payment will require the entire amount of funds.</P><P>(e) A grantee may request sufficient funding for a down payment if required to do so by the seller, such as in grants involving some purchases of firefighting vehicles. The grantee may request as much as fifty (50) percent of the federal share of the award amount at the time of the order placement to pay the down payment. The grantee may request the balance of the federal share upon delivery of the ordered equipment or vehicle.</P><P>(f) The recipients of funding under this program must report to us on how the grant funding was used and the benefits that resulted. This will be accomplished via submission of performance reports. Details regarding the reporting requirements will be provided in the Articles of Agreement provided to each grantee.</P><P>(g) Fire departments that receive funding under this program must agree to provide information to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the assistance. If a grantee does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month period commencing as soon as possible after they develop the capacity to report.

The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, provided that a written request for an extension is submitted by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during this 30-day period. The extension request will stipulate reasons for the delay.</P><P>(b) The basis for the request shall be a finding that:</P><P>(1) The situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments; and</P><P>(2) Federal assistance under the Act is necessary to supplement the efforts and available resources of the State, local governments, disaster relief organizations, and compensation by insurance for disaster-related losses.</P><P>(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:</P><P>(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;</P><P>(2) An estimate of the amount and severity of damages and losses stating the impact of the disaster on the public and private sector;</P><P>(3) Information describing the nature and amount of State and local resources which have been or will be committed to alleviate the results of the disaster;</P><P>(4) Preliminary estimates of the types and amount of supplementary Federal disaster assistance needed under the Stafford Act; and</P><P>(5) Certification by the Governor that State and local government obligations and expenditures for the current disaster will comply with all applicable cost sharing requirements of the Stafford Act.</P><P>(d) For those catastrophes of unusual severity and magnitude when field damage assessments are not necessary to determine the requirement for supplemental Federal assistance, the Governor or Acting Governor may send an abbreviated written request through the Regional Administrator for a declaration of a major disaster. This may be transmitted in the most expeditious manner available. In the event the FEMA Regional Office is severely impacted by the catastrophe, the request may be addressed to the Administrator of FEMA. The request must indicate a finding in accordance with § 206.36(b), and must include as a minimum the information requested by § 206.36 (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5). Upon receipt of the request, FEMA shall expedite the processing of reports and recommendations to the President. Notification to the Governor of the Presidential declaration shall be in accordance with 44 CFR 206.39. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorateshall assure that documentation of the declaration is later assembled to comply fully with these regulations.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 206.37" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.2.10.7" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 206.37 Processing requests for declarations of a major disaster or emergency.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Acknowledgment.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Regional summary.</I></P><P>(c)<I>FEMA recommendation.</I></P><P>(1)<I>Major disaster recommendation.</I></P><P>(2)<I>Emergency recommendation.</I></P><P>(d)<I>Modified Federal emergency recommendation.</I></P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 206.38" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.2.10.8" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 206.38 Presidential determination.</HEAD><P>(a) The Governor's request for a major disaster declaration may result in either a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, or denial of the Governor's request.</P><P>(b) The Governor's request for an emergency declaration may result only in a Presidential declaration of an emergency, or denial of the Governor's request.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[55 FR 2292, Jan. 23, 1990; 55 FR 5458, Feb. 15, 1990]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 206.39" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.2.10.9" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 206.39 Notification.</HEAD><P>(a) The Governor will be promptly notified by the Administrator or his/her designee of a declaration by the President that an emergency or a major disaster exists.

The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each applicant.

Those applicants who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the applicants find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the data-tracking system.</P><P>(10)<I>Miscellaneous.</I></P><CITA TYPE="N">[89 FR 4123, Jan. 22, 2024]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 206.120" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.4.10.12" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 206.120 State administration of other needs assistance.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>State administration of other needs assistance.</I></P><P>(b)<I>State administrative options.</I></P><P>(c)<I>State Administrative Plan (SAP).</I></P><P>(1)<I>Timeframe for submission of SAP.</I></P><P>(2)<I>Renewals.</I></P><P>(3)<I>Amendments.</I></P><P>(i)<I>During non-disaster periods.</I></P><P>(ii)<I>During Presidentially-declared disasters.</I></P><P>(d)<I>State administrative plan requirements.</I></P><P>(1) Assignment of grant program responsibilities to State officials or agencies.</P><P>(2) Staffing Schedule that identifies the position, salary and percent of time for each staff person assigned to program administration and/or implementation.</P><P>(3) Procedures for interaction with applicants:</P><P>(i) Procedures for notifying potential applicants of the availability of the program, to include the publication of application deadlines, pertinent program descriptions, and further program information on the requirements which must be met by the applicant in order to receive assistance;</P><P>(ii) Procedures for registration and acceptance of applications, including late applications, up to the prescribed time limitations as described in § 206.112;</P><P>(iii) Procedures for damage inspection and/or other verifications.</P><P>(iv) Eligibility determinations.</P><P>(A)<I>Under a cooperative agreement:</I></P><P>(B)<I>Under a grant:</I></P><P>(v) Procedures for checking compliance for mandated flood insurance in accordance with § 206.110(k);</P><P>(vi) Procedures for notifying applicants of the State's eligibility decision;</P><P>(vii) Procedures for disbursement of funds to applicants;</P><P>(viii) Procedures for applicant appeal processing.

A delivery sequence establishes the order in which disaster relief agencies and organizations provide assistance. The specific sequence, in accordance with the mandates of the assistance programs, is to be generally followed in the delivery of assistance.</P><P>(ii) When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting agency is responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery sequence pertains to that period of time in the recovery phase when most of the traditional disaster assistance programs are available.</P><P>(2) The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery:</P><P>(i) Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable items such as clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance (including flood insurance);</P><P>(ii) Housing assistance pursuant to the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174;</P><P>(iii) Other Needs assistance, pursuant to the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174;</P><P>(iv) Small Business Administration and Department of Agriculture disaster loans;</P><P>(v) Volunteer agencies' “additional assistance” programs; and</P><P>(vi) The “Cora Brown Fund.”</P><P>(3) Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that:</P><P>(i) Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible for delivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program later in the sequence; and</P><P>(ii) The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can duplicate other assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate insurance benefits, however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the Federal assistance). An agency's position in the sequence determines the order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources it must consider before it does so.</P><P>(4) If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely affect the timely receipt of essential assistance by an individual or household, an agency may offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of another agency. There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B) delivers assistance which is normally the primary responsibility of another agency (Agency A) because Agency A has, for good cause, denied assistance. After the assistance is delivered, Agency A reopens the case. If the primary response Agency A then provides assistance, that Agency A is responsible for coordinating with Agency B to either:</P><P>(i) Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or</P><P>(ii) In the case where the individual or household has refused assistance from Agency A, Agency A must notify Agency B that it must recover assistance previously provided.</P><P>(e)<I>Program guidance</I><I>Programs under the Act vs. other agency assistance.</I></P><P>(ii) If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by the agency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing assistance under the Act. If it is determined that assistance from the agency with primary responsibility will be delayed, assistance under the Act may be provided, but then must be recovered from the applicant when the other assistance becomes available.</P><P>(2)<I>Programs under the Act vs. insurance.</I></P><P>(i) Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an adequate settlement. The applicant must provide information concerning insurance recoveries.</P><P>(ii) Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be sufficient to cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and</P><P>(iii) Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood insurance) will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is involved, FEMA must coordinate with the Federal Insurance Administration. The purpose of this coordination is to obtain information about flood insurance coverage and settlements.</P><P>(3)<I>Random sample.</I></P><P>(4)<I>Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved.</I></P><P>(i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successful in correcting the duplication, FEMA will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication, and FEMA is satisfied that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further action will be taken.</P><P>(ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefits procedures, or FEMA is not satisfied that the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then FEMA must provide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action, FEMA must notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the debt, then as appropriate, take those recovery actions in conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the random sample (or larger universe, at FEMA's discretion).</P><P>(5)<I>Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved.</I></P><P>(f)<I>Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection.</I></P><P>(g)<I>Severability.</I></P><CITA TYPE="N">[54 FR 11615, Mar. 21, 1989, as amended at 67 FR 61460, Sept. 30, 2002; 74 FR 15350, Apr. 3, 2009; 89 FR 4124, Jan. 22, 2024]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§§ 206.192-206.199" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.6.10.14" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§§ 206.192-206.199 [Reserved]</HEAD></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="G" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.7" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart G—Public Assistance Project Administration</HEAD><SOURCE><HED>Source:</HED><PSPACE>55 FR 2304, Jan. 23, 1990, unless otherwise noted.</PSPACE></SOURCE><DIV8 N="§ 206.200" NODE="44:1.0.1.4.55.7.10.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 206.200 General.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Purpose.</I></P><P>(b)<I>What policies apply to FEMA public assistance grants?</I></P><P>(2) The regulations entitled “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,” published at 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002, place requirements on the State in its role as recipient and gives the recipient discretion to administer federal programs under their own procedures.

Subpart A provides an overview of the CGFAA process. Subpart B describes the procedures for bringing a claim. Subpart C explains what compensation is available. Subpart D discusses the claims evaluation process. Subpart E explains the dispute resolution process. Subpart F contains a glossary in which various terms used in the rule are defined.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.5" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.1.10.5" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.5 Overview of the claims process.</HEAD><P>(a) The CGFAA is intended to provide persons who suffered losses from the Cerro Grande Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek redress from the United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. In order to obtain benefits under this legislation, a person must submit all Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States to FEMA. A person who elects to proceed under the CGFAA is barred from bringing a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or filing a civil action against the United States for damages resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire. Judicial review of our decisions under the CGFAA is available.</P><P>(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with OCGFC. OCGFC will provide the Claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and the claim number.</P><P>(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the Claimant to review the claim. The Claims Reviewer will help the Claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the Claimant of his or her responsibility for establishing all elements of the Loss and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Cerro Grande Fire caused the Loss. After the Claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the Claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.</P><P>(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the Claimant. The Claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's Determination. If the Claimant is satisfied with the decision payment will be made after the Claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's Determination an Administrative Appeal may be filed with the Director of OCGFC. If the Claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.6" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.1.10.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.6 Partial payments.</HEAD><P>OCGFC, on its own initiative, or in response to a request by a Claimant, may make one or more partial payments on the claim. A partial payment can be made if OCGFC has a reasonable basis to estimate the Claimant's damages. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a Claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's Determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the CGFAA. Partial payment decisions cannot be appealed.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.7" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.1.10.7" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.7 Authority to settle or compromise claims.</HEAD><P>Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, the Director of OCGFC may extend an offer to settle or compromise a claim or any portion of a claim, which if accepted by the Claimant will be binding on the Claimant and on the United States, except that the United States may recover funds improperly paid to a Claimant due to fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the Claimant or the Claimant's representative, a material mistake on our part or the Claimant's failure to cooperate in an audit as required by § 295.35.</P></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="B" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.2" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart B—Bringing a Claim Under the CGFAA</HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 295.10" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.2.10.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.10 Bringing a claim under the CGFAA.</HEAD><P>(a) Any Injured Person may bring a claim under the CGFAA by filing a Notice of Loss.

If one is signing a Notice of Loss as the legal representative of a Claimant, the signer must disclose his or her relationship to the Claimant. FEMA may require a legal representative to submit evidence of authority.</P><P>(d) Notice of Loss forms are available from OCGFC by request.

The withdrawal of a Federal Tort Claims Act claim must be in the form of a signed, written statement on a form provided by OCGFC that is filed with OCGFC not later than October 27, 2000.

An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Party who received payment from the insurer or third party filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss may not be filed until the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Cerro Grande Fire related losses under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee and the Injured Person. By filing a Subrogation Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the insurer or third party elects the CGFAA as its exclusive remedy against the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Cerro Grande Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Subrogation Notice of Loss form furnished by OCGFC. FEMA will evaluate subrogation claims on their merits. FEMA may reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for reasonable payments made to an Injured Party on or before October 25, 2000, which exceeded or were not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation. FEMA will not reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for payments made to an Injured Party after October 25, 2000 that exceeded or are not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.14" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.2.10.5" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.14 Assignments.</HEAD><P>Assignment of claims and the right to receive compensation for claims under the CGFAA is prohibited and will not be recognized by FEMA.</P></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="C" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.3" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart C—Compensation Available Under the CGFAA</HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 295.20" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.3.10.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.20 Prerequisite to compensation.</HEAD><P>In order to receive compensation under the CGFAA a Claimant must be an Injured Person who suffered a Loss as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire and sustained damages.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.21" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.3.10.2" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.21 Allowable compensation.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Allowable compensation.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Exclusions.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Damages arising in the future.</I></P><P>(d)<I>Destruction of home</I><I>Home and contents.</I><I>Trees and landscaping.</I></P><P>(3)<I>Mitigation.</I></P><P>(e)<I>Reduction in the value of real property.</I></P><P>(1) The Claimant sells the real property in a good faith arm's length transaction that is closed no later than August 28, 2002 and realizes a loss in the pre-fire value; or</P><P>(2) The Claimant can establish that the value of the real property was permanently diminished as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire.</P><P>(f)<I>Destruction of unique items of personal property.</I></P><P>(g)<I>Disaster recovery loans.</I></P><P>(h)<I>Mitigation.</I></P><P>(i)<I>Subsistence</I><I>Allowable damages.</I></P><P>(2)<I>Proof of subsistence use.</I></P><P>(3)<I>Duration of damages.</I></P><P>(j)<I>Flood insurance.</I></P><P>(k)<I>Out of pocket expenses for treatment of mental health conditions.</I></P><P>(l)<I>Donations.</I></P><P>(m)<I>Duplication of benefits.</I></P><P>(1)<I>Insurance.</I></P><P>(2)<I>Coordination with our Public Assistance Program.</I></P><P>(i) Emergency costs that are eligible for reimbursement under the Public Assistance Program; or</P><P>(ii) Losses that are eligible for repair, restoration or replacement under the Public Assistance Program; or</P><P>(iii) Costs or charges determined excessive under the Public Assistance Program.</P><P>(3)<I>Benefits provided by non-governmental organizations and individuals.</I></P><P>(4)<I>Benefits provided by our Individual Assistance program.</I></P><P>(5)<I>Worker's compensation claims.</I></P></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="D" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.4" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart D—Claims Evaluation</HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 295.30" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.4.10.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.30 Establishing losses and damages.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Burden of proof.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Proof of Loss.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Release and Certification Form.</I></P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 295.31" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.60.4.10.2" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 295.31 Reimbursement of claim expenses.</HEAD><P>(a) FEMA will reimburse Claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in copying documentation requested by OCGFC.

This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. To obtain compensation under the Act, an Injured Person must submit all Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related claims against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States to the FEMA Claims Office. An Injured Person who elects to accept an award under the Act is barred from accepting an award pursuant to a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or a civil action against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States arising out of or relating to the same subject matter. Judicial review of FEMA decisions under the Act is available.</P><P>(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with the Claims Office. The Claims Office will provide the claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and a claim number.</P><P>(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the claimant to review the claim. Claims Reviewer will help the claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the claimant of their responsibility for establishing all elements of the injuries and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire caused the injuries. After the claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.</P><P>(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the claimant. The claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's determination. If the claimant is satisfied with the decision, payment will be made after the claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's determination, an administrative appeal may be filed with the Director of the Claims Office. If the claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§§ 296.6-296.9" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.61.1.10.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§§ 296.6-296.9 [Reserved]</HEAD></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="B" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.61.2" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart B—Bringing a Claim Under the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act</HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 296.10" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.61.2.10.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 296.10 Filing a claim under the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act.</HEAD><P>(a) Any Injured Person may bring a claim under the Act by filing a Notice of Loss.

The allocation made to each State represents the total amount of funds available to pay the Federal share of necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative expenses of the State and its participating subdivisions during the fiscal year.</P><P>(b) The first calculation for developing the allocation for each State will be a formula distribution in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act, made by applying the following percentages to the total sum of Emergency Management Assistance in the President's budget request to Congress:</P><P>(1) Fifty (50) percent will be allocated on the basis of the prior-year State allocations, in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to give due regard to “the relative state of development of civil defense readiness of the State” (State and local levels).</P><P>(2) Thirty-three (33) percent will be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the State's population to the national population (50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), in fulfilment of the statutory requirements to give due regard to “population” and to “the criticality of target and support areas and the areas which may be affected by natural disasters with respect to the development of the total civil defense readiness of the Nation.”</P><P>(3) Fifteen (15) percent will be divided equally among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</P><P>(4) In consonance with the statutory provision allowing the Administrator to prescribe other factors concerning the State allocations, the remaining two (2) percent will be held temporarily in reserve, to be used first to fund the four territories of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Conditions peculiar to those areas make strict application of the mathematical formula in § 302.5(b) inequitable. Therefore, the Administrator will consider prior-year allocations, percentage of total United States population, and the factors set out in § 302.5(e) (1), (2), (4), and (5) in determining their allocations. The remaining balance of the reserve fund will then be used to restore any State which would receive less by formula share than its formula share for the previous fiscal year, provided that the reserve balance is sufficient to do this for all such States. Any remaining balance after this has been done will constitute a supplemental fund from which the Administrator will consider State requests for additional funding and the needs of any interstate civil defense authorities.</P><P>(c) For initial planning purposes only, each State will then be informed of the figure by the Regional Administrator. The State will base its initial EMA application upon that figure but may request a smaller amount or with appropriate justification a larger amount.</P><P>(d) The amount requested by the State shall not exceed 50 percent of its estimate of necessary and essential State and local personnel and administrative expenses for the fiscal year.</P><P>(e) The formula distribution shall be reviewed and evaluated, and adjusted as appropriate, by the Administrator, based on the current situation in each State, the requests of all States, and recommendations by the Regional Administrators. The Administrator will consider the following five factors:</P><P>(1) The ability of the State and its subgrantees to effectively expend such an amount for necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative purposes. Past performance is a factor in this determination.</P><P>(2) Special circumstances existing in the State at the time of allocating which require unusual expenditures for civil defense.</P><P>(3) Conditions peculiar to the State which make strict application of mathematical formula inequitable either to that State or other States.</P><P>(4) The relative cost of civil defense personnel and administrative services in that State; that is, whether such costs are considerably above or below the national average for similar services and expenses.</P><P>(5) Substantial changes in the civil defense readiness of the State not reflected by its recent civil defense expenditures.</P><P>(f) In September of each year, based on applications received and recommendations by the Regional Administrators, the Administrator will make a tentative allocation to the States. This will include adjustments for States that have indicated they will not be using the total of the formula distribution amount. States can then revise their earlier plans and applications to more nearly reflect the level of funding expected to become available.</P><P>(g) A State may provide to the Regional Administrator a preliminary annual submission in an amount not to exceed its tentative allocation.</P><P>(h) By September 30 (or as soon thereafter as feasible), the Administrator will make a formal allocation based on, or subject to, appropriation by Congress and allotment of the funds. This allocation for each State may include any additional amounts from the reserve portion of the EMA funds, and shall be in accordance with the regulations in this part and CPG 1-3.</P><P>(i) Upon the appropriation becoming available, and if requested by a State, the Regional Administrator may approve such State's preliminary annual submission (if found to meet all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3) in an appropriate amount which does not exceed the amount of the State's share of the Administrator's formal allocation of the Federal appropriation. An award document obligating Federal funds on the basis of the approved preliminary annual submission may be executed in accordance with the provisions of CPG 1-3.</P><P>(j) Based on and within 60 days after notification of its formal allocation, each State must provide to the Regional Administrator a final annual submission which meets all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3. If no changes are necessary, a State and the Regional Administrator may adopt in writing the State's preliminary annual submission as its final annual submission. If no award document was executed based on a State's preliminary annual submission, such document will be executed on the basis of that State's approved final annual submission.</P><P>(k) With regard to any State whose award document was executed pursuant to a preliminary annual submission covering only part of its formal allocation, upon approval (by the Regional Administrator) of the final annual submission (including a revised statement of work supporting the additional funding request) the Regional Administrator shall execute an amended award document obligating the balance of such State's formal allocation.</P><P>(l) After being advised of its annual formal allocation, if a State fails to submit, within 60 days, an approvable annual submission in the amount of its allocation, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the unused portion to other States in the region in such amounts as in his/her judgment will best assure adequate development of the civil defense capability of the Nation. The exception to this authority is in the event a State, or local jurisdiction, refuses to participate in attack preparedness activities. EMA funds withheld or returned for that reason are to be released to headquarters for reallocation on a national basis. In addition, the Regional Administrator may from time to time reallocate the amounts released by a State from its allocation as no longer being required for utilization in accordance with an approved annual submission and award document.</P><P>(m) Immediate notice to the headquarters EMA Program Manager of State reallocations is required in the form of copies of EMA-approved Annual Submission amendment documents, accompanied by copies of assistance award/amendment documents signed by regional and State authorized officials of both the releasing and recipient States.</P><P>(n) There is no dollar ceiling on the amount of funds that may be reallocated among States in a region. However, at any time that there are funds surplus to the eligible needs of the States within a region, those funds should be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation to other States with unfunded additional requirements.</P><P>(o) On July 1 of each fiscal year, the authority to reallocate EMA funds shall revert to the Administrator. In addition, any excess EMA funds available on that date, or that become available during the remainder of the fiscal year, are to be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation by the Administrator.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[48 FR 44211 Sept. 28, 1983, as amended at 51 FR 12521, Apr. 11, 1986; 51 FR 43924, Dec. 5, 1986; 56 FR 29905, July 1, 1991]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 302.6" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.65.0.10.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 302.6 Fiscal year limitation.</HEAD><P>Federal appropriations for the program covered by the regulations in this part are limited for obligation on a Federal fiscal year basis.

The list identifies items to which major attention should be given in all phases of preattack planning to insure the availability of basic essentials for a productive economy in the event of a nuclear attack. Supply-requirements studies and assessments for these items will be made to disclose critical deficiencies or other problems that can be anticipated. Revisions will be made as necessary to keep the items as up-to-date as possible.</P><P>The items are arranged by seven major groups:</P><P>(1) Health Supplies and Equipment,</P><P>(2) Food,</P><P>(3) Body Protection and Household Operations,</P><P>(4) Electric Power and Fuels,</P><P>(5) Sanitation and Water Supply,</P><P>(6) Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment, and</P><P>(7) General Use Items.</P><P>Survival items are defined as “those items without which large segments of the population would die or have their health so seriously impaired as to render them both burdensome and non-productive.” The items have been classified into Group A or Group B, with Group A representing end products consumed or used directly by the population, and Group B consisting of those items essential to the effective production and utilization of the Group A items, which are consumed or used directly by the people.</P><P>There are no Group B items in the categories of Health Supplies and Equipment, Body Production and Household Operations, and Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment. All of these items are considered to be consumed directly and any attempt to separate them in to A and B groupings would be too arbitrary to be meaningful.</P><P>It is important to keep in mind the fact that while the items listed are the basic essentials necessary for maintaining a viable economy during the first six months following an attack, not all of them would create problems that would require government action preattack to insure adequate supplies. The aforementioned supply-requirements studies will be undertaken to identify the problem areas. In developing supply data, all available production capacity, existing inventories, and possible substitutions will be considered. For example, in analyzing clothing items, all available supplies would be considered from sport to dress shirts, from overalls to dress suits. However, new production would be limited to the simplest form of the basic item which can be produced.

A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 331.2" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.79.0.10.2" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 331.2 Policy.</HEAD><P>(a) It is the policy of the Federal Government to award appropriate contracts to eligible labor surplus area concerns, to place production facilities in labor surplus areas, and to make the best use of our natural, industrial and labor resources in order to achieve the following objectives:</P><P>(1) To preserve management and employee skills necessary to the fulfillment of Government contracts and purchases;</P><P>(2) To maintain productive facilities;</P><P>(3) To improve utilization of the Nation's total economic potential by making use of the labor force resources of each area; and</P><P>(4) To help ensure timely delivery of required goods and services and to promote readiness for mobilization by locating procurement where the needed labor force and facilities are fully available.</P><P>(b) This policy is consonant with the intent of Public Law 95-89 and Public Law 95-507 as implemented by E.O. 12073.

Accordingly, each Federal department and agency shall prepare its national security emergency preparedness plans and programs to respond adequately and in a timely manner to all national security emergencies.</P><P>(b) As part of emergency response, the GMR system should be incorporated in each department's and agency's emergency preparedness plans and programs to provide appropriate and effective response options for consideration in reacting to ambiguous and specific warnings.</P><P>(c) Departments and agencies will be provided early warning information developed by the intelligence community and policy statements of the President.</P><P>(d) Emergency resource preparedness planning is essential to ensure that the nation is adequately prepared to respond to potential national emergencies. Such emergency resource preparedness planning requires an exchange of information and planning factors among the various departments and agencies responsible for different resource preparedness actitivities.</P><P>(e) To carry out their emergency planning activities, civilian departments and agencies require the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potential military demands that would be made on the economy in a full range of possible national security emergencies. Similarly, DOD planning should be conducted using planning regimes consistent with the policies and plans of the civilian resource departments and agencies.</P><P>(f) Under section 104(c) of Executive Order 12656, FEMA is responsible for coordinating the implementation of national emergency preparedness policy with Federal departments and agencies and with state and local governments and, therefore, is responsible for developing a system of planning procedures for integrating the emergency preparedness actions of federal, state and local governments.</P><P>(g) Federal departments and agencies shall design their preparedness measures to permit a rapid and effective transition from routine to emergency operations, and to make effective use of the period following initial indication of a probable national security emergency. This will include:</P><P>(1) Development of a system of emergency actions that defines alternatives, processes, and issues to be considered during various stages of national security emergencies; and</P><P>(2) Identification of actions that could be taken at the Federal and local levels of government in the early stages of a national security emergency or pending national security emergency to mitigate the impact of or reduce significantly the leadtime associated with full emergency action implementation.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 334.3" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.82.0.10.3" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 334.3 Background.</HEAD><P>(a) The GMR system is designed to take into account the need to mobilize the Nation's resources in response to a wide range of crisis or emergency situations. GMR is a flexible decision making process of preparedness and response actions which are appropriate to warning indicators or an event. Thus, GMR allows the government, as a whole, to take small or large, often reversible, steps to increase its national security emergency preparedness posture.</P><P>(b) Crises, especially those resulting in major military activities, always have some political or economic context. As the risks of military action increase, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer period of time to increase their military power. Such preparations by potential adversaries shape the nature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing of occurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicators of threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on the nature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warning indicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrial sectors.</P><P>(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planning and actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use it to reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence should fail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phased actions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essential civilian requirements.

This included a review of the existing emergency plans both in States with operating reactors and those with plants scheduled for operation in the near future.</P><P>(b) This assignment was given to FEMA because of its responsibilities under Executive Order 12148 to establish Federal policies for and coordinate civil emergency planning, management and assistance functions and to represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness programs. Under section 201 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5131), and other statutory functions, the Administrator of FEMA is charged with the responsibility to develop and implement plans and programs of disaster preparedness.</P><P>(c) There are two sections in the NRC's fiscal year 1982/1983 Appropriation Authorization (Pub. L. 97-415) that pertain to the scope of this rule.</P><P>(1) Section 5 provides for the issuance of an operating license for a commercial nuclear power plant by the NRC if it is determined that there exists a State, local or utility plan which provides assurance that public health and safety is not endangered by the operation of the facility. This section would allow the NRC to issue an operating license for such plants without FEMA-approved State and local government plans.</P><P>(2) Section 11 provides for the issuance of temporary licenses for operating a utilization facility at a specific power level to be determined by the Commission, pending final action by the Commission on the application. Also, this section authorizes the NRC to issue temporary operating licenses for these facilities without the completion of the required (NRC) Commission hearing process. A petition for such a temporary license may not be filed until certain actions are completed including the submission of a State, local or utility emergency response plan for the facility.</P><P>(d) To carry out these responsibilities, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope with the offsite effects resulting from radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. FEMA developed and published the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan 50 FR 46542 Nov. 8, 1985, to provide the overall support to State and local governments, for all types of radiological incidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants.</P><P>(e) FEMA has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the NRC to which it will furnish assessments, findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans and preparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). These findings and determinations will be used by NRC under its own rules in connection with its licensing and regulatory requirements and FEMA will support its findings in the NRC licensing process and related court proceedings.</P><P>(f) Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in these rules for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings and determinations on the current status of emergency preparedness around particular sites may be requested by the NRC and provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. These findings and determinations may be based upon plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA by the NRC through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.</P><P>(g) An environmental assessment has been prepared on which FEMA has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[48 FR 44335, Sept. 28, 1983, as amended at 51 FR 34606, Sept. 30, 1986]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 350.4" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.84.0.10.4" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 350.4 Exclusions.</HEAD><P>The regulation in this part does not apply to, nor will FEMA apply any criteria with respect to, any evaluation, assessment or determination regarding the NRC licensee's emergency plans or preparedness, nor shall FEMA make any similar determination with respect to the integration of offsite and NRC licensee emergency preparedness except as these assessments and determinations affect the emergency preparedness of State and local governments.

Hence, Federal agencies, including FEMA Regional staff, will be made available upon request to assist States and localities in the development of plans.</P><P>(b) There now exists in each of the ten standard Federal Regions a Regional Assistance Committee (RAC) (formerly the Regional Advisory Committee) chaired by a FEMA Regional official and having members from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce. Whereas in 44 CFR part 351, the Department of Defense is listed as a potential member of the RACs, it is not listed in this rule because military nuclear facilities are not the subject of concern. The RACs will assist State and local government officials in the development of their radiological emergency response plans, and will review plans and observe exercises to evaluate the adequacy of these plans and related preparedness. This assistance does not include the actual writing of State and local government plans by RAC members.</P><P>(c) In accomplishing the foregoing, the RACs will use the standards and criteria in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, and will render such technical assistance as may be required, appropriate to their agency mission and expertise. In observing and evaluating exercises, the RACs will identify, soon after an exercise, any deficiencies observed in the planning and preparedness effort including deficiencies in resources, training of staff, equipment, staffing levels and deficiencies in the qualifications of personnel.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 350.7" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.84.0.10.7" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 350.7 Application by State for review and approval.</HEAD><P>(a) A State which seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiological emergency plan shall submit an application for such review and approval to the FEMA Regional Administrator of the Region in which the State is located. The application, in the form of a letter from the Governor or from such other State official as the Governor may designate, shall contain one copy of the completed State plan, including coverage of response in the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. The application will also include plans of all appropriate local governments. The application shall specify the site or sites for which plan approval is sought. For guidance on the local government plans that should be included with an application, refer to Part I.E. NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, entitled Contiguous Jurisdiction Governmental Emergency Planning (see (e)). Only a State may request formal review of State or local radiological emergency plans.</P><P>(b) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power facilities shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 Km) in radius and the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 Km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power facility shall be determined by State and local governments in consultation with FEMA and NRC taking into account such local conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes and local jurisdiction boundaries. The size of the EPZs may be determined by NRC in consultation with FEMA on a case-by-case basis for gas cooled reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 Mw thermal. The plans for the ingestion exposure pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the public from ingesting contaminated food and water.</P><P>(c) A State may submit separately its plans for the EPZs and the local government plans related to individual nuclear power facilities. The purpose of separate submissions is to allow approval of a State plan, and of the plans necessary for specific nuclear power facilities in a multiple-facility State, while not approving or acting on the plans necessary for other nuclear power facilities within the State. If separate submissions are made, appropriate adjustments in the State plan may be necessary. In any event, FEMA approval of State plans and appropriate local government plans shall be site specific.</P><P>(d) The applications shall contain a statement that the State plan, together with the appropriate local plans, is, in the opinion of the State, adequate to protect the public health and safety of its citizens living within the emergency planning zones for the nuclear power facilities included in the submission by providing reasonable assurance that State and local governments can and intend to effect appropriate protective measures offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.</P><P>(e) FEMA and the States will make suitable arrangements in the case of overlapping or adjacent jurisdictions to permit an orderly assessment and approval of interstate or interregional plans.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 350.8" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.84.0.10.8" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 350.8 Initial FEMA action on State plan.</HEAD><P>(a) The Regional Administrator shall acknowledge in writing within ten days the receipt of the State application.</P><P>(b) FEMA shall publish a notice signed by the Regional Administrator or designee in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E></P><P>(c) The Regional Administrator shall furnish copies of the plan to members of the RAC for their analysis and evaluation.</P><P>(d) The Regional Administrator shall make a detailed review of the State plan, including those of local governments, and assess the capability of State and local governments to effectively implement the plan (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy).

The substantive changes in the new MOU are: (1) Self-initiated review by the NRC; (2) Early Site Permit process; (3) adoption of FEMA exercise time-frames; (4) incorporation of FEMA definition of exercise deficiency; (5) NRC commitment to work with licensees in support of State and local governments to correct exercise deficiencies; (6) correlation of FEMA actions on withdrawal of approvals under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC enforcement actions; and (7) disaster-initiated reviews in situations that affect offsite emergency infrastructures. The text of the MOU follows.</P><HD1>Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness
</HD1><HD2>I. Background and Purposes</HD2><P>This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes a framework of cooperation between the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in radiological emergency response planning matters so that their mutual efforts will be directed toward more effective plans and related preparedness measures at and in the vicinity of nuclear reactors and fuel cycle facilities which are subject to 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, and certain other fuel cycle and materials licensees which have potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases. The memorandum is responsive to the President's decision of December 7, 1979, that FEMA will take the lead in offsite planning and response, his request that NRC assist FEMA in carrying out this role, and the NRC's continuing statutory responsibility for the radiological health and safety of the public.</P><P>On January 14, 1980, the two agencies entered into a “Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA to Accomplish a Prompt Improvement in Radiological Emergency Preparedness,” that was responsive to the President's December 7, 1979, statement. A revised and updated Memorandum of Understanding became effective November 1, 1980. The MOU was further revised and updated on April 9, 1985. This MOU is a further revision to reflect the evolving relationship between NRC and FEMA and the experience gained in carrying out the provisions of the previous MOU's. This MOU supersedes these two earlier versions of the MOU.</P><P>The general principles agreed to in the previous MOU's and reaffirmed in this MOU, are as follows: FEMA coordinates all Federal planning for the offsite impact of radiological emergencies and takes the lead for assessing offsite radiological emergency response plans<SU>1</SU><FTREF/></P><FTNT><P><SU>1</SU></P></FTNT><P>A separate MOU dated October 22, 1980, deals with NRC/FEMA cooperation and responsibilities in response to an actual or potential radiological emergency. Operations Response Procedures have been developed that implement the provisions of the Incident Response MOU. These documents are intended to be consistent with the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan which describes the relationships, roles, and responsibilities of Federal Agencies for responding to accidents involving peacetime nuclear emergencies. On December 1, 1991, the NRC and FEMA also concluded a separate MOU in support of Executive Order 12657 (FEMA Assistance in Emergency Preparedness Planning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants).</P><HD2>II. Authorities and Responsibilities</HD2><P>FEMA-Executive Order 12148 charges the Director, FEMA, with the responsibility to “* * * establish Federal policies for, and coordinate, all civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and assistance functions of Executive agencies” (Section 2-101) and “* * * represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery programs” (Section 2-104.).</P><P>On December 7, 1979, the President, in response to the recommendations of the Kemeny Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, directed that FEMA assume lead responsibility for all offsite nuclear emergency planning and response.</P><P>Specifically, the FEMA responsibilities with respect to radiological emergency preparedness as they relate to NRC are:</P><P>1. To take the lead in offsite emergency planning and to review and assess offsite emergency plans and preparedness for adequacy.</P><P>2. To make findings and determinations as to whether offsite emergency plans are adequate and can be implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment). Notwithstanding the procedures which are set forth in 44 CFR part 350 for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings, and determinations on the current status of emergency planning and preparedness around particular sites, referred to as interim findings, will be provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. Such findings will be provided by FEMA on mutually agreed to schedules or on specific NRC request. The request and findings will normally be by written communications between the co-chairs of the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee. An interim finding provided under this arrangement will be an extension of FEMA's procedures for review and approval of offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness set forth in 44 CFR part 350. It will be based on the review of currently available plans and, if appropriate, joint exercise results related to a specific nuclear power plant site.</P><P>If the review involves an application under 10 CFR part 52 for an early site permit, the NRC will forward to FEMA pertinent information provided by the applicant and consult with FEMA as to whether there is any significant impediment to the development of offsite emergency plans. As appropriate, depending upon the nature of information provided by the applicant, the NRC will also request that FEMA determine whether major features of offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are acceptable, or whether offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are adequate, as discussed below.</P><P>An interim finding based only on the review of currently available offsite plans will include an assessment as to whether these plans are adequate when measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, and, pending a demonstration through an exercise, whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented. The finding will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) Plans are adequate and there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented with only limited or no corrections needed; (2) plans are adequate, but before a determination can be made as to whether they can be implemented, corrections must be made to the plans or supporting measures must be demonstrated (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment) or (3) plans are inadequate and cannot be implemented until they are revised to correct deficiencies noted in the Federal review.</P><P>If, in FEMA's view, the plans that are available are not completed or are not ready for review, FEMA will provide NRC with a status report delineating milestones for preparation of the plan by the offsite authorities as well as FEMA's actions to assist in timely development and review of the plans.</P><P>An interim finding on preparedness will be based on review of currently available plans and joint exercise results and will include an assessment as to (1) whether offsite emergency plans are adequate as measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1 and (2) whether the exercise(s) demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented.</P><P>An interim finding on preparedness will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in an exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision.</P><P>3. To assume responsibility, as a supplement to State, local, and utility efforts, for radiological emergency preparedness training of State and local officials.</P><P>4. To develop and issue an updated series of interagency assignments which delineate respective agency capabilities and responsibilities and define procedures for coordination and direction for emergency planning and response. [Current assignments are in 44 CFR part 351, March 11, 1982. (47 FR 10758)]</P><P>NRC-The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires that the NRC grant licenses only if the health and safety of the public is adequately protected. While the Atomic Energy Act does not specifically require emergency plans and related preparedness measures, the NRC requires consideration of overall emergency preparedness as a part of the licensing process. The NRC rules (10 CFR 50.33, 50.34, 50.47, 50.54, and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, and 10 CFR part 52) include requirements for the licensee's emergency plans.</P><P>Specifically, the NRC responsibilities for radiological emergency preparedness are:</P><P>1. To assess licensee emergency plans for adequacy. This review will include organizations with whom licensees have written agreements to provide onsite support services under emergency conditions.</P><P>2. To verify that licensee emergency plans are adequately implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment).</P><P>3. To review the FEMA findings and determinations as to whether offsite plans are adequate and can be implemented.</P><P>4. To make radiological health and safety decisions with regard to the overall state of emergency preparedness (i.e., integration of emergency preparedness onsite as determined by the NRC and offsite as determined by FEMA and reviewed by NRC) such as assurance for continued operation, for issuance of operating licenses, or for taking enforcement actions, such as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors.</P><HD2>III. Areas of Cooperation</HD2><HD3>A. NRC Licensing Reviews</HD3><P>FEMA will provide support to the NRC for licensing reviews related to reactors, fuel facilities, and materials licensees with regard to the assessment of the adequacy of offsite radiological emergency response plans and preparedness. This will include timely submittal of an evaluation suitable for inclusion in NRC safety evaluation reports.</P><P>Substantially prior to the time that a FEMA evaluation is required with regard to fuel facility or materials license review, NRC will identify those fuel and materials licensees with potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases and transmit a request for review to FEMA as the emergency plans are completed.</P><P>FEMA routine support will include providing assessments, findings and determinations (interim and final) on offsite plans and preparedness related to reactor license reviews. To support its findings and determinations, FEMA will make expert witnesses available before the Commission, the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, NRC hearing boards and administrative law judges, for any court actions, and during any related discovery proceedings.</P><P>FEMA will appear in NRC licensing proceedings as part of the presentation of the NRC staff. FEMA counsel will normally present FEMA witnesses and be permitted, at the discretion of the NRC licensing board, to cross-examine the witnesses of parties, other than the NRC witnesses, on matters involving FEMA findings and determinations, policies, or operations; however, FEMA will not be asked to testify on status reports. FEMA is not a party to NRC proceedings and, therefore, is not subject to formal discovery requirements placed upon parties to NRC proceedings. Consistent with available resources, however, FEMA will respond informally to discovery requests by parties. Specific assignment of professional responsibilities between NRC and FEMA counsel will be primarily the responsibility of the attorneys assigned to a particular case. In situations where questions of professional responsibility cannot be resolved by the attorneys assigned, resolution of any differences will be made by the General Counsel of FEMA and the General Counsel of the NRC or their designees. NRC will request the presiding Board to place FEMA on the service list for all litigation in which it is expected to participate.</P><P>Nothing in this MOU shall be construed in any way to diminish NRC's responsibility for protecting the radiological health and safety of the public.</P><HD3>B. FEMA Review of Offsite Plans and Preparedness</HD3><P>NRC will assist in the development and review of offsite plans and preparedness through its membership on the Regional Assistance Committees (RAC). FEMA will chair the Regional Assistance Committees. Consistent with NRC's statutory responsibility, NRC will recognize FEMA as the interface with State and local governments for interpreting offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness criteria as they affect those governments and for reporting to those governments the results of any evaluation of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness.</P><P>Where questions arise concerning the interpretation of the criteria, such questions will continue to be referred to FEMA Headquarters, and when appropriate, to the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee to assure uniform interpretation.</P><HD3>C. Preparation for and Evaluation of Joint Exercises</HD3><P>FEMA and NRC will cooperate in determining exercise requirements for licensees, and State and local governments. They will also jointly observe and evaluate exercises. NRC and FEMA will institute procedures to enhance the review of objectives and scenarios for joint exercises. This review is to assure that both the onsite considerations of NRC and the offsite considerations of FEMA are adequately addressed and integrated in a manner that will provide for a technically sound exercise upon which an assessment of preparedness capabilities can be based. The NRC/FEMA procedures will provide for the availability of exercise objectives and scenarios sufficiently in advance of scheduled exercises to allow enough time for adequate review by NRC and FEMA and correction of any deficiencies by the licensee. The failure of a licensee to develop a scenario that adequately addresses both onsite and offsite considerations may result in NRC taking enforcement actions.</P><P>The FEMA reports will be a part of an interim finding on emergency preparedness; or will be the result of an exercise conducted pursuant to FEMA's review and approval procedures under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC's requirement under 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, Section IV.F. Exercise evaluations will identify one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in the exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision. The schedule for issuance of the draft and final exercise reports will be as shown in FEMA-REP-14 (Radiological Emergency Preparedness Exercise Manual).</P><P>The deficiency referred to in (2) above is defined as an observed or identified inadequacy of organizational performance in an exercise that could cause a finding that offsite emergency preparedness is not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Because of the potential impact of deficiencies on emergency preparedness, they should be corrected within 120 days through appropriate remedial actions, including remedial exercises, drills, or other actions.</P><P>Where there are deficiencies of the types noted above, and when there is a potential for remedial actions, FEMA Headquarters will promptly (1-2 days) discuss these with NRC Headquarters. Within 10 days of the exercise, official notification of identified deficiencies will be made by FEMA to the State, NRC Headquarters, and the RAC with an information copy to the licensee. NRC will formally notify the licensee of the deficiencies and monitor the licensee's efforts to work with State and local authorities to correct the deficiencies. Approximately 60 days after official notification of the deficiency, the NRC, in consultation with FEMA, will assess the progress being made toward resolution of the deficiencies.</P><HD3>D. Withdrawal of Reasonable Assurance Finding</HD3><P>If FEMA determines under 44 CFR 350.13 of its regulations that offsite emergency plans or preparedness are not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public, FEMA shall, as described in its rule, withdraw approval.</P><P>Upon receiving notification of such action from FEMA, the NRC will promptly review FEMA's findings and determinations and formally document the NRC's position. When, as described in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii) and 50.54(s)(3) of its regulations, the NRC finds the state of emergency preparedness does not provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency, the NRC will notify the affected licensee accordingly and start the “120-day clock.”<SU>2</SU><FTREF/></P><FTNT><P><SU>2</SU><I>or at any time other than that specified in this paragraph</I></P></FTNT><HD3>E. Emergency Planning and Preparedness Guidance</HD3><P>NRC has lead responsibility for the development of emergency planning and preparedness guidance for licensees. FEMA has lead responsibility for the development of radiological emergency planning and preparedness guidance for State and local agencies. NRC and FEMA recognize the need for an integrated, coordinated approach to radiological emergency planning and preparedness by NRC licensees and State and local governments. NRC and FEMA will each, therefore, provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on such guidance (including interpretations of agreed joint guidance) prior to adoption as formal agency guidance.</P><HD3>F. Support for Document Management System</HD3><P>FEMA and NRC will each provide the other with continued access to those automatic data processing support systems which contain relevant emergency preparedness data.</P><HD3>G. Ongoing NRC Research and Development Programs</HD3><P>Ongoing NRC and FEMA research and development programs that are related to State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness will be coordinated. NRC and FEMA will each provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on relevant research and development programs prior to implementing them.</P><HD3>H. Public Information and Education Programs</HD3><P>FEMA will take the lead in developing public information and educational programs. NRC will assist FEMA by reviewing for accuracy educational materials concerning radiation, and its hazards and information regarding appropriate actions to be taken by the general public in the event of an accident involving radioactive materials.</P><HD3>I. Recovery from Disasters Affecting Offsite Emergency Preparedness</HD3><P>Disasters that destroy roads, buildings, communications, transportation resources or other offsite infrastructure in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant can degrade the capabilities of offsite response organizations in the 10-mile plume emergency planning zone. Examples of events that could cause such devastation are hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, major fires, large explosions, and riots.</P><P>If a disaster damages the area around a licensed operating nuclear power plant to an extent that FEMA seriously questions the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness, FEMA will inform the NRC promptly. Likewise, the NRC will inform FEMA promptly of any information it receives from licensees, its inspectors, or others, that raises serious questions about the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness. If FEMA concludes that a disaster-initiated review of offsite radiological emergency preparedness is necessary to determine if offsite emergency preparedness is still adequate, it will inform the NRC in writing, as soon as practicable, including a schedule for conduct of the review. FEMA will also give the NRC (1) interim written reports of its findings, as appropriate, and (2) a final written report on the results of its review.</P><P>The disaster-initiated review is performed to reaffirm the radiological emergency preparedness capabilities of affected offsite jurisdictions located in the 10-mile emergency planning zone and is not intended to be a comprehensive review of offsite plans and preparedness.</P><P>The NRC will consider information provided by FEMA Headquarters and pertinent findings from FEMA's disaster-initiated review in making decisions regarding the restart or continued operation of an affected operating nuclear power reactor. The NRC will notify FEMA Headquarters, in writing, of the schedule for restart of an affected reactor and keep FEMA Headquarters informed of changes in that schedule.</P><HD2>IV. NRC/FEMA Steering Committee</HD2><P>The NRC/FEMA Steering Committee on Emergency Preparedness will continue to be the focal point for coordination of emergency planning and preparedness. As discussed in Section I of this agreement, response activities between these two agencies are addressed in a separate MOU. The Steering Committee will consist of an equal number of members to represent each agency with one vote per agency. When the Steering Committee cannot agree on the resolution of an issue, the issue will be referred to NRC and FEMA management. The NRC members will have lead responsibility for licensee planning and preparedness and the FEMA members will have lead responsibility for offsite planning and preparedness. The Steering Committee will assure coordination of plans and preparedness evaluation activities and revise, as necessary, acceptance criteria for licensee, State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness. NRC and FEMA will then consider and adopt criteria, as appropriate, in their respective jurisdictions. (See Attachment 1).</P><HD2>V. Working Arrangements</HD2><P>A. The normal point of contact for implementation of the points in this MOU will be the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.</P><P>B. The Steering Committee will establish the day-to-day procedures for assuring that the arrangements of this MOU are carried out.</P><HD2>VI. Memorandum of Understanding</HD2><P>A. This MOU shall be effective as of date of signature and shall continue in effect unless terminated by either party upon 30 days notice in writing.</P><P>B.

The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 360.2" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.90.0.10.2" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 360.2 Description of program.</HEAD><P>(a) The program is designed for all States regardless of their present level of involvement in training or their degree of expertise in originating and presenting training courses in the past. The needs of individual States, difference in numbers to be trained, and levels of sophistication in any previous training program have been recognized. It is thus believed that all States are best able to meet their own unique situations and those of local government by being given this opportunity and flexibility.</P><P>(b) Each State is asked to submit an acceptable application, to be accompanied by a Training and Education (T&amp;E) plan for a total of three years, only the first year of which will be required to be detailed. The remaining two year program should be presented in terms of ongoing training objectives and programs. In the first year plan applicants shall delineate their objectives in training and education, including a description of the programs to be offered, and identify the audiences and numbers to be trained. Additionally, the State is asked to note the month in which the activity is to be presented, the location, and cost estimates including instructional costs and participant's travel and per diem. These specifics of date, place, and costs will be required for the first year of any three year plan. A three year plan will be submitted each year with an application. Each negotiated agreement will include a section of required training (Radiological Defense), and a section including optional courses to be conducted in response to State and local needs.</P><P>(c) FEMA support to the States in their training program for State and local officials, has been designed around three Program elements. Each activity listed in the State Training and Education (T&amp;E) Plan will be derived from the following three elements:</P><P>(1)<I>Government Conducted Courses:</I></P><P>(i) Career Development Courses: Phases I, II, and III,</P><P>(ii) Radiological Officer and Instructor Courses,</P><P>(iii) Technical Workshops on Disaster Recovery or Hazard Mitigation.</P><P>(2)<I>Government and recipient conducted courses:</I></P><P>(i) Emergency Management Workshops,</P><P>(ii) Multijurisdictional Emergency Operations Simulation Training.</P><FP>In this category also, it is expected that the State will be responsible for administrative and logistical requirements, plus any instructional activity as agreed upon prior to the conduct of the course.

States will develop their proposals, using the target figure to develop their scope of work. Adjustments in funding and the scope of work will be subject to negotiation before finalization. Both the funding and the scope of work will be reviewed each year and adjustments in the out years will reflect increased sophistication and expertise of the States as well as changing training needs within each State.</P><P>(e)(1) FEMA funding through the State Cooperative Agreement for the training activities is to be used for travel and per diem expenses of students selected by the States for courses reflecting individually needed or required training. Additionally funds may be expended for course materials and instructor expenses. The funding provided in the State Cooperative Agreement is not for the purpose of conducting ongoing State activities or for funding staff positions to accomplish work to be performed under this Agreement.

The percentage, to be determined by FEMA, may be increased by no more than 5 percent annually, beginning at 15 percent in fiscal year 1991 with a limit of 50 percent of the total State project. The increase will take into account the amount of time a State has been participating in the program.

States which received a grant before October 1, 1990, which included the 50 percent non-Federal contribution to the State program, will continue to match the Federal funds on a 50 percent cash match basis.</P><P>(b) States which did not receive a grant before October 1, 1990, will assume cost sharing on a phased-in basis over a period of four years with the full cost sharing requirements being implemented in the fourth year. The sequence is as follows:</P><P>(1) For the first fiscal year, cost sharing will be voluntary. FEMA will provide State assistance without requiring a State match. Those States that are able to cost-share are encouraged to do so (on either a cash or in-kind basis).</P><P>(2) For the second fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 25 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution.

The restrictions imposed by Transportation Order T-1 do not apply to other commodities, not within these restricted classes at the time of transportation or discharge, even though authorization for the export of the commodity from the United States to the particular destination is required under regulations of the Office of International Trade or under other Federal law or regulation.

(Note, however, that Order T-2 prohibits American flag ships and aircraft from calling at any port or other place in Communist China.) For example, an American flag ship may call at one of the restricted ports (except one in Communist China), even though it has on board the following classes of commodities:</P><P>(a) A Positive List commodity manifested to a destination outside the restricted area, with an export license and an export declaration showing the unrestricted destination at the ultimate destination, (b) a Positive List commodity destined for the restricted port of call which cannot be discharged there because there is no export license or authorization from the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business permitting discharge at the restricted port of call, (c) a commodity of any kind destined for Communist China (the transportation and discharge of which is covered by Order T-2). None of these commodities may be discharged at the restricted port of call.

The restrictions of Order T-1 do not apply to transportation by foreign carriers, as long as there is no prohibited transportation or discharge by or from a United States flag ship or aircraft after the issuance of Order T-1. Accordingly, if an American flag ship or aircraft, before the issuance of Order T-1, had transported restricted commodities manifested to restricted destinations, and had completed the transportation to a foreign intermediate point and had completed the discharge from the American flag ship or aircraft before the issuance of Order T-1, no violation of that order would have occurred, but Order T-1 would prohibit further shipment on an American flag ship or aircraft unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 402.6" NODE="44:1.0.2.7.3.0.10.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 402.6 Relation to Transportation Order T-2.</HEAD><P>Transportation Order T-1 applies to the transportation of commodities to, or in transit to, destinations in Sub-Group A, Hong Kong or Macao.

Transportation Order T-2 applies to the transportation of commodities of any kind which are destined to Communist China (Order T-2 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in Communist China).
