Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the FOI/PA Office. Requests for expedited processing that are based on paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must be submitted to the component processing the request. A component that receives a misdirected request for expedited processing under the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall forward it immediately to the FOI/PA Office for its determination. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall commence on the date that the FOI/PA Office receives the request, provided that it is routed within 10 working days.</P><P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a notarized statement, such as an affidavit or declaration, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the SBA may waive the formal certification requirement.</P><P>(4) A component shall notify the requester within 10 working days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 102.6" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.3.1.1.6" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 102.6 Responses to requests.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>In general.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Acknowledgments of requests.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</I></P><P>(d)<I>Grants of requests.</I></P><P>(e)<I>Adverse determinations of requests.</I></P><P>(1) The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part;</P><P>(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;</P><P>(3) The information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA;</P><P>(4) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or</P><P>(5) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.</P><P>(f)<I>Content of denial.</I></P><P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P><P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;</P><P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P><P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 102.9, and a description of the appeal requirements; and</P><P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the component's FOIA Public Liaison or designee, and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.</P><P>(g)<I>Markings on released documents.</I></P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 102.7" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.3.1.1.7" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 102.7 Confidential commercial information.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Definitions.</I></P><P><I>Confidential commercial information</I></P><P><I>Submitter</I></P><P>(b)<I>Designation of confidential commercial information.</I></P><P>(c)<I>When notice to submitters is required.</I></P><P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P><P>(ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.</P><P>(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information.

The component shall provide a timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and SBA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.</P><P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P><P>(4) Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other designee to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P><P>(g)<I>Charges for other services.</I></P><P>(h)<I>Charging interest.</I></P><P>(i)<I>Aggregating requests.</I></P><P>(j)<I>Advance payments.</I><I>i.e.,</I></P><P>(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. Components may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.</P><P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or SBA within 30 working days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before SBA begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. When a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P><P>(4) In cases in which advanced payment is required, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received.

The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P><P>(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P><P>(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P><P>(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. Components shall presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P><P>(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the following criteria will be considered:</P><P>(A) Identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P><P>(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, a determination will be made whether the primary interest is furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. Ordinarily there will be a presumption, that when a news media requester has satisfied factors (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P><P>(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.</P><P>(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 102.9" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.3.1.1.9" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 102.9 Administrative appeals.</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Requirements for making an appeal.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Adjudication of appeals.</I></P><P>(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.</P><P>(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the FOI/PA Office shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with Executive Orders 13467 and 13526.</P><P>(c)<I>Decisions on appeals.</I></P><P>(d) Time limit for issuing appeal decision.

SBA will consider a depository institution to be in compliance with this section if it meets the definition of “well capitalized” used by its bank regulator. SBA's capital requirement does not change the requirements that banks already meet. For nondepository institutions, SBA, as the regulator, will consider a non-depository institution to be “well capitalized” if it maintains a minimum unencumbered paid in capital and paid in surplus equal to at least 10 percent of its assets, excluding the guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans. The capital charge applies to the remaining balance outstanding on the unguaranteed portion of the securitizer's 7(a) loans in its portfolio and in any securitization pools. Each nondepository institution must submit annual audited financial statements demonstrating that it has met SBA's capital requirement.</P><P>(b) Subordinated Tranche—A securitizer or its wholly owned subsidiary must retain a tranche of the securities issued in the securitization (subordinated tranche) equal to the greater of two times the securitizer's Loss Rate or 2 percent of the principal balance outstanding at the time of securitization of the unguaranteed portion of the loans in the securitization. This tranche must be subordinate to all other securities issued in the securitization including other subordinated tranches. The securitizer or its wholly owned subsidiary may not sell, pledge, transfer, assign, sell participations in, or otherwise convey the subordinated tranche during the first 6 years after the closing date of the securitization. The securities evidencing the subordinated tranche must bear a legend stating that the securities may not be sold until 6 years after the issue date. SBA's Securitization Committee may modify the formula for determining the tranche size for a securitizer creating a securitization from a pool of loans located in a region affected by a severe economic downturn if the Securitization Committee concludes that enforcing this section might exacerbate the adverse economic conditions in the region.

This paragraph applies to all NFRLs on or after January 4, 2021, including in the event of approval of a new NFRL or a change of ownership or control of an NFRL; provided however, that if SBA has approved any NFRL to make 7(a) loans out of their state, then this paragraph will apply on or after January 4, 2022.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[73 FR 75512, Dec. 11, 2008, as amended at 85 FR 78213, Dec. 4, 2020]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 120.461" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.16.4.217.27" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 120.461 What are SBA's additional requirements for SBA Supervised Lenders concerning records?</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Report filing.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Maintenance of records.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Permanent preservation of records.</I></P><P>(1) All general and subsidiary ledgers (or other records) reflecting asset, liability, capital stock and additional paid-in capital, income, and expense accounts;</P><P>(2) All general and special journals (or other records forming the basis for entries in such ledgers); and</P><P>(3) The corporate charter, bylaws, application for determination of eligibility to participate with SBA, and all minutes books, capital stock certificates or stubs, stock ledgers, and stock transfer registers.</P><P>(d)<I>Other preservation of records.</I></P><P>(1) All applications for financing;</P><P>(2) Lending, participation, and escrow agreements;</P><P>(3) Financing instruments; and</P><P>(4) All other documents and supporting material relating to such loans, including correspondence.</P><P>(e)<I>Electronic preservation.</I></P><CITA TYPE="N">[73 FR 75512, Dec. 11, 2008]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 120.462" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.16.4.217.28" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 120.462 What are SBA's additional requirements on capital maintenance for SBA Supervised Lenders?</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Minimum capital requirements</I><I>For NFRLs.</I></P><P>(ii) Any NFRL approved on or after January 4, 2021, including in the event of a change of ownership or control, must maintain the minimum capital requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</P><P>(iii) Unless subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, an NFRL must comply with the minimum capital requirements for NFRLs that were in effect on January 3, 2021.</P><P>(2)<I>For SBLCs.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Capital adequacy.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Capital plan.</I></P><P>(i) Management capability;</P><P>(ii) Quality of operating policies, procedures, and internal controls;</P><P>(iii) Quality and quantity of earnings;</P><P>(iv) Asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses within the loan portfolio;</P><P>(v) Sufficiency of liquidity; and</P><P>(vi) Any other risk-oriented activities or conditions that warrant additional capital (e.g., portfolio growth rate).</P><P>(2) An SBA Supervised Lender must keep its capital plan current, updating it at least annually or more often as operating conditions may warrant.</P><P>(d)<I>Certification of compliance.</I></P><P>(e)<I>Capital impairment.</I></P><P>(f)<I>Capital restoration plan</I><I>Filing requirement.</I></P><P>(2)<I>Plan content.</I></P><P>(3)<I>SBA response.</I></P><P>(4)<I>Amendment of capital restoration plan.</I></P><P>(5)<I>Failure.</I></P><CITA TYPE="N">[73 FR 75512, Dec. 11, 2008, as amended at 85 FR 78213, Dec. 4, 2020]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 120.463" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.16.4.217.29" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 120.463 Regulatory accounting—What are SBA's regulatory accounting requirements for SBA Supervised Lenders?</HEAD><P>(a)<I>Books and records.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Annual audit.</I></P><P>(c)<I>Auditor qualifications.</I></P><P>(1) Is registered or licensed to practice as a certified public accountant, and is in good standing, under the laws of the state or other political subdivision of the United States in which the SBA Supervised Lender's principal office is located;</P><P>(2) Agrees in the engagement letter with the SBA Supervised Lender to provide the SBA with access to and copies of any work papers, policies, and procedures relating to the services performed;</P><P>(3)(i) Is in compliance with the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct; and</P><P>(ii) Meets the independence requirements and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff;</P><P>(4) Has received a peer review or is enrolled in a peer review program, that meets AICPA guidelines; and</P><P>(5) Is otherwise acceptable to SBA.</P><P>(d)<I>Change of auditor.</I></P><P>(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the discharged auditor; and</P><P>(2) If the discharge/change involved a dispute over the financial statements, a reasonably detailed statement of all the reasons for the discharge or change.

In addition, affiliation will not be found based upon the performance of common administrative services so long as adequate payment is provided for those services. Affiliation may be found for other reasons.</P><P>(A) Common administrative services which are subject to the exception to affiliation include, bookkeeping, payroll, recruiting, other human resource support, cleaning services, and other duties which are otherwise unrelated to contract performance or management and can be reasonably pooled or otherwise performed by a holding company, parent entity, or sister business concern without interfering with the control of the subject firm.</P><P>(B) Contract administration services include both services that could be considered “common administrative services” under the exception to affiliation and those that could not.</P><P>(<I>1</I></P><P>(<I>2</I><I>e.g.,</I></P><P>(C) Business development may include both services that could be considered “common administrative services” under the exception to affiliation and those that could not. Efforts at the holding company or parent level to identify possible procurement opportunities for specific subsidiary companies may properly be considered “common administrative services” under the exception to affiliation. However, at some point the opportunity identified by the holding company's or parent entity's business development efforts becomes concrete enough to assign to a subsidiary and at that point the subsidiary must be involved in the business development efforts for such opportunity. At the proposal or bid preparation stage of business development, the appropriate subsidiary company for the opportunity has been identified and a representative of that company must be involved in preparing an appropriate offer. This does not mean to imply that one or more representatives of a holding company or parent entity cannot also be involved in preparing an offer. They may be involved in assisting with preparing the generic part of an offer, but the specific subsidiary that intends to ultimately perform the contract must control the technical and contract specific portions of preparing an offer. In addition, once award is made, employee assignments and the logistics for contract performance must be controlled by the specific subsidiary company and should not be performed at a holding company or parent entity level.</P><P>(3) Business concerns which are part of an SBA approved pool of concerns for a joint program of research and development or for defense production as authorized by the Small Business Act are not affiliates of one another because of the pool.</P><P>(4) Business concerns which lease employees from concerns primarily engaged in leasing employees to other businesses or which enter into a co-employer arrangement with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) are not affiliated with the leasing company or PEO solely on the basis of a leasing agreement.</P><P>(5) For financial, management or technical assistance under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (an applicant is not affiliated with the investors listed in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) through (vi) of this section.</P><P>(i) Venture capital operating companies, as defined in the U.S. Department of Labor regulations found at 29 CFR 2510.3-101(d);</P><P>(ii) Employee benefit or pension plans established and maintained by the Federal government or any state, or their political subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, for the benefit of employees;</P><P>(iii) Employee benefit or pension plans within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1001,<I>et seq.</I></P><P>(iv) Charitable trusts, foundations, endowments, or similar organizations exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 501(c));</P><P>(v) Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act) (15 U.S.C. 80a-1,<I>et seq.</I></P><P>(vi) Entities determined by SBA to be Traditional Investment Companies under 13 CFR 107.150(b)(2) and private funds exempt from registration under section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.</P><P>(6) A firm that has an SBA-approved mentor-protégé agreement authorized under § 125.9 of this chapter is not affiliated with its mentor or protégé firm solely because the protégé firm receives assistance from the mentor under the agreement.

The agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers with due consideration of the capabilities of the subcontractors.</P><P>(10)(i) The relationship of a faith-based organization to another organization is not considered an affiliation with the other organization under this subpart if the relationship is based on a religious teaching or belief or otherwise constitutes a part of the exercise of religion. In addition, the eligibility criteria set forth in 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)(D) are satisfied for any faith-based organization having not more than 500 employees (including individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis) that pays Federal payroll taxes using its own Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number (EIN) or that would support a deduction under the second sentence of 26 U.S.C. 512(b)(12) if the organization generated unrelated business taxable income. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(10), the term “faith-based organization” includes, but is not limited to, any organization associated with a church or convention or association of churches within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 414(e)(3)(D). The term “organization” has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 414(m)(6)(A). The terms “church” and “convention or association of churches” have the same meaning that they have in 26 U.S.C. 414.</P><P>(ii) No specific process or filing is necessary to claim the benefit of the exemption in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. In applying for a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a faith-based organization may make all necessary certifications with respect to common ownership or management or other eligibility criteria based upon affiliation, if the organization would be an eligible borrower but for application of SBA affiliation rules and if the organization falls within the terms of the exemption described in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. If a faith-based organization indicates any relationship that may pertain to affiliation, such as ownership of, ownership by, or common management with any other organization, on or in connection with a loan application, and if the faith-based organization applying for a loan falls within the terms of the exemption described in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section with respect to that relationship, the faith-based organization may indicate on a separate sheet that it is entitled to the exemption. That sheet may be identified as addendum A, and no further listing of the other organization or description of the relationship to that organization is required.

This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power to control does not in fact exist.</P><P>(3) If a concern's voting stock is widely held and no single block of stock is large as compared with all other stock holdings, the concern's Board of Directors and CEO or President will be deemed to have the power to control the concern in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</P><P>(d)<I>Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge.</I></P><P>(2) Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not considered “agreements in principle” and are thus not given present effect.</P><P>(3) Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject to conditions precedent which are incapable of fulfillment, speculative, conjectural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is shown to be extremely remote, are not given present effect.</P><P>(4) An individual, concern or other entity that controls one or more other concerns cannot use options, convertible securities, or agreements to appear to terminate such control before actually doing so. SBA will not give present effect to individuals', concerns' or other entities' ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest in order to avoid a finding of affiliation.</P><P>(e)<I>Affiliation based on common management.</I></P><P>(f)<I>Affiliation based on identity of interest.</I></P><P>(1) Firms owned or controlled by married couples, parties to a civil union, parents, children, and siblings are presumed to be affiliated with each other if they conduct business with each other, such as subcontracts or joint ventures or share or provide loans, resources, equipment, locations or employees with one another. This presumption may be overcome by showing a clear line of fracture between the concerns.

Where a concern may legally exclude certain revenue for tax purposes, SBA will not include that revenue in its analysis. However, SBA may consider other relevant information where there is reasonable basis to believe the tax filings are false.</P><P>(2) When a concern has not filed a Federal income tax return with the IRS for a fiscal year which must be included in the period of measurement, SBA will calculate the concern's annual receipts for that year using any other available information, such as the concern's regular books of account, audited financial statements, or information contained in an affidavit by a person with personal knowledge of the facts.</P><P>(b)<I>Completed fiscal year</I></P><P>(c)<I>Period of measurement.</I></P><P>(2) Except for the Business Loan, Disaster Loan Programs, Surety Bond Guarantee, and SBIC Programs, annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for less than 5 complete fiscal years means the total receipts for the period the concern has been in business divided by the number of weeks in business, multiplied by 52.</P><P>(3) Except for the Business Loan, Disaster Loan, Surety Bond Guarantee, and SBIC Programs, where a concern has been in business 5 or more complete fiscal years but has a short year as one of the years within its period of measurement, annual receipts means the total receipts for the short year and the 4 full fiscal years divided by the total number of weeks in the short year and the 4 full fiscal years, multiplied by 52.</P><P>(4) For the Business Loan, Disaster Loan, Surety Bond Guarantee, and SBIC Programs, a concern that has been in business for three or more completed fiscal years may elect to calculate annual receipts using either the total receipts of the concern over its most recently completed 5 fiscal years divided by 5, or the total receipts of the concern over its most recently completed 3 fiscal years divided by 3. Annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for less than three complete fiscal years means the total receipts for the period the concern has been in business divided by the number of weeks in business, multiplied by 52. Where a concern has been in business three or more complete fiscal years but has a short year as one of the years within its period of measurement, annual receipts means the total receipts for the short year and the two full fiscal years divided by the total number of weeks in the short year and the two full fiscal years, multiplied by 52. For the purposes of this subsection, the Business Loan Programs consist of the 7(a) Loan Program, the Microloan Program, the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, and the Development Company Loan Program (“504 Loan Program”).

This aggregation applies for the entire period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose. However, if a concern has acquired a segregable division of another business concern during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the annual receipts used in determining size status do not include the receipts of the acquired division prior to the acquisition.</P><P>(3) Except for the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs, if the business concern or an affiliate has been in business for a period of less than 5 years, the receipts for the fiscal year with less than a 12-month period are annualized in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Receipts are determined for the concern and its affiliates in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section even though this may result in using a different period of measurement to calculate an affiliate's annual receipts.</P><P>(4) The annual receipts of a former affiliate are not included if affiliation ceased before the date used for determining size.

SBA interprets this statutory definition to require, in certain circumstances, the inclusion of other entities (“Affiliates”) owned by the applicant or an owner of the applicant in determining the size of the applicant.</P><P>(a) For Business Loans (other than for 7(a) Business Loans) and for Disaster Loans (other than physical disaster loans), an applicant business concern must satisfy two criteria:</P><P>(1) The size of the applicant alone (without affiliates) must not exceed the size standard designated for the industry in which the applicant is primarily engaged; and</P><P>(2) The size of the applicant combined with its affiliates must not exceed the size standard designated for either the primary industry of the applicant alone or the primary industry of the applicant and its affiliates, which ever is higher. These size standards are set forth in § 121.201.</P><P>(b) For 7(a) Business Loans and Development Company programs, an applicant business concern must meet one of the following standards:</P><P>(1) The same standards applicable under paragraph (a) of this section; or</P><P>(2) Including its affiliates, tangible net worth not in excess of $20 million, and average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry over losses) for the preceding two completed fiscal years not in excess of $6.5 million.</P><P>(i) If the applicant is not required by law to pay State (and local, if any) income taxes at the enterprise level, multiply its net income by the marginal State income tax rate (or by the combined State and local income tax rates, as applicable) that would have applied if it were a taxable corporation.</P><P>(ii) Multiply the applicant's net income, less any deduction for State and local income taxes calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, by the marginal Federal income tax rate that would have applied if the applicant were a taxable corporation.</P><P>(iii) Sum the results obtained in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P><P>(c) For the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, an applicant must meet one of the following standards:</P><P>(1) The same standards applicable under paragraph (a) of this section; or</P><P>(2) Including its affiliates, tangible net worth not in excess of $24 million, and average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding two completed fiscal years not in excess of $8 million. If the applicant is not required by law to pay Federal income taxes at the enterprise level, but is required to pass income through to its shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, or other equitable owners, the applicant's “net income after Federal income taxes” will be its net income reduced by an amount computed as follows:</P><P>(i) If the applicant is not required by law to pay State (and local, if any) income taxes at the enterprise level, multiply its net income by the marginal State income tax rate (or by the combined State and local income tax rates, as applicable) that would have applied if it were a taxable corporation.</P><P>(ii) Multiply the applicant's net income, less any deduction for State and local income taxes calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, by the marginal Federal income tax rate that would have applied if the applicant were a taxable corporation.</P><P>(iii) Add the results obtained in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P><P>(d) For Surety Bond Guarantee assistance—a business concern, combined with its affiliates, must meet the size standard for the primary industry in which such business concern, combined with its affiliates, is engaged.</P><P>(e) The applicable size standards for purposes of SBA's financial assistance programs, excluding the Surety Bond Guarantee assistance program, are increased by 25 percent whenever the applicant agrees to use all of the financial assistance within a labor surplus area. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issues the Labor Surplus Area (LSA) list on a fiscal year basis on its website at<I>www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/lsa.</I></P><P>(f)<I>Affiliation.</I></P><P>(1)<I>Ownership.</I></P><P>(ii) When a business owns more than 50 percent of an Applicant, the business that owns the Applicant is affiliated with the Applicant. Additionally, if the business entity owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant also owns more than 50 percent of another business that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, then the business entity owner, the other business and the Applicant are all affiliated.</P><P>(iii) When an individual owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant and the individual also owns more than 50 percent of another business entity that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the individual owner's other business entity are affiliated.</P><P>(iv) When the Applicant does not have an owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant, if an owner of 20 percent or more of the Applicant is a business that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the owner are affiliated.</P><P>(v) When the Applicant does not have an owner that owns more than 50 percent of the Applicant, if an owner of 20 percent or more of the Applicant also owns more than 50 percent of another business entity that operates in the same 3-digit NAICS subsector as the Applicant, the Applicant and the owner's other business entity are affiliated.</P><P>(vi) Ownership interests of spouses and minor children must be combined when determining amount of ownership interest.</P><P>(vii) When determining the percentage of ownership that an individual owns in a business, SBA considers the pro rata ownership of entities. For example, John Smith, Jane Doe, and Jane Doe, Inc., each own an interest in the Applicant. Jane Doe owns 15 percent of the Applicant, and she also owns 100 percent of Jane Doe, Inc. Jane Doe, Inc. owns 50 percent of the Applicant. SBA considers Jane Doe to own 65 percent of the Applicant.</P><P>(2)<I>Stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge.</I></P><P>(ii) Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at a later date are not considered “agreements in principle” and are thus not given present effect.</P><P>(iii) Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject to conditions precedent which are incapable of fulfillment, speculative, conjectural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is shown to be extremely remote, are not given present effect.</P><P>(iv) SBA will not give present effect to individuals', concerns', or other entities' ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest to avoid a finding of affiliation.</P><P>(3)<I>Determining the concern's size.</I></P><P>(4)<I>Exceptions to affiliation.</I></P><P>(g) For COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster (COVID EIDL) loans, an “affiliated business” or “affiliate” is a business in which an eligible entity has an equity interest or right to profit distributions of not less than 50 percent, or in which an eligible entity has the contractual authority to control the direction of the business, provided that such affiliation shall be determined as of any arrangements or agreements in existence as of January 31, 2020.

Acquisitions for supplies must be classified under the appropriate manufacturing or supply NAICS code, not under a Wholesale Trade or Retail Trade NAICS code. A concern that submits an offer or quote for a contract, order, or subcontract where the NAICS code assigned to the contract, order, or subcontract is one for supplies, and furnishes a product it did not itself manufacture or produce, is categorized as a nonmanufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of § 121.406(b).</P><P>(c)<I>Multiple Award Contracts</I><I>see</I></P><P>(1) For a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer must:</P><P>(i) Assign the solicitation a single NAICS code and corresponding size standard which best describes the principal purpose of the acquisition as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, only if the NAICS code will also best describe the principal purpose of each order to be placed under the Multiple Award Contract; or</P><P>(ii) Divide the solicitation into discrete categories (such as Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), Special Item Numbers (SINs), Sectors, Functional Areas (FAs), or the equivalent), and assign each discrete category the single NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the goods or services to be acquired under that category (CLIN, SIN, Sector, FA or equivalent) as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

The NAICS code assigned to an order must be a NAICS code included in the underlying Multiple Award Contract. When placing an order under a Multiple Award Contract with multiple NAICS codes, the contracting officer must assign the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of each order. In cases where an agency can issue an order against multiple SINs with different NAICS codes, the contracting officer must select the single NAICS code that best represents the acquisition.

The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired. The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed. The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. Firms that add substances, parts, or components to an existing end item to modify its performance will not be considered the end item manufacturer where those identical modifications can be performed by and are available from the manufacturer of the existing end item:</P><P>(i) SBA will evaluate the following factors in determining whether a concern is the manufacturer of the end item:</P><P>(A) The proportion of total value in the end item added by the efforts of the concern, excluding costs of overhead, testing, quality control, and profit;</P><P>(B) The importance of the elements added by the concern to the function of the end item, regardless of their relative value; and</P><P>(C) The concern's technical capabilities; plant, facilities and equipment; production or assembly line processes; packaging and boxing operations; labeling of products; and product warranties.</P><P>(ii) Firms that provide computer and other information technology equipment primarily consisting of component parts (such as motherboards, video cards, network cards, memory, power supplies, storage devices, and similar items) who install components totaling less than 50% of the value of the end item are generally not considered the manufacturer of the end item.</P><P>(3) The nonmanufacturer rule applies only to procurements that have been assigned a manufacturing or supply NAICS code, or the Information Technology Value Added Resellers (ITVAR) exception to NAICS code 541519. The nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to contracts that have been assigned a service (except for the ITVAR exception to NAICS code 541519), construction, or specialty trade construction NAICS code.</P><P>(4) The nonmanufacturer rule applies only to the supply component of a requirement classified as a manufacturing, supply, or ITVAR contract. If a requirement is classified as a service contract, but also has a supply component, the nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to the supply component of the requirement. The rental of an item(s) is a service and should be treated as such in the application of the nonmanufacturer rule and the limitation on subcontracting.</P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (b)(4).</HED><PSPACE>A procuring agency seeks to acquire computer integration and maintenance services.

If the protest pertains to a requirement involving SBA's SBIR or STTR programs, the Area Director will also notify the Associate Administrator, Investment Division. If the protest involves the size status of an SDB concern (see part 124, subpart B of this chapter) the Area Director will notify SBA's Associate Administrator for Business Development. If the protest pertains to a requirement that has been reserved for competition among eligible 8(a) BD program participants, the Area Director will notify the SBA district office servicing the 8(a) concern whose size status has been protested. SBA will provide a copy of the protest to the protested concern together with SBA Form 355, Application for Small Business Size Determination, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any overnight delivery service that provides proof of receipt.

It also offers such loans to affected small businesses to help them recover from economic injury caused by such disasters. SBA also offers interim guaranteed disaster loans, in participation with financial institutions, to affected small businesses (“IDAP loans”).</P><P>(b) Disaster declarations are official notices recognizing that specific geographic areas have been damaged by floods and other acts of nature, riots, civil disorders, or industrial accidents such as oil spills. These disasters are sudden events which cause severe physical damage, and do not include slower physical occurrences such as shoreline erosion or gradual land settling. However, for purposes of economic injury disaster loans only, they do include droughts and below average water levels in the Great Lakes or on any body of water in the United States that supports commerce by small businesses. Sudden events that cause substantial economic injury may be disasters even if they do not cause physical damage to a survivor's property. Past examples include ocean conditions causing significant displacement (major ocean currents) or closure (toxic algae blooms) of customary fishing waters, as well as contamination of food or other products for human consumption from unforeseeable and unintended events beyond the control of the survivors.</P><CITA TYPE="N">[89 FR 91538, Nov. 20, 2024]</CITA></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 123.3" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.18.1.273.3" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 123.3 How are disaster declarations made?</HEAD><P>(a) There are seven ways in which disaster declarations are issued which make SBA disaster loans possible:</P><P>(1) The President declares a Major Disaster and authorizes Federal Assistance, including individual assistance (Assistance to Individuals and Households Program).</P><P>(2) If the President declares a Major Disaster limited to public assistance only, a private nonprofit facility which provides non-critical services under guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must first apply to SBA for disaster loan assistance for such non-critical services before it could seek grant assistance from FEMA.</P><P>(3) SBA makes a physical disaster declaration, based on the occurrence of at least a minimum amount of physical damage to buildings, machinery, equipment, inventory, homes and other property. Such damage usually must meet the following tests:</P><P>(i) In any county or other smaller political subdivision of a State or U.S. territory, at least 25 homes or 25 businesses, or a combination of at least 25 homes, businesses, or other eligible institutions, each sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower; or</P><P>(ii) In any such political subdivision, at least three businesses each sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower, and, as a direct result of such physical damage, 25 percent or more of the work force in their community would be unemployed for at least 90 days; and</P><P>(iii) The Governor of the State or the Chief Executive of the Indian Tribal government in which the disaster occurred submits a written request to SBA for a physical disaster declaration by SBA. This request should be delivered to the Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center serving the jurisdiction within 60 days of the date of the disaster.</P><P>(4) SBA makes an economic injury disaster declaration in response to a determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture.</P><P>(5) SBA makes an economic injury declaration in reliance on a state certification that at least five small business concerns in a disaster area have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the disaster and are in need of financial assistance not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The state certification must be signed by the Governor, must specify the county or counties or other political subdivision in which the disaster occurred, and should be delivered (with supporting documentation) to the Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center serving the jurisdiction within 120 days of the disaster occurrence. When a Governor certifies with respect to a drought or to below average water levels, the supporting documentation must include findings which show that conditions during the incident period meet or exceed the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) standard of “severe” (Intensity level D-2 to D-4). The USDM may be found at<I>https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/.</I></P><P>(6) SBA makes a physical disaster declaration in a rural area (rural disaster declaration) upon request from the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive of the Indian Tribal government in which the rural area is located. Rural area means any county or other political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States that is designated as a rural area by the Bureau of the Census. The following conditions must be met:</P><P>(i) The President has declared a Major Disaster for the rural area, but has not authorized individual assistance; and</P><P>(ii) Any home, small business concern, private nonprofit organization, or small agricultural cooperative in the rural area has incurred significant damage.

Only those survivors located in the declared disaster area are eligible to apply for SBA disaster loans.

In major disasters, economic injury disaster loans and IDAP loans may be made for survivors in contiguous counties or other political subdivisions, provided, however that with respect to major disasters which authorize public assistance only, SBA shall not make economic injury disaster or IDAP loans in counties contiguous to the disaster area. Except for rural disaster declarations (as defined in § 123.3), disaster declarations issued by SBA include contiguous counties for both physical, economic injury and, in some cases IDAP assistance. Rural disaster declarations do not include assistance for contiguous counties. Contiguous counties or other political subdivisions are those land areas which abut the land area of the declared disaster area without geographic separation other than by a minor body of water, not to exceed five miles between the land areas of such counties. The individual islands of geographically isolated island chains, including Hawai'i, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, are also designated as contiguous to each other.

In determining whether a concern applying to be certified for the 8(a) BD program qualifies as a small business concern under the size standard corresponding to its primary industry classification, SBA will accept the concern's size representation in the System for Award Management (SAM), or successor system, unless there is evidence indicating that the concern is other than small.

A Participant must notify SBA within 30 calendar days if the compensation paid to the highest-ranking officer of the Participant falls below that paid to a non-disadvantaged individual.

SBA may also consider access by the Participant firm to a significant new source of capital or loans since the financial condition of the Participant is considered in evaluating the disadvantaged individual's economic status.</P><P>(d)<I>Excessive withdrawals.</I></P><P>(2) If SBA determines that funds or assets have been excessively withdrawn from the Participant for the personal benefit of one or more owners or managers, or any person or entity affiliated with such owners or managers, and such withdrawal was detrimental to the achievement of the targets, objectives, and goals contained in the Participant's business plan, SBA may:</P><P>(i) Initiate termination proceedings under §§ 124.303 and 124.304 where the withdrawals detrimentally affect the achievement of the Participant's targets, objectives and goals set forth in its business plan, or its overall business development;</P><P>(ii) Initiate early graduation proceedings under §§ 124.302 and 124.303 where the withdrawals do not adversely affect the Participant's business development; or</P><P>(iii) Require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets, as well as any other actions SBA deems necessary to counteract the detrimental effects of the withdrawals, as a condition of the Participant maintaining program eligibility.</P><P>(3) Withdrawals are excessive if in the aggregate during any fiscal year of the Participant they exceed (i) $250,000 for firms with sales up to $1,000,000; (ii) $300,000 for firms with sales between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000; and (iii) $400,000 for firms with sales exceeding $2,000,000.</P><P>(4) The fact that a concern's net worth has increased despite withdrawals that are deemed excessive will not preclude SBA from determining that such withdrawals were detrimental to the attainment of the concern's business objectives or to its overall business development.</P><P>(5) The excessive withdrawal analysis does not apply to Participants owned by Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs where a withdrawal is made for the benefit of the Tribe, ANC, NHO, CDC or the native or shareholder community. It does, however, apply to withdrawals from a firm owned by a Tribe, ANC, NHO, or CDC that do not benefit the relevant entity or community. Thus, if funds or assets are withdrawn from an entity-owned Participant for the benefit of a non-disadvantaged manager or owner that exceed the withdrawal thresholds, SBA may find that withdrawal to be excessive. However, a non-disadvantaged minority owner may receive a payout in excess of the excessive withdrawal amount if it is a pro rata distribution paid to all shareholders (<I>i.e.,</I></P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (d)(5).</HED><PSPACE>Tribally-owned Participant X pays $1,000,000 to a non-disadvantaged manager. If that was not part of a pro rata distribution to all shareholders, that would be deemed an excessive withdrawal.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 2 to paragraph (d)(5).</HED><PSPACE>ANC-owned Participant Y seeks to distribute $550,000 to the ANC and $450,000 to non-disadvantaged individual A based on their 55%/45% ownership interests. Because the distribution is based on the pro rata share of ownership, this would not be prohibited as an excessive withdrawal unless SBA determined that Y would be adversely affected.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><P>(e)<I>Change in primary industry classification.</I></P><P>(2) SBA may change the primary industry classification contained in a Participant's business plan where the greatest portion of the Participant's total revenues during the Participant's last three completed fiscal years has evolved from one NAICS code to another. As part of its annual review, SBA will consider whether the primary NAICS code contained in a Participant's business plan continues to be appropriate.</P><P>(i) Where SBA believes that the primary industry classification contained in a Participant's business plan does not match the Participant's actual revenues over the Participant's most recently completed three fiscal years, SBA may notify the Participant of its intent to change the Participant's primary industry classification and afford the Participant the opportunity to respond.</P><P>(ii) A Participant may challenge SBA's intent to change its primary industry classification by demonstrating why it believes the primary industry classification contained in its business plan continues to be appropriate, despite an increase in revenues in a secondary NAICS code beyond those received in its designated primary industry classification. The Participant should identify: All non-federal work that it has performed in its primary NAICS code; any efforts it has made and any plans it has to make to receive contracts to obtain contracts in its primary NAICS code; all contracts that it was awarded that it believes could have been classified under its primary NAICS code, but which a contracting officer assigned another reasonable NAICS code; and any other information that it believes has a bearing on why its primary NAICS code should not be changed despite performing more work in another NAICS code.</P><P>(iii) As long as the Participant provides a reasonable explanation as to why the identified primary NAICS code continues to be its primary NAICS code, SBA will not change the Participant's primary NAICS code.</P><P>(iv) A Participant may appeal a district office's decision to change its primary NAICS code to SBA's Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law (AGC/PL) within 10 business days of receiving the district office's final determination. The AGC/PL will examine the record, including all information submitted by the Participant in support of its position as to why the primary NAICS code contained in its business plan continues to be appropriate despite performing more work in another NAICS code, and issue a final agency decision within 15 business days of receiving the appeal.</P><P>(v) Where an SBA change in the primary NAICS code of an entity-owned firm results in the entity having two Participants with the same primary NAICS code, the second, newer Participant will not be able to receive any 8(a) contracts in the six-digit NAICS code that is the primary NAICS code of the first, older Participant for a period of time equal to two years after the first Participant leaves the 8(a) BD program.</P><P>(f)<I>Graduation determination.</I></P><CITA TYPE="N">[63 FR 35739, June 30, 1998, as amended at 76 FR 8257, Feb. 11, 2011; 77 FR 28237, May 14, 2012; 81 FR 48581, July 25, 2016; 81 FR 71983, Oct. 19, 2016; 85 FR 66185, Oct. 16, 2020]</CITA></DIV8></DIV7><DIV7 N="283" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.19.1.283" TYPE="SUBJGRP"><HEAD>Applying to the 8(<E T="01">a</E></HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 124.201" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.19.1.283.16" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 124.201 May any business submit an application?</HEAD><P>Any concern or any individual on behalf of a business has the right to apply for 8(a) BD program participation whether or not there is an appearance of eligibility.</P></DIV8><DIV8 N="§ 124.202" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.19.1.283.17" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 124.202 How must an application be filed?</HEAD><P>An application for 8(a) BD program admission must be filed in an electronic format.

This includes set-asides, partial set-asides and reserves of Multiple Award Contracts and set-asides of orders issued against Multiple Award Contracts. Where practicable, simplified acquisition procedures should be used for 8(a) contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. Where appropriate, SBA will delegate the contract execution function to procuring activities. In order to receive and retain a delegation of SBA's contract execution and review functions, a procuring activity must report all 8(a) contract awards, modifications, and options to SBA.</P><P>(b) 8(a) contracts may either be sole source awards or awards won through competition with other Participants. In addition, for multiple award contracts not set aside for the 8(a) BD program, a procuring agency may award an 8(a) sole source order or set aside one or more specific orders to be competed only among eligible 8(a) Participants. Such an order may be awarded as an 8(a) award where the order was offered to and accepted by SBA as an 8(a) award and the order specifies that the performance of work and/or non-manufacturer rule requirements apply as appropriate. A procuring activity cannot restrict an 8(a) competition (for either a contract or order) to require SBA socioeconomic certifications other than 8(a) certification (<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>(c) Admission into the 8(a) BD program does not guarantee that a Participant will receive 8(a) contracts.</P><P>(d) A requirement for possible award may be identified by SBA, a particular Participant or the procuring activity itself.

SBA will determine eligibility at the time of its acceptance of the underlying requirement into the 8(a) BD program for a sole source 8(a) contract, and after the apparent successful offeror is identified for a competitive 8(a) contract. Where a joint venture is the apparent successful offeror in connection with a competitive 8(a) procurement or is offered a sole source order under a previously competitively awarded 8(a) multiple award contract, SBA will determine whether the 8(a) partner to the joint venture is eligible for award, but will not review the joint venture agreement to determine compliance with § 124. 513 (<I>see</I></P><P>(1) Qualifies as a small business under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the requirement;</P><P>(2) Is in compliance with any applicable competitive business mix targets established or remedial measure imposed by § 124.509 that does not include the denial of future sole source 8(a) contracts;</P><P>(3) Complies with the continued eligibility reporting requirements set forth in § 124.112(b);</P><P>(4) Has a bona fide place of business in the applicable geographic area if the procurement is for construction;</P><P>(5) Has not received 8(a) contracts in excess of the dollar limits set forth in § 124.519 for a sole source 8(a) procurement;</P><P>(6) Has complied with the provisions of § 124.513(c) and (d) if it is seeking a sole source 8(a) award through a joint venture; and</P><P>(7) Can demonstrate that it, together with any similarly situated entity, will meet the limitations on subcontracting provisions set forth in § 124.510.</P><P>(h) For a sole source 8(a) procurement, a concern must be a current Participant in the 8(a) BD program at the time of award and must qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract or order on the date the contract or order is offered to the 8(a) BD program. If a firm's term of participation in the 8(a) BD program ends (or the firm otherwise exits the program) before a sole source 8(a) contract can be awarded, award cannot be made to that firm. This applies equally to sole source orders issued under multiple award contracts. For a competitive 8(a) procurement, a firm must be a current Participant eligible for award of the contract on the initial date specified for receipt of offers contained in the solicitation as provided in § 124.507(d).</P><P>(i) A Participant must certify that it qualifies as a small business under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to each 8(a) contract. 8(a) BD program personnel will verify size prior to award of an 8(a) contract. If the Participant is not verified as small, it may request a formal size determination from the appropriate General Contracting Area Office under part 121 of this title.</P><P>(j) Any person or entity that misrepresents its status as a “small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals” in order to obtain any 8(a) contracting opportunity will be subject to possible criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including those imposed by section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d).</P><P>(k) In order to be awarded a sole source or competitive 8(a) construction contract, a Participant must have a bona fide place of business within the applicable geographic location determined by SBA. This will generally be the geographic area serviced by the SBA district office, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a contiguous county (whether in the same or different state), or the geographical area serviced by a contiguous SBA district office to where the work will be performed. A Participant with a bona fide place of business within a state will be deemed eligible for a construction contract anywhere in that state (even if that state is serviced by more than one SBA district office). SBA may also determine that a Participant with a bona fide place of business in the geographic area served by one of several SBA district offices or another nearby area is eligible for the award of an 8(a) construction contract.</P><P>(1) A Participant may have bona fide places of business in more than one location.</P><P>(2) In order for a Participant to establish a bona fide place of business in a particular geographic location, the SBA district office serving the geographic area of that location must determine if the location in fact qualifies as a bona fide place of business under SBA's requirements.</P><P>(i) A Participant must submit a request for a bona fide business determination to the SBA district office servicing it. Such request may, but need not, relate to a specific 8(a) requirement. In order to apply to a specific competitive 8(a) solicitation, such request must be submitted at least 20 working days before initial offers that include price are due.</P><P>(ii) The servicing district office will immediately forward the request to the SBA district office serving the geographic area of the particular location for processing. Within 10 working days of receipt of the submission, the reviewing district office will conduct a site visit, if practicable. If not practicable, the reviewing district office will contact the Participant within such 10-day period to inform the Participant that the reviewing office has received the request and may ask for additional documentation to support the request.</P><P>(iii) In connection with a specific competitive solicitation, the reviewing office will make a determination whether or not the Participant has a bona fide place of business in its geographical area within 5 working days of a site visit or within 15 working days of its receipt of the request from the servicing district office if a site visit is not practical in that timeframe. If the request is not related to a specific procurement, the reviewing office will make a determination within 30 working days of its receipt of the request from the servicing district office, if practicable.</P><P>(A) Where SBA does not provide a determination within the identified time limit, a Participant may presume that SBA has approved its request for a bona fide place of business and submit an offer for a competitive 8(a) procurement that requires a bona fide place of business in the requested area.</P><P>(B) In order to be eligible for award, SBA must approve the bona fide place of business prior to award. If SBA has not provided a determination prior to the time that a Participant is identified as the apparent successful offeror, SBA will make the bona fide place of business determination as part of the eligibility determination set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this section within 5 days of receiving a procuring activity's request for an eligibility determination, unless the procuring activity grants additional time for review. If, due to deficiencies in a Participant's request, SBA cannot make a determination, and the procuring activity does not grant additional time for review, SBA will be unable to verify the Participant's eligibility for award and the Participant will be ineligible for award.</P><P>(3) The effective date of a bona fide place of business is the date that the evidence (paperwork) shows that the business in fact regularly maintained its business at the new geographic location.</P><P>(4) If a Participant is currently performing a contract in a specific state, it qualifies as having a bona fide place of business in that state for one or more additional contracts. The Participant may not use contract performance in one state to allow it to be eligible for an 8(a) contract in a contiguous state unless it officially establishes a bona fide place of business in the location in which it is currently performing a contract, in the contiguous state or in a location in another state in which the geographical area serviced by the SBA district office is contiguous to the district office in the state where the work will be performed.</P><P>(5) A Participant may establish a bona fide place of business through a full-time employee in a home office.</P><P>(6) An individual designated as the full-time employee of the Participant seeking to establish a bona fide place of business in a specific geographic location need not be a resident of the state where he/she is conducting business.</P><P>(7) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, in order for a Participant to be eligible to submit an offer for an 8(a) procurement limited to a specific geographic area, it must receive from SBA a determination that it has a bona fide place of business within that area prior to submitting its offer for the procurement.</P><P>(8) Once a Participant has established a bona fide place of business, the Participant may change the location of the recognized office without prior SBA approval. However, the Participant must notify SBA and provide documentation demonstrating an office at that new location within 30 days after the move. Failure to timely notify SBA will render the Participant ineligible for new 8(a) construction procurements limited to that geographic area.</P><P>(9) For an 8(a) construction contract requiring work in multiple locations, a Participant is eligible if:</P><P>(i) For a single award contract, the Participant has a bona fide place of business where a majority of the work (as identified by the dollar value of the work) is anticipated to be performed;

Upon receipt of the procuring activity's offer of a procurement requirement, SBA will determine whether it will accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program. SBA's decision whether to accept the requirement will be sent to the procuring activity in writing within 10 business days of receipt of the written offering letter if the contract is valued at more than the simplified acquisition threshold, and within two business days of receipt of the offering letter if the contract is valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, unless SBA requests, and the procuring activity grants, an extension. SBA and the procuring activity may agree to a shorter timeframe for SBA's review under a Partnership Agreement delegating 8(a) contract execution functions to the agency. SBA is not required to accept any particular procurement offered to the 8(a) BD program.</P><P>(1) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a sole source 8(a) procurement, SBA will accept the offer both on behalf of the 8(a) BD program and in support of a specific Participant. As part of its acceptance of a sole source requirement, SBA will determine the eligibility of the Participant identified in the offering letter, using the same analysis set forth in § 124.501(g). Where a procuring agency offers a sole source 8(a) procurement on behalf of a joint venture, SBA will conduct an eligibility review of the lead 8(a) party to the joint venture as part of its acceptance, and will approve the joint venture prior to award pursuant to § 124.513(e).</P><P>(2) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a competitive 8(a) procurement, SBA will accept the offer on behalf of the 8(a) BD program. For a competitive 8(a) procurement, SBA will determine the eligibility of the apparent successful offeror pursuant to § 124.507(b).</P><P>(3) Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a procuring activity, the procuring activity may assume that SBA accepts its offer for the 8(a) program if the procuring activity does not receive a reply to its offer within five days.</P><P>(4) In the case of procurement requirements valued at or below the Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold:</P><P>(i) Where a procuring activity makes an offer to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant and does not receive a reply to its offer within two days, the procuring activity may assume the offer is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract;</P><P>(ii) Where SBA has delegated its 8(a) contract execution functions to an agency through a signed Partnership Agreement, SBA may authorize the procuring activity to award an 8(a) contract below the simplified acquisition threshold without requiring an offer and acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) BD program. However, the procuring activity must request SBA to determine the eligibility of the intended awardee prior to award. SBA shall review the 8(a) Participant's eligibility and issue an eligibility determination within two business days after a request from the procuring activity. If SBA does not respond within this timeframe, the procuring activity may assume the 8(a) Participant is eligible and proceed with award. The procuring activity shall provide a copy of the executed contract to the SBA servicing district office within fifteen business days of award.</P><P>(5) Where SBA does not respond to an offering letter within the normal 10 business-day time period, the procuring activity may seek SBA's acceptance through the AA/BD. The procuring activity may assume that SBA accepts its offer for the 8(a) program if it does not receive a reply from the AA/BD within 5 business days of his or her receipt of the procuring activity request.</P><P>(b)<I>Verification of NAICS code.</I></P><P>(1) SBA will accept the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the procuring activity contracting officer as long as it is reasonable, even though other NAICS codes may also be reasonable.</P><P>(2) If SBA and the procuring activity are unable to agree as to the proper NAICS code designation for the requirement, SBA may either refuse to accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program, appeal the contracting officer's determination to the head of the agency pursuant to § 124.505, or appeal the NAICS code designation to OHA under part 134 of this title.</P><P>(c)<I>Sole source award where procuring activity nominates a specific Participant.</I></P><P>(1) Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on behalf of the Participant recommended by the procuring activity, provided that:</P><P>(i) The procurement is consistent with the Participant's business plan;</P><P>(ii) The Participant complies with its applicable non-8(a) business activity target imposed by § 124.509(d);</P><P>(iii) The Participant is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the procuring activity contracting officer;</P><P>(iv) The Participant has submitted required financial statements to SBA; and</P><P>(v) The Participant can demonstrate that it, together with any similarly situated entity, will meet the limitations on subcontracting provisions set forth in § 124.510.</P><P>(2) If an appropriate match exists, SBA will advise the procuring activity whether SBA will participate in contract negotiations or whether SBA will authorize the procuring activity to negotiate directly with the identified Participant. Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a procuring activity, SBA will also identify that delegation in its acceptance letter.</P><P>(3) If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the Participant and the procuring activity, and may then nominate an alternate Participant.</P><P>(d)<I>Open requirements.</I></P><P>(1) If the procurement is a construction requirement, SBA will examine the portfolio of Participants that have a bona fide place of business within the geographical boundaries served by the SBA district office where the work is to be performed to select a qualified Participant. If none is found to be qualified or a match for a concern in that district is determined to be impossible or inappropriate, SBA may nominate a Participant with a bona fide place of business within the geographical boundaries served by another district office within the same state, or may nominate a Participant having a bona fide place of business out of state but within a reasonable proximity to the work site. SBA's decision will ensure that the nominated Participant is close enough to the work site to keep costs of performance reasonable.</P><P>(2) If the procurement is not a construction requirement, SBA may select any eligible, responsible Participant nationally to perform the contract.</P><P>(3) In cases in which SBA selects a Participant for possible award from among two or more eligible and qualified Participants, the selection will be based upon relevant factors, including business development needs, compliance with competitive business mix requirements (if applicable), financial condition, management ability, technical capability, and whether award will promote the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts.</P><P>(e)<I>Withdrawal/substitution of offered requirement or Participant.</I></P><P>(1) If the procuring agency and SBA agree that another Participant can fulfill its needs, the procuring agency will withdraw the original offering and reoffer the requirement on behalf of another 8(a) Participant. SBA will then accept the requirement on behalf of the newly identified Participant and authorize the procuring agency to negotiate directly with that Participant.</P><P>(2) If the procuring agency and SBA agree that another Participant cannot fulfill its needs, the procuring agency will withdraw the original offering letter and fulfill its needs outside the 8(a) BD program.</P><P>(3) If the procuring agency believes that another Participant cannot fulfill its needs, but SBA does not agree, SBA may appeal that decision to the head of the procuring agency pursuant to § 124.505(a)(2).</P><P>(f)<I>Formal technical evaluations.</I></P><P>(1) Must request that a procurement be a competitive 8(a) award if it requires formal technical evaluations of more than one Participant for a requirement below the applicable competitive threshold amount; and</P><P>(2) May conduct informal assessments of several Participants' capabilities to perform a specific requirement, so long as the statement of work for the requirement is not released to any of the Participants being assessed.</P><P>(g)<I>Repetitive acquisitions.</I></P><P>(1) This enables SBA to determine:</P><P>(i) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;</P><P>(ii) A nominated firm's eligibility, whether or not it is the same firm that performed the previous contract;</P><P>(iii) For open requirements, the effect that contract would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and</P><P>(iv) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) BD program.</P><P>(2) Where a procuring agency seeks to reprocure a follow-on requirement through an 8(a) contracting vehicle which is not available to all 8(a) BD Program Participants (<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>(h)<I>Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) and Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).</I><I>See</I></P><P>(1) SBA will not accept for award on a sole source basis any task order under a BOA or BPA that would cause the total dollar amount of task orders issued to exceed the applicable competitive threshold amount set forth in § 124.506(a).</P><P>(2) Where a procuring activity believes that task orders to be issued under a proposed BOA or BPA will exceed the applicable competitive threshold amount set forth in § 124.506(a), the procuring activity must offer the requirement to the program to be competed among eligible Participants.</P><P>(3) Once a concern's program term expires, the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) BD program, or becomes other than small for the NAICS code assigned under the BOA or BPA, new orders will not be accepted for the concern.</P><P>(4) A procuring agency may offer, and SBA may accept, an order issued under a BOA or BPA to be awarded through the 8(a) BD program where the BOA or BPA itself was not accepted for the 8(a) BD program, but rather was awarded on an unrestricted basis.</P><P>(i)<I>Task or Delivery Order Contracts, including Multiple Award Contracts</I><I>Contracts set-aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) Participants.</I><I>see</I></P><P>(ii) An agency is not required to offer or receive acceptance of individual orders into the 8(a) BD program if the task or delivery order contract or Multiple Award Contract was set-aside exclusively for 8(a) Program Participants, partially set-aside for 8(a) Program Participants or reserved solely for 8(a) Program Participants, and the individual order is to be competed among all 8(a) contract holders. However, where the order includes work that was previously performed through another 8(a) contract, the procuring agency must notify and consult with SBA prior to issuing the order that it intends to procure such specified work through an order under an 8(a) Multiple Award Contract. Consultation with SBA does not require SBA concurrence or approval. Where that work is critical to the business development of a current Participant that previously performed the work through another 8(a) contract and that Participant is not a contract holder of the 8(a) Multiple Award Contract, SBA may request that the procuring agency fulfill the requirement through a competition available to all 8(a) BD Program Participants. SBA will provide any feedback in response to the procuring agency's notification within 10 business days.</P><P>(iii) A concern awarded a task or delivery order contract or Multiple Award Contract that was set-aside exclusively for 8(a) Program Participants, partially set-aside for 8(a) Program Participants or reserved solely for 8(a) Program Participants may generally continue to receive new orders even if it has grown to be other than small or has exited the 8(a) BD program, and agencies may continue to take SDB credit toward their prime contracting goals for orders awarded to 8(a) Participants. A procuring agency may seek to award an order only to a concern that is a current Participant in the 8(a) program at the time of the order. In such a case, the procuring agency will announce its intent to limit the award of the order to current 8(a) Participants and verify a contract holder's 8(a) BD status prior to issuing the order. Where a procuring agency seeks to award an order to a concern that is a current 8(a) Participant, a concern must be an eligible Participant in accordance with § 124.501(g) as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers contained in the order solicitation, or at the date of award of the order if there is no solicitation.</P><P>(iv) An agency may issue a sole source award against a Multiple Award Contract that has been set aside exclusively for 8(a) Program Participants, partially set-aside for 8(a) BD Program Participants or reserved solely for 8(a) Program Participants if the required dollar thresholds for sole source awards are met. Where an agency seeks to award an order on a sole source basis (<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>(A) To be eligible for the award of a sole source order, a concern must be a current Participant in the 8(a) BD program at the time of award of the order, qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the order on the date the order is offered to the 8(a) BD program, and be in compliance with any applicable competitive business mix target established or remedial measure imposed by § 124.509. Where the intended sole source recipient is a joint venture, the 8(a) managing partner to the joint venture is the concern whose eligibility is considered.</P><P>(B) Where an agency seeks to issue a sole source order to a joint venture, the two-year restriction for joint venture awards set forth in § 121.103(h) does not apply and SBA will not review and approve the joint venture agreement as set forth in § 124.513(e)(1).</P><P>(2)<I>Allowing orders issued to 8(a) Participants under Multiple Award Contracts that were not set-aside for exclusive competition among eligible 8(a) Participants to be considered 8(a) awards.</I></P><P>(i) The order must be offered to and accepted into the 8(a) BD program;</P><P>(ii) The order must be either an 8(a) sole source award or be competed exclusively among only the 8(a) awardees of the underlying multiple award contract. Where an agency seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive order under a multiple award contract that was awarded under full and open competition or as a small business set-aside, all eligible 8(a) BD Participants who are contract holders of the underlying multiple award contract must have the opportunity to compete for the order. Where an agency seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive order under the Federal Supply Schedule, an agency can utilize the procedures set forth in FAR subpart 8.4 (48 CFR part 8, subpart 8.4) to award to an eligible 8(a) BD Participant. Where an agency seeks to issue an 8(a) sole source order under a multiple award contract that was awarded under full and open competition or as a small business set-aside, the identified 8(a) Participant that is a contract holder of the underlying multiple award contract must be an eligible Participant on the date of the issuance of the order.</P><P>(iii) The order must require the concern comply with applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (<I>see</I><I>see</I></P><P>(iv) SBA must verify that a concern is an eligible 8(a) Participant in accordance with § 124.501(g) as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers contained in the order solicitation, or at the date of award of the order if there is no solicitation.

In determining compliance, SBA will compare all 8(a) revenues received during the year, including those from options and modifications, to all non-8(a) revenues received during the year.</P><P>(d)<I>Consequences of not meeting competitive business mix targets.</I></P><P>(i) SBA will determine whether the Participant made good faith efforts to attain the targeted non-8(a) revenues during the just completed program year. A Participant may establish that it made good faith efforts by demonstrating to SBA that:</P><P>(A) It submitted offers for one or more non-8(a) procurements which, if awarded to the Participant during its just completed program year, would have given the Participant sufficient revenues to achieve the applicable non-8(a) business activity target during that same program year. In such a case, the Participant must provide copies of offers submitted in response to solicitations and documentary evidence of its projected revenues under these missed contract opportunities; or</P><P>(B) Individual extenuating circumstances adversely impacted its efforts to obtain non-8(a) revenues, including but not limited to a reduction in government funding, continuing resolutions and budget uncertainties, increased competition driving prices down, or having one or more prime contractors award less work to the Participant than originally contemplated. Where available, supporting information and documentation must be included to show how such extenuating circumstances specifically prevented the Participant from attaining its targeted non-8(a) revenues during the just completed program year.</P><P>(ii) In determining the projected revenue SBA should consider in determining whether one or more unsuccessful offers submitted by the Participant would have given the Participant sufficient revenues to achieve the applicable non-8(a) business activity target under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, SBA will consider only the base year of the procurement at issue and not the projected full value of the procurement. SBA will not consider projected revenue under a particular non-8(a) contract where SBA determines the Participant submitted its offer without possessing reasonable prospects of success. In making this determination, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:</P><P>(A) The magnitude of the contract relative to that of the Participant's previous contracts: and</P><P>(B) The past performance and experience of a joint venture partner and/or a subcontractor.</P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (d)(1)(ii):</HED><PSPACE>Participant X is in year 2 of the transitional stage (or year 6 of the 8(a) BD program). It has never received a contract in excess of $5M. X received $20M in total revenue and $3M in non-8(a) revenue during program year 6. X failed to meet its applicable non-8(a) business activity target (BAT) of 25% ($20M × 0.25 = $5M). To demonstrate its good efforts to achieve non-8(a) revenue, X submits evidence that it submitted two offers without any identified subcontractors: one for a five-year contract valued at $100M and one for a five-year contract valued at $5M. SBA would not consider the first offer to qualify as a “good faith effort” and would determine that the offer had no reasonable prospect for success since the magnitude of that contract far exceeded anything it had performed previously (submitting an offer for a $100M contract where the firm had never performed a contract in excess of $5M) and X did not identify any subcontractor or joint venture partner with relevant past performance and experience. The second offer would count as a good faith effort since its overall value was in line with previous contracts X had performed. However, because SBA considers only the projected revenue for the base year of the contract (or $1M), considering this offer does not bring X into compliance with its BAT ($3M + $1M = $4M, which is less than the $5M required to be in compliance).</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><P>(iii) The Participant bears the burden of establishing that it made good faith efforts to meet its non-8(a) business activity target. SBA's determination as to whether a Participant made good faith efforts is final and no appeal may be taken with respect to that decision.</P><P>(2) If SBA determines that an 8(a) Participant has failed to meet its applicable competitive business mix target during any program year in the transitional stage of program participation, SBA will increase its monitoring of the Participant's contracting activity during the ensuing program year.</P><P>(3) As a condition of eligibility for new 8(a) sole source contracts, SBA may require a Participant that fails to achieve the non-8(a) business activity targets to take one or more specific actions. These include requiring the Participant to obtain management assistance, technical assistance, and/or counseling from an SBA resource partner or otherwise, and/or attend seminars relating to management assistance, business development, financing, marketing, accounting, or proposal preparation. Where any such condition is imposed, SBA will not accept a sole source requirement offered to the 8(a) BD program on behalf of the Participant until the Participant demonstrates to SBA that the condition has been met.</P><P>(4) If SBA determines that a Participant has not made good faith efforts to meet its applicable non-8(a) business activity target, the Participant will be ineligible for sole source 8(a) contracts in the current program year. SBA will notify the Participant in writing that the Participant will not be eligible for further 8(a) sole source contract awards until it has demonstrated to SBA that it has complied with its non-8(a) business activity requirements as described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. In order for a Participant to come into compliance with the non-8(a) business activity target and be eligible for further 8(a) sole source contracts, it may:</P><P>(i) Wait until the end of the current program year and demonstrate to SBA as part of the normal annual review process that it has met the revised non-8(a) business activity target; or</P><P>(ii) At its option, submit information regarding its non-8(a) revenue to SBA quarterly throughout the current program year in an attempt to come into compliance before the end of the current program year. If the Participant satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, SBA will reinstate the Participant's ability to get sole source 8(a) contracts prior to its annual review.</P><P>(A) To qualify for reinstatement during the first six months of the current program year (<I>i.e.,</I></P><P>(B) To qualify for reinstatement during the last six months of the current program year (<I>i.e.,</I></P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (d)(4).</HED><PSPACE>Firm A had $10 million in total revenue during year 2 in the transitional stage (year 6 in the program), but failed to meet the minimum non-8(a) business activity target of 25 percent. It had 8(a) revenues of $8.5 million and non-8(a) revenues of $1.5 million (15 percent). Based on total revenues of $10 million, Firm A should have had at least $2.5 million in non-8(a) revenues. Thus, Firm A missed its target by $1 million (its target ($2.5 million) minus its actual non-8(a) revenues ($1.5 million)). Because Firm A did not achieve its non-8(a) business activity target and SBA determined that it did not make good faith efforts to obtain non-8(a) revenue, it cannot receive 8(a) sole source awards until correcting that situation. The firm may wait until the next annual review to establish that it has met the revised target, or it can choose to report contract awards and other non-8(a) revenue to SBA quarterly. Firm A elects to submit information to SBA quarterly in year 3 of the transitional stage (year 7 in the program). In order to be eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts after either its 3 month or 6 month review, Firm A must show that it has received non-8(a) revenue and/or been awarded new non-8(a) contracts totaling $1 million (the amount by which it missed its target in year 2 of the transitional stage).</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 2 to paragraph (d)(4).</HED><PSPACE>Firm B had $10 million in total revenue during year 2 in the transitional stage (year 6 in the program), of which $8.5 million were 8(a) revenues and $1.5 million were non-8(a) revenues, and SBA determined that Firm B did not make good faith efforts to meet its non-8(a) business activity target. At its first two quarterly reviews during year 3 of the transitional stage (year 7 in the program), Firm B could not demonstrate that it had received at least $1 million in non-8(a) revenue and new non-8(a) awards. In order to be eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts after its 9 month or 1 year review, Firm B must show that at least 35% (the non-8(a) business activity target for year 3 in the transitional stage) of all revenues received during year 3 in the transitional stage as of that point are from non-8(a) sources.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 3 to paragraph (d)(4).</HED><PSPACE>Firm C elected to extend its participation in the 8(a) BD program as set forth in § 124.2 of this chapter.

In order to be eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts during year 6 of the transitional stage (year 10 in the program), Firm C must demonstrate at its first or second quarterly review that it had received at least $3.5 million in non-8(a) revenue and new non-8(a) awards (the amount by which it failed to meet the 50% non-8(a) business activity target for year 5 in the transitional stage). If, at its first two quarterly reviews during year 6 of the transitional stage (year 10 in the program), Firm C could not demonstrate that it had received at least $3.5 million in non-8(a) revenue and new non-8(a) awards, Firm C would not be eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts for the remainder of its program term.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><P>(5) In determining whether a Participant has achieved its required non-8(a) business activity target at the end of any program year in the transitional stage, or whether a Participant that failed to meet the target for the previous program year has achieved the required level of non-8(a) business at its nine-month review, SBA will measure 8(a) support by adding the base year value of all 8(a) contracts awarded during the applicable program year to the value of all options and modifications executed during that year.</P><P>(6) SBA may initiate proceedings to terminate a Participant from the 8(a) BD program where the firm makes no good faith efforts to obtain non-8(a) revenues.</P><P>(e)<I>Waiver of sole source prohibition.</I></P><P>(2) SBA may waive the requirement prohibiting a Participant from receiving further sole source 8(a) contracts when the Participant does not meet its non-8(a) business activity target where the head of a procuring activity represents to SBA that award of a sole source 8(a) contract to the Participant is needed to achieve significant interests of the Government.</P><P>(3) The decision to grant or deny a request for a waiver is at SBA's discretion, and no appeal may be taken with respect to that decision.</P><P>(4) A waiver generally applies to a specific sole source opportunity.

The written notification must include the name and location of the apparent successful offeror and if the successful offeror is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business;</P><P>(ix) As a best practice, the contractor may provide the pre-award written notification cited in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section to unsuccessful and small business offerors on subcontracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) and should do so whenever practical;</P><P>(x) Except when subcontracting for commercial products or commercial services, the prime contractor must require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) who receive subcontracts in excess of $1,500,000 in the case of a subcontract for the construction of any public facility, or in excess of $750,000 in the case of all other subcontracts, and which offer further subcontracting possibilities, to adopt a subcontracting plan of their own consistent with this section, and must ensure at a minimum that all subcontractors required to maintain subcontracting plans pursuant to this paragraph will review and approve subcontracting plans submitted by their subcontractors; monitor their subcontractors' compliance with their approved subcontracting plans; ensure that subcontracting reports are submitted by their subcontractors when required; acknowledge receipt of their subcontractors' reports; compare the performance of their subcontractors to their subcontracting plans and goals; and discuss performance with their subcontractors when necessary to ensure their subcontractors make a good-faith effort to comply with their subcontracting plans;</P><P>(xi) The prime contractor must provide a written statement of the types of records it will maintain to demonstrate procedures which have been adopted to ensure subcontractors at all tiers comply with the requirements and goals set forth in the subcontracting plan established in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section, including the establishment of source lists of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, certified small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women; the efforts to identify and award subcontracts to such small business concerns; and size or socioeconomic certifications or representations received in connection with each subcontract;</P><P>(xii) The prime contractor must provide a written statement of the types of records it will maintain to demonstrate that procedures have been adopted to substantiate the subcontracting credit that the prime contractor elects under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section; and</P><P>(xiii)(A) The prime contractor, upon request from a first-tier small business subcontractor, shall provide the subcontractor with a rating of the subcontractor's past performance. The prime contractor must provide the small business subcontractor the requested rating within 15 calendar days of the request. The rating provided by the prime contractor to the first-tier small business subcontractor shall utilize the five-scale ratings system found in FAR 42.1503 (48 CFR 42.1503): Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory. If the subcontractor will use the rating for an offer on a prime contract, it must include, at a minimum, the following evaluation factors in the requested rating:</P><P>(<I>1</I></P><P>(<I>2</I></P><P>(<I>3</I></P><P>(<I>4</I></P><P>(<I>5</I></P><P>(B) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(xii)(A) of this section is not subject to the flow-down in paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section.</P><P>(C) A first-tier small business subcontractor must make the request for a performance rating from the prime contractor within 30 calendar days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government. The prime contractor and the first-tier small business subcontractor may negotiate a later deadline for the request for a performance rating, but in no case can the prime contractor impose a deadline earlier than 30 calendar days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government.</P><P>(D) The rating provided by the prime contractor to the first-tier small business subcontractor shall utilize the five-scale ratings system found in FAR 42.1503 (48 CFR 42.1503): Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.</P><P>(2) A commercial plan, also referred to as an annual plan or company-wide plan, is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services. A commercial plan covers the offeror's fiscal year and applies to all of the commercial products and commercial services sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line). Once approved, the plan remains in effect during the federal fiscal year for all Federal Government contracts in effect during that period. The contracting officer of the agency that originally approved the commercial plan will exercise the functions of the contracting officer on behalf of all agencies that award contracts covered by the plan.</P><P>(3) An offeror must represent to the contracting officer that it will make a good faith effort to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials, or obtain the performance of construction work from the small business concerns that it used in preparing the bid or proposal, in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal. Merely responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or offer. An offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if:</P><P>(i) The offeror references the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan;</P><P>(ii) The offeror has a subcontract or agreement in principle to subcontract with the small business concern to perform a portion of the specific contract; or</P><P>(iii) The small business concern drafted any portion of the bid or proposal or the offeror used the small business concern's pricing or cost information or technical expertise in preparing the bid or proposal, where there is written evidence (including email) of an intent or understanding that the small business concern will be awarded a subcontract for the related work if the offeror is awarded the contract.</P><P>(4) If a prime contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in (c)(3), the prime contractor must provide the contracting officer with a written explanation. This written explanation must be submitted to the contracting officer prior to the submission of the invoice for final payment and contract close-out.</P><P>(5) A prime contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing if upon completion of the responsibilities of the small business subcontractor (i.e., the subcontractor is entitled to payment under the terms of the subcontract), the prime contractor pays a reduced price to a small business subcontractor for goods and services provided for the contract or the payment to a small business subcontractor is more than 90 days past due under the terms of the subcontract for goods and services provided for the contract and for which the Federal agency has paid the prime contractor. “Reduced price” means a price that is less than the price agreed upon in a written, binding contractual document. The prime contractor shall include the reason for the reduction in payment to or failure to pay a small business subcontractor in any written notice.</P><P>(6) If at the conclusion of a contract the prime contractor did not meet all of the small business subcontracting goals in the subcontracting plan, the prime contractor shall provide the contracting officer with a written explanation as to why it did not meet the goals of the plan so that the contracting officer can evaluate whether the prime contractor acted in good faith as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P><P>(7) The additional prime contractor responsibilities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply if:</P><P>(i) The prime contractor is a small business concern;</P><P>(ii) The prime contract or contract modification is a personal services contract; or</P><P>(iii) The prime contract or contract modification will be performed entirely outside of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P><P>(8) A prime contractor that identifies a small business by name as a subcontractor in a proposal, offer, bid or subcontracting plan must notify those subcontractors in writing prior to identifying the concern in the proposal, bid, offer or subcontracting plan.</P><P>(9) Anyone who has a reasonable basis to believe that a prime contractor or a subcontractor may have made a false statement to an employee or representative of the Federal Government, or to an employee or representative of the prime contractor, with respect to subcontracting plans must report the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General. All other concerns as to whether a prime contractor or subcontractor has complied with SBA regulations or otherwise acted in bad faith may be reported to the Government Contracting Area Office where the firm is headquartered.</P><P>(d)<I>Contracting officer responsibilities.</I></P><P>(1) Ensuring that all contractors submit their subcontracting reports into the eSRS (or any successor system) or, if applicable, the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, within 45 days after the report ending date (e.g., by November 14th for the fiscal year ended September 30th).</P><P>(2) Reviewing all ISRs, and where applicable, SSRs, in eSRS (or any successor system) within 75 days of the report ending date (e.g., by December 14th for a report submitted for the fiscal year ended September 30th) and either accepting or rejecting the reports in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions set forth in 48 CFR subpart 19.7, 52.219-9, and the eSRS instructions (<I>www.esrs.gov</I></P><P>(3) Evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan.</P><P>(i) Evidence that a large business prime contractor has made a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan or other subcontracting responsibilities includes supporting documentation that:</P><P>(A) The contractor performed one or more of the actions described in paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate for the procurement;</P><P>(B) Although the contractor may have failed to achieve its goal in one socioeconomic category, it over-achieved its goal by an equal or greater amount in one or more of the other categories;

However, since achievements must be reported on the ISR (or the SF-294, if applicable) on a cumulative basis from the inception of the contract, the contractor's achievements prior to the modification or option will be factored into its overall achievement on the contract from inception.</P><P>(11) Evaluating whether the contractor or subcontractor complied in good faith with the requirement to provide periodic reports and cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required by the Federal agency or the Administration in order to determine the extent of compliance by the contractor or subcontractor with the subcontracting plan. The contractor or subcontractor's failure to comply with this requirement in good faith shall be a material breach of such contract or subcontract and may be considered in any past performance evaluation of the contractor.</P><P>(e)<I>CMR Responsibilities.</I></P><P>(1) Facilitating the matching of large prime contractors with small business concerns;</P><P>(2) Counseling large prime contractors on their responsibilities to maximize subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns;</P><P>(3) Instructing large prime contractors on identifying small business concerns by means of SAM (or any successor system), SUB-Net, Business Matchmaking events, and other resources and tools;</P><P>(4) Counseling small business concerns on how to market themselves to large prime contractors;</P><P>(5) Maintaining a portfolio of large prime contractors and conducting Subcontracting Orientation and Assistance Reviews (SOARs). SOARs are conducted for the purpose of assisting prime contractors in understanding and complying with their small business subcontracting responsibilities, including developing subcontracting goals that reflect maximum practicable opportunity for small business; maintaining acceptable books and records; and periodically submitting reports to the Federal government; and</P><P>(6) Conducting periodic reviews, including compliance reviews in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P><P>(f)<I>Compliance reviews.</I></P><P>(2) All compliance reviews begin with a validation of the prime contractor's most recent ISR (or SF-294, if applicable) or SSR. A compliance review includes:</P><P>(i) An evaluation of whether the prime contractor assigned the proper NAICS code and corresponding size standard to a subcontract, and a review of whether small business subcontractors qualify for the size or socioeconomic status claimed;</P><P>(ii) Validation of the prime contractor's methodology for completing its subcontracting reports; and</P><P>(iii) Consideration of whether the prime contractor is monitoring its other than small subcontractors with regard to their subcontracting plans, determining achievement of their proposed subcontracting goals, and reviewing their subcontractors' ISRs (or SF-294s, if applicable).</P><P>(3) Upon completion of the review and evaluation of a contractor's performance and efforts to achieve the requirements in its subcontracting plans, the contractor's performance will be assigned one of the following ratings: Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. The factors listed in paragraph (c) of this section will be taken into consideration, where applicable, in determining the contractor's rating. However, a contractor may be found Unsatisfactory, regardless of other factors, if it cannot substantiate the claimed achievements under its subcontracting plan.</P><P>(4) Any contractor that receives a marginal or unsatisfactory rating must provide a written corrective action plan to SBA, or to both SBA and the agency that conducted the compliance review if the agency conducting the review has an agreement with SBA, within 30 days of its receipt of the official compliance report.</P><P>(5) Any contractor that fails to comply with paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or any contractor that fails to demonstrate a good-faith effort, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section:</P><P>(i) May be considered for liquidated damages under the procedures in 48 CFR 19.705-7 and the clause at 52.219-16; and</P><P>(ii) Shall be in material breach of such contract or subcontract, and such failure to demonstrate good faith must be considered in any past performance evaluation of the contractor. This action shall be considered by the contracting officer upon receipt of a written recommendation to that effect from the CMR. The CMR's recommendation must include a copy of the compliance report and any other relevant correspondence or supporting documentation. Furthermore, if the CMR has a reasonable basis to believe that a contractor has made a false statement to an employee or representative of the Federal Government, or to an employee or representative of the prime contractor, the CMR must report the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General. All other concerns as to whether a prime contractor or subcontractor has complied with SBA regulations or otherwise acted in bad faith may be reported to the Area Government Contracting Office where the firm is headquartered.</P><P>(6) Reviews and evaluations of contractors with commercial plans are identical to reviews and evaluations of other contractors, except that contractors with commercial subcontracting plans do not submit the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts. Instead, goal achievement is determined by comparing the goals in the approved commercial subcontracting plan against the cumulative achievements on the SF-295, Summary Subcontract Report, for the same period. The same ratings criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section apply to contractors with commercial plans.</P><P>(7) SBA is authorized to enter into agreements with other Federal agencies or entities to conduct compliance reviews and otherwise further the objectives of the subcontracting program.

As such, as long as the value of the items to be supplied by domestic small business manufacturers or processors plus the value of the items to be supplied that are subject to a waiver account for at least 50% of the value of the contract, the limitations on subcontracting requirement is met.</P><P>(C) For a multiple item procurement, the same small business concern may act as both a manufacturer and a nonmanufacturer.</P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (a)(2).</HED><PSPACE>A contract calls for the supply of one item valued at $1,000,000.

Since 100% of the value of the contract can be procured through domestic small business manufacturers or processors plus manufacturers or processors of the item for which a waiver has been granted, the procurement should be set aside for small business. At least 50% of the value of the contract, or 50% of $1,000,000, must be supplied by one or more domestic small business manufacturers or manufacturers or processors of the one item for which class waiver has been granted.

There are no class waivers subject to the remaining seven items. In order for this procurement to be set aside for small business, a contracting officer must seek and be granted a contract specific waiver for one or more items totaling $200,000 (so that $300,000 plus $200,000 equals 50% of the value of the entire procurement). Once a contract specific waiver is received for one or more items, at least 50% of the value of the contract, or 50% of $1,000,000, must be supplied by one or more domestic small business manufacturers or processors or by manufacturers or processors of the items for which a contract specific waiver has been granted.

SBA will not approve a mentor-protégé relationship in a secondary NAICS code in which the small business concern has no prior experience. SBA may approve a mentor-protégé relationship where the small business concern can demonstrate that it has performed work in one or more similar NAICS codes or where the NAICS code in which the small business concern seeks a mentor-protégé relationship is a logical business progression to work previously performed by the concern.</P><P>(2) A protégé firm may generally have only one mentor at a time.</P><P>(i) SBA may approve a second mentor for a particular protégé firm where the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-protégé relationship, and:</P><P>(A) The second relationship pertains to an unrelated NAICS code; or</P><P>(B) The protégé firm is seeking to acquire a specific expertise that the first mentor does not possess.</P><P>(ii) Where SBA has approved two mentor-protégé relationships for the same protégé small business, the protégé may enter joint venture relationships with each of its two mentors. However, those joint ventures cannot compete against each other and cannot be contract holders on the same multiple award contract.</P><P>(3) SBA may authorize a small business to be both a protégé and a mentor at the same time where the small business can demonstrate that the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-protégé relationship.</P><P>(4) A protégé may generally have a total of two mentor-protégé agreements with different mentors.</P><P>(i) Each mentor-protégé agreement may last for no more than six years, as set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</P><P>(ii) If a mentor-protégé agreement is terminated within 18 months from the date SBA approved the agreement, that mentor-protégé relationship will generally not count as one of the two mentor-protégé relationships that a small business may enter as a protégé. However, where a specific small business protégé appears to enter into many short-term mentor-protégé relationships as a means of extending its program eligibility as a protégé, SBA may determine that the business concern has exhausted its participation in the mentor-protégé program and not approve an additional mentor-protégé relationship.</P><P>(iii) If during the evaluation of the mentor-protégé relationship pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section SBA determines that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-protégé agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided was not satisfactory, SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé relationship. Where SBA or the parties themselves terminate a mentor-protégé relationship, SBA may allow the protégé to substitute another mentor for the time remaining in the mentor-protégé agreement without counting against the two-mentor limit.</P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example to paragraph (c)(4)(iii):</HED><PSPACE>8(a) Participant X enters an SBA approved mentor-protégé relationship with A.

Once SBA determines that the mentor-protégé agreement meets all of SBA's requirements, SBA will approve the X-B relationship for a period of 3 years from the date of SBA's approval. The time searching for a new mentor and SBA's review time are not subtracted from the time authorized for the substituted mentor-protégé relationship.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><P>(iv) Instead of having a six-year mentor-protégé relationship with two separate mentors, a protégé may seek to extend or renew a mentor-protégé relationship with the same mentor for a second six-year term. In order for SBA to approve an extension or renewal of a mentor-protégé relationship with the same mentor, the mentor must commit to providing additional business development assistance to the protégé. Whether a protégé has a mentor-protégé relationship with two different mentors or the same mentor for a second six-year period, a concern cannot be a protégé for a total of more than 12 years.</P><P>(5) Where a business concern purchases another business concern that is currently the mentor of a protégé firm, that business concern shall become the new mentor of the protégé if it commits to honoring the obligations under the seller's mentor-protégé agreement or the purchasing business concern and the protégé negotiate a new mentor-protégé agreement that SBA approves. Where that occurs, that new mentor-protégé relationship will be effective for no longer than six years minus the length of the mentor-protégé relationship with the seller mentor.</P><P>(i) The protégé firm can terminate its mentor-protégé relationship only if the purchasing business concern and the protégé firm cannot agree on either continuing with the previous mentor-protégé agreement or negotiating a new mentor-protégé agreement that is acceptable to SBA.</P><P>(ii) Where a mentor-protégé relationship is terminated, the protégé firm may seek another business concern to enter a mentor-protégé relationship for a duration not to exceed six years minus the length of the mentor-protégé relationship with the former mentor.</P><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 1 to paragraph (c)(5):</HED><PSPACE>Participant A enters a mentor-protégé relationship with business concern X.

The mentor-protégé relationship between A and Y can last no longer than 3 years (6 years minus the length of the A and X mentor-protégé relationship). At the end of that agreement A and Y could seek to renew the mentor-protégé relationship for another 6 years if this is A's first mentor-protégé relationship.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE><EXAMPLE><HED>Example 2 to paragraph (c)(5):</HED><PSPACE>8(a) Participant Z enters a mentor-protégé relationship with business concern B.

If either C is unwilling to abide by the terms of the Z-B mentor-protégé agreement or Z does not want to extend a mentor protégé relationship with C and the mentor-protégé agreement is terminated, Z may seek a new business concern to enter a mentor-protégé relationship. If business concern D agrees to enter into a mentor-protégé relationship with Z and SBA approves that relationship, the Z-D mentor-protégé relationship can last for no longer than 3 years (6 years minus the length of the Z/B mentor-protégé relationship). If that was Z's first mentor-protégé relationship, Z may seek to extend the Z-D mentor-protégé relationship for an additional 6 years or may seek a new mentor-protégé relationship with another firm for up to 6 years.

Once a protégé firm no longer qualifies as a small business for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code under which SBA approved its mentor-protégé relationship, any joint venture between the protégé and its mentor will no longer be able to seek additional contracts or subcontracts as a small business for any NAICS code having the same or lower size standard. A joint venture between a protégé and its mentor could seek additional contract opportunities in NAICS codes having a size standard for which the protégé continues to qualify as small. A change in the protégé's size status does not generally affect contracts previously awarded to a joint venture between the protégé and its mentor.</P><P>(A) Except for contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), a contract awarded to a joint venture between a protégé and a mentor as a small business continues to qualify as an award to small business for the life of that contract and the joint venture remains obligated to continue performance on that contract.</P><P>(B) For contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), where size re-certification is required under § 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option thereafter, once the protégé no longer qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, the joint venture will not be able re-certify itself to be a small business for that contract. The rules set forth in § 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter apply in such circumstances.</P><P>(iv) Where a mentor seeks to sell its interest in a mentor-protégé joint venture, the protégé firm shall have a right of first refusal to purchase that interest. SBA will not find affiliation where a protégé obtains financing under normal commercial terms in order to purchase the mentor's interest in a mentor-protégé joint venture.</P><P>(2) In order to raise capital, the protégé firm may agree to sell or otherwise convey to the mentor an equity interest of up to 40% in the protégé firm.</P><P>(3) Notwithstanding the mentor-protégé relationship, a protégé firm may qualify for other assistance as a small business, including SBA financial assistance.</P><P>(4) No determination of affiliation or control may be found between a protégé firm and its mentor based solely on the mentor-protégé agreement or any assistance provided pursuant to the agreement. However, affiliation may be found for other reasons set forth in § 121.103 of this chapter.</P><P>(5) Where appropriate, procuring activities may provide incentives in the contract evaluation process to a firm that will provide significant subcontracting work to its SBA-approved protégé firm.</P><P>(6) A mentor that provides a subcontract to its protégé that is a covered territory business, or that has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may:</P><P>(i) receive positive consideration for the mentor's past performance evaluation, and (ii) apply costs incurred for providing training to such protege toward the subcontracting goals contained in the subcontracting plan of the mentor.</P><P>(ii) [Reserved]</P><P>(e)<I>Written agreement.</I><I>e.g.,</I></P><P>(i) Specifically identify the business development assistance to be provided and address how the assistance will help the protégé enhance its growth and/or foster or acquire needed capabilities;</P><P>(ii) Identify the specific entity or entities that will provide assistance to or participate in joint ventures with the protégé where the mentor is a parent or subsidiary concern;</P><P>(iii) Establish a single point of contact in the mentor concern who is responsible for managing and implementing the mentor-protégé agreement; and</P><P>(iv) Provide that the mentor will provide such assistance to the protégé firm for at least one year.</P><P>(2) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a protégé must identify any other mentor-protégé relationship it has through another federal agency or SBA and provide a copy of each such mentor-protégé agreement to SBA.</P><P>(i) The small business mentor-protégé agreement must identify how the assistance to be provided by the proposed mentor is different from assistance provided to the protégé through another mentor-protégé relationship, either with the same or a different mentor.</P><P>(ii) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a protégé may terminate a mentor-protégé relationship it has through another agency and use any not yet provided assistance identified in the other mentor-protégé agreement as part of the assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-protégé relationship. Any assistance that has already been provided through another mentor-protégé relationship cannot be identified as assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-protégé relationship.</P><P>(3) The written agreement must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Business Development (AA/BD) or his/her designee. The agreement will not be approved if SBA determines that the assistance to be provided is not sufficient to promote any real developmental gains to the protégé, or if SBA determines that the agreement is merely a vehicle to enable the mentor to receive small business contracts.</P><P>(4) The agreement must provide that either the protégé or the mentor may terminate the agreement with 30 days advance notice to the other party to the mentor-protégé relationship and to SBA.</P><P>(5) The term of a mentor-protégé agreement may not exceed six years. If an initial mentor-protégé agreement is for less than six years, it may be extended by mutual agreement prior to the expiration date for an additional amount of time that would total no more than six years from its inception (<I>e.g.,</I></P><P>(6) SBA must approve all changes to a mentor-protégé agreement in advance, and any changes made to the agreement must be provided in writing. If the parties to the mentor-protégé relationship change the mentor-protégé agreement without prior approval by SBA, SBA shall terminate the mentor-protégé relationship and may also propose suspension or debarment of one or both of the firms pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section where appropriate.</P><P>(7) If control of the mentor changes (through a stock sale or otherwise), the previously approved mentor-protégé relationship may continue provided that, after the change in control, the mentor expresses in writing to SBA that it acknowledges the mentor-protégéagreement and certifies that it will continue to abide by its terms.</P><P>(8) SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé agreement at any time if it determines that the protégé is not benefiting from the relationship or that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the mentor protégé agreement.

Bid 3 (from a HUBZone small business concern) is $1.04/pound for 20,000 pounds. Bid 3 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for 20,000 pounds, since 20,000 is less than 25% of 100,000 pounds. With the 10% price evaluation adjustment, Bid 1 changes from $20,000 for the first 20,000 pounds to $22,000. Bid 3's price of $20,800 ($1.04 × 20,000) is now lower than any other bid for 20,000 pounds. Thus, Bid 3 will be accepted for the full 20,000 pounds. Bid 2 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for that amount of its bid when added to the volume in Bid 3 that does not exceed 25% of the total volume being procured. Since 25,000 pounds is 25% of the total volume of wheat under the IFB, and Bid 3 totaled 20,000 pounds, a 10% price evaluation adjustment will be applied to the first 5,000 pounds of Bid 2.

The amount, status, history of the debt, and agency program under which it arose also will be disclosed.</P><P>(d) If you respond to SBA within 60 days from the date of the notice, SBA will not disclose the information to consumer reporting agencies until it considers your response and determines that you owe a past-due, legally enforceable debt.</P><P>(e) Within 60 days of the notice you may present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable.</P><P>(1) Where a salary offset or administrative offset is proposed, you will have the opportunity to present your evidence to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (“OHA”). The rules in part 134 of this title govern the procedural rights to which you are entitled. In order to have a hearing before OHA, you must request a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the written notice described in this section. An OHA judge will issue a decision within 60 days of the date you filed your petition/request for a review or hearing with OHA, unless you were granted additional time within which to file your request for review.</P><P>(2) Where an income tax refund offset is proposed, you will have the opportunity to request a review and present your evidence to the appropriate SBA Commercial Loan Servicing Center at the address provided in the notice.</P><P>(f) SBA must consider any evidence you present and must first decide that a debt is past due and legally enforceable. A debt is legally enforceable if there is any forum, including a State or Federal Court or administrative agency, in which SBA's claim would not be barred on the date of offset. Non-judgment debts are enforceable for ten years; judgment debts are enforceable beyond ten years. You will be notified of SBA's decision at least 30 days before any offset deduction is made. You also will be notified of the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the deductions, as well as any obligation to pay interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</P><P>(g) If there is any substantial change in the status or amount of your debt, SBA will promptly report that change to each consumer reporting agency it originally contacted.</P><P>(h) SBA will obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the consumer reporting agency has complied with all federal laws relating to provision of consumer credit information.</P><P>(i) If your debt is being repaid by reduction of your income tax refund and you make any additional payments to SBA, SBA will notify the IRS of these payments and your new balance within 10 business days of receiving your payment.</P><P>(j) When the debt of a federal employee is reduced to court judgment, the employee is not entitled to further review by SBA, but is only entitled to notice of a proposed salary offset resulting from the judgment. The amount deducted may not exceed 15% of disposable pay, except when the deduction of a greater amount is necessary to completely collect the debt within the employee's remaining period of employment.</P><P>(k) When another federal agency asks SBA to offset a debt for it, SBA will not initiate the requested offset until it has received from the creditor agency a written certification that the debtor owes a debt, its amount, and that the provisions of all applicable statutes and regulations have been complied with fully.</P><P>(l) SBA may make an offset prior to completion of the procedures described in this part, if:</P><P>(1) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the government's ability to collect the debt; and</P><P>(2) The time before the payment would otherwise be made to you does not reasonably permit the completion of the procedures.</P><P>(3) Such prior offset then must be followed by the completion of the procedures described in this part.</P><P>(m) Where an IRS tax refund offset is sought, SBA must follow the Department of the Treasury's regulations governing offset of a past-due, legally enforceable debt against tax overpayment.</P></DIV8></DIV6><DIV6 N="C" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.29.3" TYPE="SUBPART"><HEAD>Subpart C—Administrative Wage Garnishment</HEAD><DIV8 N="§ 140.11" NODE="13:1.0.1.1.29.3.291.1" TYPE="SECTION"><HEAD>§ 140.11 What type of debt is subject to administrative wage garnishment, and how can SBA administratively garnish your pay?</HEAD><P>(a)<I>General.</I></P><P>(b)<I>Scope.</I></P><P>(2) This section applies despite any State law.</P><P>(3) Nothing in this section prevents SBA from settling for less than the full amount of a debt.
