(1) Under a condition identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a Federal agency may exempt an applicant or recipient of Federal financial assistance from the requirement to obtain a UEI, register in SAM.gov, or both.\n\n(i) If a Federal agency grants an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Federal agency must use a generic entity identifier in the data it reports to USAspending.gov if reporting for a prime award of Federal financial assistance to the recipient is required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended, hereafter cited as “Transparency Act”). Granting an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not impact a Federal agency's responsibility for reporting under the Transparency Act, except that it may use a generic entity identifier in the circumstances described.\n\n(ii) Federal agencies should use generic entity identifiers rarely as it prevents recipients from fulfilling reporting requirements such as subaward or executive compensation reporting required by the Transparency Act.\n\n(2) A Federal agency may exempt an applicant, recipient, or subrecipient when:\n\n(i) The Federal agency determines that it must protect information about the entity from disclosure in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States or to avoid jeopardizing the personal safety of the entity's staff, partners, beneficiaries, and participants;\n\n(ii)(A) All of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The entity is a foreign organization or foreign public entity;\n\n(2) The Federal award or subaward will be performed outside the United States;\n\n(3) The Federal award or subaward will be less than $25,000; and\n\n(4) The Federal agency deems it to be impractical for the entity to comply with the requirements of this part.\n\n(B) The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach;\n\n(iii) For applicants or recipients, the Federal agency may exempt foreign organizations or foreign public entities from completing full registration in SAM.gov for a Federal award less than $500,000 that will be performed outside the United States. Foreign organizations or foreign public entities exempted from registering in SAM.gov under this provision must still obtain a UEI. The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach; or\n\n(iv) For applicants, the Federal agency determines that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a UEI and registering in SAM.gov before receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal agencies must require the recipient to obtain a UEI and complete registration in SAM.gov within 30 days of the Federal award date.\n\n(b) Class exceptions. OMB may approve additional exceptions for classes of Federal awards, applicants, or recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute.",

A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that a Federal agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or any other term.\n\n(b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that does not have an exemption under § 25.110 to:\n\n(1) Be registered in SAM.gov before submitting an application;\n\n(2) Maintain a current and active registration in SAM.gov at all times during which it has an active Federal award as a recipient or an application under consideration by a Federal agency. The applicant or recipient must review and update its information in SAM.gov annually from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates to ensure it is current, accurate, and complete. If applicable, this includes identifying the applicant's or recipient's immediate and highest-level owner and subsidiaries, as well as providing information on all predecessors that have received a Federal award or contract within the last three years; and\n\n(3) Include its UEI in each application it submits to the Federal agency.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this policy, the applicant must meet the Federal agency's eligibility criteria and have the legal authority to apply for and receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a UEI. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal agency program, but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the UEI of the lead applicant must be used.",

Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).\n\n(b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project.

L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements” and OMB Circular A-102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A-102 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/a102.html.\n\n(b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations,” recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) required by OMB Circular A-133. OMB Circular A-133 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html. This shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF-SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix “ARRA-” in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF-SAC.\n\n(c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing program.\n\n(d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.",

The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:\n\n(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.\n\n(b) The frequency of incidents or duration of the wrongdoing.\n\n(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.\n\n(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.\n\n(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not government-wide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.\n\n(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.\n\n(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.\n\n(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.\n\n(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.\n\n(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.\n\n(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.\n\n(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or implemented remedial or protective measures in the form of procedures, policies, and programs to effectively address the activity cited as a basis for the debarment.\n\n(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.\n\n(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.\n\n(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.\n\n(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.\n\n(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.\n\n(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.\n\n(s) Whether your business, technical, or professional license(s) has been suspended, terminated, or revoked.\n\n(t) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.",

          "content": "§ 200.1   Definitions.\nThe following is a list of definitions of key terms frequently used in 2 CFR part 200. Definitions found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply to particular programs take precedence over the following definitions. However, where the following definitions implement specific statutory requirements that apply government-wide, such as the Single Audit Act, the following definitions take precedence over Federal regulations. For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:\n\nAcquisition cost means the (total) cost of the asset including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use. For example, acquisition cost for equipment means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired. Acquisition costs for software include those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Ancillary charges such as taxes, duty, protective in transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in or excluded from the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.\n\nAdvance payment means a payment that a Federal agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism and payment method before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program purposes.\n\nAllocation means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objective(s), in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship. The process may entail assigning a cost(s) directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives.\n\nAssistance Listings refer to the publicly available listing of Federal assistance programs managed and administered by the General Services Administration (GSA) at SAM.gov.\n\nAssistance Listing number means a unique number assigned to identify an Assistance Listing.\n\nAssistance Listing program title means the title that corresponds to the Assistance Listing number.\n\nAudit finding means deficiencies which the auditor is required to report in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. (See § 200.516(a))\n\nAuditee means any non-Federal entity that must be audited under this part. (See § 200.501)\n\nAuditor means an auditor who is a public accountant or a Federal, State, local government, or Indian Tribe audit organization that meets the general standards specified for external auditors in generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). The term auditor does not include internal auditors of nonprofit organizations.\n\nBudget means the financial plan for the Federal award that the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves during the Federal award process or in subsequent amendments to the Federal award. It may include the Federal and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.\n\nBudget period means the time interval from the start date of a funded portion of an award to the end date of that funded portion, during which recipients and subrecipients are authorized to incur financial obligations of the funds awarded, including any funds carried forward or other revisions pursuant to § 200.308.\n\nCapital assets means:\n\n(1) Tangible or intangible assets used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which are capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Capital assets include:\n\n(i) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software), whether acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, exchange, or through a lease accounted for as financed purchase under Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards or a finance lease under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards; and\n\n(ii) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life (not ordinary repairs and maintenance).\n\n(2) For purpose of this part, capital assets do not include intangible right-to-use assets (per GASB) and right-to-use operating lease assets (per FASB). For example, assets capitalized that recognize a lessee's right to control the use of property or equipment for a period of time under a lease contract. See § 200.465.\n\nCapital expenditures means expenditures to acquire capital assets or expenditures to make additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life.\n\nCentral service cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and allocating or developing billing rates based on the allowable costs of services provided by a State, local government, or Indian Tribe to its departments and agencies on a centralized basis. The costs of these services may be allocated or billed to users.\n\nClaim means, depending on the context, either:\n\n(1) A written demand or assertion by one of the parties to a Federal award seeking as a matter of right:\n\n(i) The payment of money;\n\n(ii) The adjustment or interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Federal award; or\n\n(iii) Other relief arising under or relating to a Federal award.\n\n(2) A request for payment not in dispute when submitted.\n\nClass of Federal awards means a group of Federal awards either awarded under a specific program or group of programs or to a specific type of recipient or group of recipients to which specific provisions or exceptions may apply.\n\nCloseout means the process by which the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the Federal award have been completed and takes actions as described in § 200.344.\n\nCluster of programs means a grouping of closely related programs that share common compliance requirements. The types of clusters of programs are research and development (R&D), student financial aid (SFA), and other clusters. “Other clusters” are defined by OMB in the compliance supplement or designated by a State for Federal awards the State provides to its subrecipients that meet the definition of a cluster of programs. When designating “other clusters,” a State must identify the Federal awards included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, consistent with § 200.332. A cluster of programs must be considered one program when determining major programs as described in § 200.518, and with the exception of R&D as described in § 200.501(d), whether a program-specific audit may be elected.\n\nCognizant agency for audit means the Federal agency designated to carry out the responsibilities described in § 200.513(a). The cognizant agency for audit is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for indirect costs. A list of Federal agency Single Audit contacts can be found on the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) website.\n\nCognizant agency for indirect costs means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant agency for indirect cost is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit. For assignments of cognizant agencies, see the following:\n\n(1) For Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs): Appendix III, paragraph C.11.\n\n(2) For nonprofit organizations: Appendix IV, paragraph C.2.a.\n\n(3) For State and local governments: Appendix V, paragraph F.1.\n\n(4) For Indian Tribes: Appendix VII, paragraph D.1.\n\nCompliance supplement means an annually updated authoritative source of information for auditors that identifies existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of an audit. Auditors use it to understand the Federal program's objectives, procedures, and compliance requirements, as well as audit objectives and suggested audit procedures for determining compliance with the relevant Federal program.\n\nComputing devices means machines that acquire, store, analyze, process, and publish data and other information electronically, including accessories (or “peripherals”) for printing, transmitting and receiving, or storing electronic information. See also the definitions of supplies and information technology systems in this section.\n\nContract means, for the purpose of Federal financial assistance, a legal instrument by which a recipient or subrecipient conducts procurement transactions under a Federal award. For additional information on subrecipient and contractor determinations, see § 200.331. See also the definition of subaward in this section.\n\nContractor means an entity that receives a contract.\n\nContinuation funding means the second or subsequent budget period within an identified period of performance.\n\nCooperative agreement means a legal instrument of financial assistance between a Federal agency and a recipient or between a pass-through entity and subrecipient, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6302-6305:\n\n(1) Is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value to carry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)); and not to acquire property or services for the Federal Government or pass-through entity's direct benefit or use;\n\n(2) Is distinguished from a grant in that it provides for substantial involvement of the Federal agency or pass-through entity in carrying out the activity contemplated by the Federal award.\n\n(3) The term does not include:\n\n(i) A cooperative research and development agreement as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a; or\n\n(ii) An agreement that provides only:\n\n(A) Direct United States Government cash assistance to an individual;\n\n(B) A subsidy;\n\n(C) A loan;\n\n(D) A loan guarantee; or\n\n(E) Insurance.\n\nCorrective action means action taken by the auditee that:\n\n(1) Corrects identified deficiencies;\n\n(2) Produces recommended improvements; or\n\n(3) Demonstrates that audit findings are either invalid or do not warrant auditee action.\n\nCost allocation plan means a central service or public assistance cost allocation plan.\n\nCost objective means a program, function, activity, award, organizational subdivision, contract, or work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, products, jobs, and capital projects. A cost objective may be a major function of the recipient or subrecipient, a particular service or project, a Federal award, or an indirect cost activity, as described in subpart E. See also the definitions of final cost objective and intermediate cost objective in this section.\n\nCost sharing means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds or contributions (unless authorized by Federal statute). This term includes matching, which refers to required levels of cost share that must be provided. See § 200.306.\n\nDisallowed cost means charges to a Federal award that the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines to be unallowable in accordance with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, the provisions of this part, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\nDiscretionary award means an award in which the Federal agency, in keeping with specific statutory authority that enables the agency to exercise judgment (“discretion”), selects the recipient or the amount of Federal funding awarded through a competitive process or based on merit of proposals. A discretionary award may be selected on a non-competitive basis, as appropriate.\n\nEquipment means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost that equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes, or $10,000. See the definitions of capital assets, computing devices, general purpose equipment, information technology systems, special purpose equipment, and supplies in this section.\n\nExpenditures means charges made by a recipient or subrecipient to a project or program for which a Federal award is received.\n\n(1) The charges may be reported on a cash or accrual basis as long as the methodology is disclosed and consistently applied.\n\n(2) For reports prepared on a cash basis, expenditures are the sum of:\n\n(i) Cash disbursements for direct charges for property and services;\n\n(ii) The amount of indirect expense charged;\n\n(iii) The value of third-party in-kind contributions applied; and\n\n(iv) The amount of cash advance payments and payments made to subrecipients.\n\n(3) For reports prepared on an accrual basis, expenditures are the sum of:\n\n(i) Cash disbursements for direct charges for property and services;\n\n(ii) The amount of indirect expense incurred;\n\n(iii) The value of third-party in-kind contributions applied; and\n\n(iv) The net increase or decrease in the amounts owed by the recipient or subrecipient for:\n\n(A) Goods and other property received;\n\n(B) Services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and other payees; and\n\n(C) Programs for which no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, insurance claims, or other benefit payments.\n\nFederal agency means an “agency” as defined at 5 U.S.C. 551(1) and further clarified by 5 U.S.C. 552(f).

Known questioned costs are a subset of likely questioned costs.\n\n(5) Likely questioned cost means the auditor's best estimate of total questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs. Likely questioned costs are developed by extrapolating from audit evidence obtained, for example, by projecting known questioned costs identified in an audit sample to the entire population from which the sample was drawn. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the likely questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs.\n\n(6) Questioned costs are not improper payments until reviewed and confirmed to be improper payments as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C.\n\nReal property means land, including land improvements, structures, and appurtenances thereto, and legal interests in land, including fee interest, licenses, rights of way, and easements.

Recipients and subrecipients adopt small purchase procedures to expedite the purchase of items at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The simplified acquisition threshold set in the FAR at 48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1 is used in this part as the simplified acquisition threshold for secondary procurement activities administered under Federal awards. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold, which is less than or equal to the dollar value established in the FAR, based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. Recipients and subrecipients should also determine if local government purchasing laws apply. This threshold must never exceed the dollar value established in the FAR.\n\nSpecial purpose equipment means equipment that is used only for research, medical, scientific, or other similar technical activities. Examples of special purpose equipment include microscopes, x-ray machines, surgical instruments, spectrometers, and associated software.

A computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is below the lesser of the capitalization level established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes or $10,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. See this section's definitions of computing devices and equipment.\n\nTelecommunications cost means the cost of using communication technologies such as mobile phones, landlines, and the internet.\n\nTermination means the action a Federal agency or pass-through entity takes to discontinue a Federal award, in whole or in part, at any time before the planned end date of the period of performance. Termination does not include discontinuing a Federal award due to a lack of available funds.\n\nThird-party in-kind contributions means the value of non-cash contributions (meaning, property or services) that:\n\n(1) Benefit a project or program funded by a Federal award; and\n\n(2) Are contributed by non-Federal third parties, without charge, to a recipient or subrecipient under a Federal award.\n\nUnliquidated financial obligation means financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but not paid (liquidated) for financial reports prepared on a cash basis. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, these are financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but for which expenditures have not been recorded.\n\nUnobligated balance means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the recipient or subrecipient has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the recipient's or subrecipient's unliquidated financial obligations and expenditures under the Federal award from the cumulative amount of funds the Federal agency or pass-through entity authorized the recipient or subrecipient to obligate.\n\nVoluntary committed cost sharing means cost sharing specifically pledged voluntarily in the proposal's budget on the part of the recipient or subrecipient, which becomes a binding requirement of the Federal award. See § 200.306.\n\n\n\n[89 FR 30136, Apr. 22, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 79732, Oct. 1, 2024]",

Subpart F only applies to non-Federal entities as defined in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Federal agencies should apply the requirements to all recipients in a consistent and equitable manner to the extent permitted within applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.\n\n(3) Throughout subparts A through F, the word “must” indicates a requirement. The words “should” or “may” indicate a recommended approach and permit discretion.\n\n(4) Throughout subparts A through E, when the word “or” is used between the terms “recipient” and “subrecipient,” any requirements or recommendations in the relevant provisions of this part apply to the recipient, the subrecipient, or both, as applicable. The use of “or” between recipient and subrecipient does not mean that applicable requirements or recommendations only apply to one of these entities unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n(b) Applicability to Federal financial assistance. (1) Paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of Federal financial assistance. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section explain additional exceptions related to governing provisions and Federal program applicability. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and any other sections of this part addressing pass-through entities.\n\n(2) Subpart A (Acronyms and Definitions) and subpart B (General Provisions) apply to all Federal financial assistance, except that §§ 200.111 (English language), 200.112 (Conflict of interest), and 200.113 (Mandatory disclosures) do not apply to agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance.\n\n(3) Subpart C (Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards) and subpart D (Post Federal Award Requirements) only apply to grants and cooperative agreements with the following exceptions:\n\n(i) Section 200.203 (Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs) also applies to agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance;\n\n(ii) Section 200.216 (Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment or services) applies to loans and grants (see Pub. L. 115-232, Div. A, Title VIII, § 889, as amended); and\n\n(iii) Sections 200.303 (Internal controls) and 200.331 through 200.333 (Subrecipient monitoring and management) also apply to all types of Federal financial assistance.\n\n(4) Subpart E (Cost Principles) applies to grants and cooperative agreements, but does not apply to the following:\n\n(i) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements;\n\n(ii) Fixed amount awards, except for §§ 200.400(g), 200.402 through 200.405, and 200.407(d), which do apply;\n\n(iii) Agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance; and\n\n(iv) Federal awards to hospitals (see Appendix IX—Hospital Cost Principles).\n\n(5) Subpart F (Audit Requirements) only applies to the following items when awarded to a non-Federal entity:\n\n(i) Grants and cooperative agreements (including fixed amount awards);\n\n(ii) Contracts and subcontracts awarded under the FAR (except for fixed price contracts and subcontracts);\n\n(iii) Agreements for loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance; and\n\n(iv) Any other form of Federal financial assistance as defined by the Single Audit Act Amendment of 1996 (codified at 31 U.S.C. 7501-7507).\n\n(c) Applicability to different types of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). (1) Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity. See also paragraph (b)(5)(ii) on audit requirements. For both paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3):\n\n(i) In cases of conflict between the requirements of applicable portions of this part and the terms and conditions of the contract, the terms and conditions of the contract and the FAR prevail.\n\n(ii) When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract or subcontract, they also take precedence over this part.\n\n(iii) In addition, costs that are identified as unallowable under 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) and as stated in the FAR (48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603) are always unallowable.\n\n(2) Cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR awarded to a non-Federal entity. When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F are applicable.\n\n(3) Fixed-price contract or subcontract under the FAR awarded to a non-Federal entity. When a non-Federal entity is awarded a fixed-price contract or subcontract under the FAR, only subpart A, subpart B (except for §§ 200.111, 200.112, and 200.113), subpart D (only at § 200.303 and §§ 200.331 through 200.333), and subpart E are applicable to the contract, except that subpart E is not applicable to fixed-price contracts and subcontracts that are not negotiated.\n\n(d) Governing provisions. With the exception of subpart F, which is required by the Single Audit Act, Federal statutes or regulations govern in any circumstances where they conflict with the provisions of this part. For agreements with Indian Tribes, this includes the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended (see 25 U.S.C. 5301-5423).\n\n(e) Program applicability. Except for §§ 200.203, 200.216, and 200.331 through 200.333, the requirements in subparts C, D, and E do not apply to the following programs:\n\n(1) The block grant awards authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (including Community Services), except to the extent that subpart E apply to subrecipients of Community Services Block Grant funds pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9916(a)(1)(B);\n\n(2) Federal awards to local education agencies under 20 U.S.C. 7702-7703b, (portions of the Impact Aid program);\n\n(3) Payments under the Department of Veterans Affairs' State Home Per Diem Program (38 U.S.C. 1741); and\n\n(4) Federal awards authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, as amended:\n\n(i) Child Care and Development Block Grant (42 U.S.C. 9858).\n\n(ii) Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds of the Child Care and Development Fund (42 U.S.C. 9858).\n\n(f) Additional program applicability. Except for §§ 200.203 and 200.216, the guidance in subpart C does not apply to the following programs:\n\n(1) Entitlement Federal awards to carry out the following programs of the Social Security Act:\n\n(i) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601-619);\n\n(ii) Child Support Enforcement and Establishment of Paternity (Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 651-669b);\n\n(iii) Federal Payments for Foster Care, Prevention, and Permanency (Title IV-E of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 670-679c);\n\n(iv) Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI-AABD of the Act, as amended);\n\n(v) Medical Assistance (Medicaid) (Title XIX of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396-1396w-5) not including the State Medicaid Fraud Control program authorized by Section 1903(a)(6)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(a)(6)(B)); and\n\n(vi) Children's Health Insurance Program (Title XXI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1397aa-1397mm).\n\n(2) A Federal award for an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that is also supported by a Federal award listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.\n\n(3) Federal awards under subsection 412(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and subsection 501(a) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-422, 94 Stat. 1809), for cash assistance, medical assistance, and supplemental security income benefits to refugees and entrants and the administrative costs of providing the assistance and benefits (8 U.S.C. 1522(e)).\n\n(4) Entitlement awards under the following programs of The National School Lunch Act:\n\n(i) National School Lunch Program (Section 4 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1753);\n\n(ii) Commodity Assistance (Section 6 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1755);\n\n(iii) Special Meal Assistance (Section 11 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1759a);\n\n(iv) Summer Food Service Program for Children (Section 13 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1761); and\n\n(v) Child and Adult Care Food Program (Section 17 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1766).\n\n(5) Entitlement awards under the following programs of The Child Nutrition Act of 1966:\n\n(i) Special Milk Program (Section 3 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1772);\n\n(ii) School Breakfast Program (Section 4 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1773); and\n\n(iii) State Administrative Expenses (Section 7 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1776).\n\n(6) Entitlement awards for State Administrative Expenses under The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (Section 16 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2025).\n\n(7) Non-discretionary Federal awards under the following non-entitlement programs:\n\n(i) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (Section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966) 42 U.S.C. 1786;\n\n(ii) The Emergency Food Assistance Programs (Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983) 7 U.S.C. 7501 note; and\n\n(iii) Commodity Supplemental Food Program (Section 5 of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973) 7 U.S.C. 612c note.",

Except for subpart F, OMB may allow exceptions from requirements of this part for classes of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when the exceptions are not prohibited by statute. For example, Federal agencies may request exceptions in support of innovative program designs that apply a risk-based, data-driven framework to alleviate select compliance requirements and hold recipients accountable for good performance. See also § 200.206. Federal agencies may also request exceptions in emergency situations. When OMB allows an exception to requirements of this part, the Federal agency remains responsible for ensuring the exception is applied to Federal awards in a manner consistent with Federal statutes and regulations.\n\n(b) Statutory and regulatory exceptions. A Federal agency may adjust requirements to a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when required by Federal statutes or regulations, except for the requirements in subpart F. Except for provisions in subpart F, when a Federal statute requires exceptions to requirements of this part for a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, a Federal agency does not need OMB approval to allow those exceptions. See also § 200.106.\n\n(c) Federal agency exceptions. Federal agencies may allow exceptions to requirements of this part on a case-by-case basis for individual Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, except when the exceptions are prohibited by law or other approval is expressly required by this part. Only the cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize exceptions related to cost allocation plans or indirect cost rate proposals.

The Federal agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate type of agreement for a Federal award (for example, a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract) in accordance with this guidance. See the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-6309).\n\n(b) Fixed amount awards. The Federal agency or pass-through entity (see § 200.333) may use fixed amount awards (see the definition of fixed amount awards in § 200.1) for which the following conditions apply:\n\n(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. See § 200.101(b)(4)(ii) for further information on which provisions in subpart E (cost principles) apply to fixed amount awards. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope has measurable goals and objectives and if accurate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed budget based on a reasonable estimate of actual costs. Budgets for fixed amount awards are negotiated with the recipient or subrecipient and the total amount of Federal funding is determined in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's proposal, available pricing data, and subpart E. Accountability must be based on performance and results, which can be communicated in performance reports or through routine monitoring. There is no expected routine monitoring of the actual costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient under the Federal award. Therefore, no financial reporting is required. This does not absolve the recipient or subrecipient from the record retention requirements contained in §§ 200.334 through 200.338; nor does it absolve the recipient or subrecipient of the responsibilities of making records available for review during an audit. See § 200.101(b)(5)(i). Payments must be based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) In several partial payments. The amount of each payment as well as the “milestone” or event triggering the payment, should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award;\n\n(ii) On a unit price basis. The defined unit(s) or price(s) should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award; or\n\n(iii) In one payment at the completion of the Federal award.\n\n(2) A fixed amount award must not be used in programs that require cost sharing.\n\n(3) A fixed amount award may generate and use program income in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; however, the requirements of § 200.307 do not apply.\n\n(4) At the end of a fixed amount award, the recipient or subrecipient must certify in writing to the Federal agency or pass-through entity that the project was completed as agreed to in the Federal award, or identify those activities that were not completed, and that all expenditures were incurred in accordance with § 200.403. When the required activities were not carried out, including fixed amount awards paid on a unit price basis under 200.201(b)(1)(ii), the amount of the Federal award must be reduced by the amount that reflects the activities that were not completed in accordance with the Federal award. When the required activities were completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to any unexpended funds.\n\n(5) Periodic reports may be established for fixed amount awards.\n\n(6) Prior approval requirements that apply to fixed amount awards are § 200.308(f) (paragraphs 1 through 3, 6 through 8, and 10) and § 200.333.",

The term openly competed means opportunities that are not directed to one or more specifically identified applicants. To the extent possible, the Federal agency should communicate opportunities to the public in plain language to ensure the announcement is accessible to diverse communities of eligible applicants, including underserved communities. The Federal agency should also make efforts to limit the length and complexity of the announcement and only include the information that is necessary for the effective communication of the program objectives. Federal agencies may offer pre-application technical assistance or provide clarifying information for funding opportunities. However, Federal agencies must ensure these resources are made accessible and widely available to all potential applicants (for example, by posting answers to questions and requests on Grants.gov). The Federal agency should make every effort to identify in the NOFO all eligible applicants (for example, different types of nonprofit organizations such as labor unions and tribal organizations). The following information must be provided in a public notice:\n\n(a) Summary information in notices of funding opportunities. The Federal agency must display the following information on Grants.gov, in a location preceding the full text of the announcement:\n\n(1) Federal Agency Name;\n\n(2) Funding Opportunity Title;\n\n(3) Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement or a modification of a previously announced opportunity);\n\n(4) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if the Federal agency has assigned a number to the funding opportunity announcement);\n\n(5) Assistance Listing Number(s);\n\n(6) Funding Details. To the extent appropriate, the total amount of funding that the Federal agency expects to award, the anticipated number of awards, and the expected dollar values of individual awards, which may be a range or average;\n\n(7) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for submitting applications or Executive Order 12372 submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or preapplications. For any announcement issued before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency should provide an anticipated award date. If the NOFO states that applications will be evaluated on a “rolling” basis (that is, at different points during a specified period of time), the Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision;\n\n(8) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes the goals and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible applicants. The text of the executive summary should not exceed 500 words; and\n\n(9) Agency contact information.\n\n(b) Availability period. The Federal agency should make all funding opportunities available for application for at least 60 calendar days. However, the Federal agency may modify the availability period of an opportunity as needed. For example, extending the period may be necessary to provide technical assistance to an applicant pool that was not anticipated when the announcement was made or has less experience with applying for Federal financial assistance. The Federal agency may also determine that an availability period of less than 60 days is sufficient for a particular funding opportunity. However, no funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless the Federal agency determines that exigent circumstances justify this.\n\n(c) Full text of funding opportunities. (1) The Federal agency must include the information in Appendix I for every funding opportunity.\n\n(2) Federal agencies should ensure that funding opportunities are written using plain language. To the extent possible Federal agencies must streamline opportunities to make them accessible, particularly for funding opportunities that are new, targeted to underserved communities, or intended to reach inexperienced applicants.\n\n(3) To reduce application burden, Federal agencies should consider whether programmatic or administrative requirements specific to the agency, program, or funding opportunity must be met at the time of application or as a requirement of receiving a Federal award.",

          "content": "§ 200.206   Federal agency review of risk posed by applicants.\n(a) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data. (1) Prior to making a Federal award, the Federal agency is required to review eligibility information for applicants and financial integrity information for applicants available in OMB-designated databases per the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-117), the “Do Not Pay Initiative” (31 U.S.C. 3354), and 41 U.S.C. 2313.\n\n(2) The Federal agency is required to review the responsibility and qualification records available in the non-public segment of the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined at 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. See 41 U.S.C. 2313. The Federal agency must consider all of the information available in SAM.gov with regard to the applicant and any immediate highest-level owner, predecessor (meaning, an organization that is replaced by a successor), or subsidiary, identified for that applicant in SAM.gov. See Public Law 112-239, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013; 41 U.S.C. 2313(d). The information in the system for a prior recipient of a Federal award must demonstrate a satisfactory record of administering programs or activities under Federal financial assistance or procurement awards, and integrity and business ethics. The Federal agency may make a Federal award to a recipient that does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the risk associated with the recipient in accordance with § 200.208.\n\n(b) Risk Assessment. (1) The Federal agency must establish and maintain policies and procedures for conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risks posed by applicants before issuing Federal awards. This assessment helps identify risks that may affect the advancement toward or the achievement of a project's goals and objectives. Risk assessments assist Federal managers in determining appropriate resources and time to devote to project oversight and monitor recipient progress. This assessment may incorporate elements such as the quality of the application, award amount, risk associated with the program, cybersecurity risks, fraud risks, and impacts on local jobs and the community. If the Federal agency determines that the Federal award will be made, specific conditions that address the assessed risk may be implemented in the Federal award. The risk criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of the funding opportunity described in § 200.204.\n\n(2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal agency should consider the following items:\n\n(i) Financial stability. The applicant's record of effectively managing financial risks, assets, and resources;\n\n(ii) Management systems and standards. Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;\n\n(iii) History of performance. The applicant's record of managing previous and current Federal awards, including compliance with reporting requirements and conformance to the terms and conditions of Federal awards, if applicable;\n\n(iv) Audit reports and findings. Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F or the reports and findings of any other available audits, if applicable; and\n\n(v) Ability to effectively implement requirements. The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on recipients of Federal awards.\n\n(c) Adjustments to the Risk Assessment. The Federal agency may modify the risk assessment at any time during the period of performance, which may justify changes to the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.208.\n\n(d) Suspension and debarment compliance. The Federal agency must comply with the government-wide suspension and debarment guidance in 2 CFR part 180 and individual Federal agency suspension and debarment requirements in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal agencies must also require recipients to comply with these requirements. These requirements restrict making Federal awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal awards or participating in Federal awards.",

Payments for States are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 4A-2000, “Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.”\n\n(b) Payments for recipients and subrecipients other than States. For recipients and subrecipients other than States, payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Federal agency or the pass-through entity and the disbursement of funds by the recipient or subrecipient regardless of whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer or by other means. See § 200.302(b)(6). Except as noted in this part, the Federal agency must require recipients to use only OMB-approved, government-wide information collections to request payment.\n\n(1) The recipient or subrecipient must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient or subrecipient, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a recipient or subrecipient must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed with actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient or subrecipient in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must make timely payments to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.\n\n(2) Whenever possible, advance payment requests by the recipient or subrecipient must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards received by the recipient from the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity.\n\n(i) Advance payment mechanisms must comply with 31 CFR part 208 and include, but are not limited to, Treasury checks and electronic funds transfers.\n\n(ii) Recipients and subrecipients must be authorized to submit payment requests as often as necessary when electronic fund transfers are used or at least monthly when electronic transfers are not used. See Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).\n\n(3) Reimbursement is preferred when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the Federal agency or pass-through entity sets a specific condition per § 200.208, when requested by the recipient or subrecipient, when a Federal award is for construction, or when a significant portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.\n\n(4) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient or subrecipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the recipient or subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally aligned to the recipient's or subrecipient's disbursing cycle. After that, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the recipient or subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance payment method requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The pass-through entity must not use the working capital advance method of payment if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.\n\n(5) If available, the recipient or subrecipient must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on Federal funds before requesting additional cash payments.\n\n(6) Payments for allowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or in one of the following instances:\n\n(i) The recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; or\n\n(ii) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.” Under such conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may, after providing reasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient or subrecipient for financial obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the debt is repaid to the Federal Government.\n\n(7) A payment withheld for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award must be released to the recipient or subrecipient upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments must be made in accordance with § 200.343.\n\n(8) A payment must not be made to a recipient or subrecipient for amounts that the recipient or subrecipient withholds from contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payment must be made when the recipient or subrecipient disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of work.\n\n(9) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to the recipient or subrecipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories. However, the recipient or subrecipient must be able to account for all Federal funds received, obligated, and expended.\n\n(10) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.\n\n(11) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing accounts unless one of the following applies:\n\n(i) The recipient or subrecipient receives less than $250,000 in Federal funding per year;\n\n(ii) The best available interest-bearing account would not reasonably be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances;\n\n(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible with the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources;\n\n(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts; or\n\n(v) An interest-bearing account is not readily accessible (for example, due to public or political unrest in a foreign country).\n\n(12) The recipient or subrecipient may retain up to $500 per year of interest earned on Federal funds to use for administrative expenses of the recipient or subrecipient. Any additional interest earned on Federal funds must be returned annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. All interest in excess of $500 per year must be returned to PMS regardless of whether the recipient or subrecipient was paid through PMS. Instructions for returning interest can be found at https://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html.\n\n(13) All other Federal funds must be returned to the payment system of the Federal agency. Returns should follow the instructions provided by the Federal agency. All returns to PMS should follow the instructions provided at https://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html.",

          "content": "§ 200.306   Cost sharing.\n(a) Voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected under Federal research grants. The Federal agency may not use voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals for Federal research grants unless authorized by Federal statutes or agency regulations and specified in the notice of funding opportunity. Federal agencies are also discouraged from using voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications for other Federal financial assistance programs. If voluntary committed cost sharing is used for this purpose for other programs, the notice of funding opportunity must specify how an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered. See §§ 200.414, 200.204, and Appendix I.\n\n(b) For all Federal awards, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must accept any cost sharing funds (including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, and also including funds committed by the recipient, subrecipient, or third parties) as part of the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to a program when the funds:\n\n(1) Are verifiable in the recipient's or subrecipient's records;\n\n(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;\n\n(3) Are necessary and reasonable for achieving the objectives of the Federal award;\n\n(4) Are allowable under subpart E;\n\n(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the program's Federal authorizing statute specifically provides that Federal funds made available for the program can be applied to cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;\n\n(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal agency; and\n\n(7) Conform to other applicable provisions of this part.\n\n(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing, may be included as part of cost sharing with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the recipient's or subrecipient's approved indirect cost rate.\n\n(d) Values for recipient or subrecipient contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity authorizes the recipient or subrecipient to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing must be the lesser of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) below.\n\n(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting records at the time of donation.\n\n(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal agency or pass-through may approve using the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) at the time of donation.\n\n(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other labor may be counted as cost sharing if the service is necessary for the program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the recipient or subrecipient. When the required skills are not found in the recipient's or subrecipient's workforce, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market where the recipient or subrecipient competes for the services involved. In either case, fringe benefits that are allowable, allocable, and reasonable may be included in the valuation.\n\n(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 200.414(d) provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.\n\n(g) Donated property from third parties may include items such as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. The assessed value of donated property included as cost sharing must not exceed the property's fair market value at the time of the donation.\n\n(h) The method used for determining the value of donated equipment, buildings, and land for which title passes to the recipient or subrecipient may differ according to the following:\n\n(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the recipient or subrecipient in acquiring equipment, buildings, or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing.\n\n(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed if provided in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.420.\n\n(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the accounting policies of the recipient or subrecipient with the following qualifications:\n\n(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient or subrecipient as established by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”\n\n(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value at the time of donation.\n\n(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.\n\n(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.\n\n(j) The fair market value of third-party in-kind contributions must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used internally by the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(k) For institutions of higher education (IHE), voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should be treated differently from mandatory or voluntary committed cost sharing. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should not be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing includes faculty-donated additional time above that agreed to as part of the award.

          "content": "§ 200.307   Program income.\n(a) General. The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to earn income to defray program costs when appropriate. Program income must be used for the original purpose of the Federal award. Program income earned during the period of performance may only be used for costs incurred during the period of performance or allowable closeout costs. See § 200.472(b). Program income must be expended prior to requesting additional Federal funds. Program income exceeding amounts specified in the Federal award may be added to or deducted from the total allowable costs in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\n(b) Use of program income. There are three methods of applying program income: deduction; addition; and cost-sharing. The Federal agency should specify what program income method(s) will be used in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The deduction method will be used if the Federal agency does not specify a method for applying program income. When no program income method is specified in the Federal award, prior approval is required to use the addition or cost sharing methods. However, the addition method will be used when no method is specified for awards made to institutions of higher education (IHE) and nonprofit research institutions. In specifying alternatives to the deduction and addition methods, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients as well as between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income.\n\n(1) Deduction. Program income is deducted from the total allowable costs, reducing the overall total amount of the Federal award.\n\n(2) Addition. Program income is added to the total allowable costs, increasing the overall total amount of the Federal award.\n\n(3) Cost sharing. Program income is used to meet the Federal award's cost sharing requirement.\n\n(c) Income after the period of performance. There are no requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Federal award unless stipulated in the Federal agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the end of the period of performance as part of the closeout process. See § 200.344.\n\n(d) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to generating program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.\n\n(e) Not considered program income. The following are not considered program income unless specified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award:\n\n(1) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues the recipient or subrecipient raised.\n\n(2) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies. The proceeds must be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards of §§ 200.311, 200.313, 200.314, or as explicitly identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\n(3) License fees and royalties.

The recipient or subrecipient must request prior approvals from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for budget and program plan revisions in accordance with this section.\n\n(c) Requesting approval for budget revisions. When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient or subrecipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in their application, except if the Federal agency has approved an alternative format. Alternative formats may include the use of electronic systems, email, or other agency-approved mechanisms that document the request.\n\n(d) Federal agency or pass-through entity review. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the request for budget or program plan revision and should notify the recipient or subrecipient whether the revisions have been approved within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must inform the recipient or subrecipient in writing when a decision can be expected if more than 30 days is required for a review.\n\n(e) Limitation on other prior approval requirements. Unless specified in this guidance, the Federal agency must not impose additional prior approval requirements without OMB approval. See also §§ 200.102 and 200.407.\n\n(f) Revisions Requiring Prior Approval. A recipient or subrecipient must request prior written approval from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for the following program and budget-related reasons:\n\n(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).\n\n(2) Change in key personnel (including employees and contractors) that are identified by name or position in the Federal award.\n\n(3) The disengagement from a project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time and effort devoted to the Federal award over the course of the period of performance, by the approved project director or principal investigator.\n\n(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E as applicable.\n\n(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other budget categories.\n\n(6) Subaward activities not proposed in the application and approved in the Federal award. A change of subrecipient only requires prior approval if the Federal agency or pass-through entity includes the requirement in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In general, a Federal agency or pass-through entity should not require prior approval of a change of subrecipient unless the inclusion was a determining factor in the merit review or eligibility process. This requirement does not apply to procurement transactions for goods and services.\n\n(7) Changes in the total approved cost-sharing amount.\n\n(8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.\n\n(9) Transferring funds between the construction and non-construction work under a Federal award.\n\n(10) A no-cost extension (meaning, an extension of time that does not require the obligation of additional Federal funds) of the period of performance, other than any one-time extension authorized by the Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (g)(2). All requests for no-cost extensions should be submitted at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. The Federal agency may approve multiple no-cost extensions under a Federal award if not prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.\n\n(g) Waiver of certain prior approvals. Except for the requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10), the Federal agency is authorized to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approval requirements contained in subparts D and E. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do one or more of the following:\n\n(1) Pre-award costs. Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal award date. Expenses incurred more than 90 calendar days before the Federal award date require prior approval of the Federal agency. All costs incurred before the Federal award date are at the recipient's own risk (for example, the Federal agency is not required to reimburse such costs if the recipient does not receive the Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). Pre-award costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. See also § 200.458.\n\n(2) One-time extensions. Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. Prior approval is not required if a recipient is authorized in the terms and conditions of the Federal award to initiate a one-time extension. However, the recipient must notify the Federal agency in writing with the supporting justification and a revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. A one-time extension may not be exercised for the sole purpose of using unobligated balances. This paragraph does not preclude the Federal agency from approving further no-cost extensions to the Federal award. One-time extensions require prior approval from the Federal agency when:\n\n(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension;\n\n(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds; or\n\n(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved scope of the project.\n\n(3) Unobligated Balances. Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods.\n\n(h) Prior approvals for research awards. The prior approval requirements for the actions described in paragraph (g) of this section are automatically waived for Federal awards that support research unless stipulated in the Federal agency's regulations or terms and conditions of the Federal award. However, one-time extensions require the Federal agency's prior approval when one of the conditions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies.\n\n(i) Transfer of funds. The Federal agency must not permit a transfer of funds that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation. The Federal agency may also, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories (for example, personnel, travel, and supplies) or programs, functions, and activities when:\n\n(1) The Federal share of the Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold; and\n\n(2) The cumulative amount of a transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget, including cost share, as last approved by the Federal agency.",

Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or improved under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or the Federal agency, real property must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as it is needed for that purpose. While the property is being used for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests except as provided by the Federal agency. Easements for utility, cable, and similar services that benefit the real property and are consistent with the authorized use are not considered an encumbrance.\n\n(c) Appraisals. When an appraisal of real property is required and obtained by the recipient or subrecipient, it must be conducted by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”\n\n(d) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The instructions must specify one of the following disposition methods:\n\n(1) Retain title after compensating the Federal agency. When the recipient or subrecipient retains title to the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property. However, in situations where the recipient or subrecipient is disposing of real property acquired or improved with the Federal award and acquiring replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.\n\n(2) Sell the property and compensate the Federal agency. When a recipient or subrecipient sells the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) by the proceeds of the sale after deducting any actual and reasonable expenses paid to sell or fix up the property for sale. When the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When directed to sell the property, the recipient or subrecipient must sell the property utilizing procedures that provide for competition to the extent practicable and that result in the highest possible return.\n\n(3) Transfer title to the Federal agency or a third party designated/approved by the Federal agency. When a recipient or subrecipient transfers title to the property to a Federal agency or third party designated or approved by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to be paid an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution towards the original purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property.",

The recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity upon completion of the Federal award or when the property is no longer needed.\n\n(b) If the Federal agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority unless the Federal agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (for example, the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)). The Federal agency or pass-through entity must issue appropriate instructions to the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(c) Exempt property means property acquired under the Federal award where the Federal agency has chosen to vest title to the property to the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government. The Federal agency may only exercise this option when permitted by Federal statute and set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

Title to equipment acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient subject to the conditions of this section. This title must be a conditional title unless a Federal statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government (and the Federal agency elects to do so). A conditional title means a clear title is withheld by the Federal agency until conditions and requirements specified in the terms and conditions of a Federal award have been fulfilled. Title for equipment vested in a recipient or subrecipient is subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.\n\n(2) While the equipment is being used for the originally-authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.\n\n(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section.\n\n(b) General. A State must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures. Indian Tribes must use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with tribal laws and procedures. If such laws and procedures do not exist, Indian Tribes must follow the guidance in this section. Other recipients and subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.\n\n(c) Use. (1) The recipient or subrecipient must use equipment for the project or program for which it was acquired and for as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award. The recipient or subrecipient must not encumber the equipment without prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The Federal agency may require the submission of the applicable common forms for reporting on equipment. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the equipment may be used in other activities in the following order of priority:\n\n(i) Activities under other Federal awards from the Federal agency that funded the original program or project; then\n\n(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. These activities include consolidated equipment for information technology systems.\n\n(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient or subrecipient must also make the equipment available for use on other programs or projects supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use of the equipment must be given to other programs or projects supported by the Federal agency that financed the equipment. Second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. Use for non-federally-funded projects is also permissible, provided such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. The recipient or subrecipient should consider charging user fees as appropriate.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 200.307 to earn program income, the recipient or subrecipient must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would charge for similar services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.\n\n(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient or subrecipient may either trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement equipment.\n\n(d) Management requirements. Regardless of whether equipment is acquired in part or its entirety under the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient must manage equipment (including replacement equipment) utilizing procedures that meet the following requirements:\n\n(1) Property records must include a description of the property, a serial number or another identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), the title holder, the acquisition date, the cost of the property, the percentage of the Federal agency contribution towards the original purchase, the location, use and condition of the property, and any disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property. The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for maintaining and updating property records when there is a change in the status of the property.\n\n(2) A physical inventory of the property must be conducted, and the results must be reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.\n\n(3) A control system must be in place to ensure safeguards for preventing property loss, damage, or theft. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment must be investigated. The recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity of any loss, damage, or theft of equipment that will have an impact on the program.\n\n(4) Regular maintenance procedures must be in place to ensure the property is in proper working condition.\n\n(5) If the recipient or subrecipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be in place to ensure the highest possible return.\n\n(e) Disposition. When equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project, program, or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with Federal agency or pass-through entity disposition instructions:\n\n(1) Equipment with a current fair market value of $10,000 or less (per unit) may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the Federal agency or pass-through entity.\n\n(2) Except as provided in § 200.312(b), or if the Federal agency or pass-through entity fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current fair market value in excess of $10,000 (per-unit) may be retained or sold by the recipient or subrecipient. However, the Federal agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase by the current market value or proceeds from the sale. If the equipment is sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses associated with the selling and handling of the equipment.\n\n(3) The recipient or subrecipient may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that the recipient or subrecipient must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.\n\n(4) In cases where a recipient or subrecipient fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may direct the recipient or subrecipient to take disposition actions.\n\n(f) Equipment retention. When included in the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency may permit the recipient to retain equipment, or authorize a pass-through entity to permit the subrecipient to retain equipment, with no further obligation to the Federal Government unless prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.",

When the Federal agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the Federal agency may charge the requester a fee for the cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect the costs incurred by the Federal agency and the recipient or subrecipient. This fee is in addition to any fees the Federal agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).\n\n(2) Published research findings mean:\n\n(i) Research findings published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or\n\n(ii) Research findings publicly cited by a Federal agency in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law.\n\n(3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings. Research data does not include any of the following:\n\n(i) Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (for example, laboratory samples).\n\n(ii) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and\n\n(iii) Personnel, medical, and other personally identifiable information that, if disclosed, would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. Information that could identify a particular person in a research study is not considered research data.\n\n(f) Federal agencies should work with recipients to maximize public access to Federally funded research results and data in a manner that protects data providers' confidentiality, privacy, and security. Agencies should provide guidance to recipients to make restricted-access data available through a variety of mechanisms. FOIA may not be the most appropriate mechanism for providing access to intangible property, including Federally funded research results and data.",

The recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procedures for procurement transactions under a Federal award or subaward, including for acquisition of property or services. These documented procurement procedures must be consistent with State, local, and tribal laws and regulations and the standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.\n\n(b) Oversight of contractors. Recipients and subrecipients must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders. See also § 200.501(h).\n\n(c) Conflicts of interest. (1) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, agent, or board member with a real or apparent conflict of interest may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by the Federal award. A conflict of interest includes when the employee, officer, agent, or board member, any member of their immediate family, their partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from an entity considered for a contract. An employee, officer, agent, and board member of the recipient or subrecipient may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors. However, the recipient or subrecipient may set standards for situations where the financial interest is not substantial or a gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The recipient's or subrecipient's standards of conduct must also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations by its employees, officers, agents, or board members.\n\n(2) If the recipient or subrecipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, local government, or Indian Tribe, the recipient or subrecipient must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest mean that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.\n\n(d) Avoidance of unnecessary or duplicative items. The recipient's or subrecipient's procedures must avoid the acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. When appropriate, an analysis should be made between leasing and purchasing property or equipment to determine the most economical approach.\n\n(e) Procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing. When appropriate for the procurement or use of common or shared goods and services, recipients and subrecipients are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements for procurement transactions. These or similar procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing may foster greater economy and efficiency. Documented procurement actions of this type (using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements) will meet the competition requirements of this part.\n\n(f) Use of excess and surplus Federal property. The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use excess and surplus Federal property instead of purchasing new equipment and property when it is feasible and reduces project costs.\n\n(g) Use of value engineering clauses. When practical, the recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering means analyzing each contract item or task to ensure its essential function is provided at the overall lowest cost.\n\n(h) Responsible contractors. The recipient or subrecipient must award contracts only to responsible contractors that possess the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed contract. The recipient or subrecipient must consider contractor integrity, public policy compliance, proper classification of employees (see the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201, chapter 8), past performance record, and financial and technical resources when conducting a procurement transaction. See also § 200.214.\n\n(i) Procurement records. The recipient or subrecipient must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of each procurement transaction. These records must include the rationale for the procurement method, contract type selection, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.\n\n(j) Time-and-materials type contracts. (1) The recipient or subrecipient may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a recipient or subrecipient is the sum of:\n\n(i) The actual cost of materials; and\n\n(ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.\n\n(2) Because this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the recipient or subrecipient awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.\n\n(k) Settlement of contractual and administrative issues. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of its procurement transactions. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the recipient or subrecipient of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Federal agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the recipient or subrecipient unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. The recipient or subrecipient must report violations of law to the Federal, State, or local authority with proper jurisdiction.\n\n(l) Examples of labor and employment practices. (1) The procurement standards in this subpart do not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from:\n\n(i) Using Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) or similar forms of pre-hire collective bargaining agreements;\n\n(ii) Requiring construction contractors to use hiring preferences or goals for people residing in high-poverty areas, disadvantaged communities as defined by the Justice40 Initiative (see OMB Memorandum M-21-28), or high-unemployment census tracts within a region no smaller than the county where a federally funded construction project is located. The hiring preferences or goals should be consistent with the policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient, and must not prohibit interstate hiring;\n\n(iii) Requiring a contractor to use hiring preferences or goals for individuals with barriers to employment (as defined in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102(24)), including women and people from underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 14091;\n\n(iv) Using agreements intended to ensure uninterrupted delivery of services; using agreements intended to ensure community benefits; or\n\n(v) Offering employees of a predecessor contractor rights of first refusal under a new contract.\n\n(2) Recipients and subrecipients may use the practices listed in paragraph (1) if consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, the objectives and purposes of the applicable Federal financial assistance program, and other requirements of this part.",

          "content": "§ 200.319   Competition.\n(a) All procurement transactions under the Federal award must be conducted in a manner that provides full and open competition and is consistent with the standards of this section and § 200.320.\n\n(b) To ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids must be excluded from competing on those procurements.\n\n(c) Examples of situations that may restrict competition include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms for them to qualify to do business;\n\n(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;\n\n(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;\n\n(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;\n\n(5) Organizational conflicts of interest;\n\n(6) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and\n\n(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.\n\n(d) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:\n\n(1) Are made in accordance with § 200.319(b);\n\n(2) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the property, equipment, or service being procured. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the property, equipment, or service to be procured. When necessary, the description must provide minimum essential characteristics and standards to which the property, equipment, or service must conform. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to clearly and accurately describe the technical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description of features may be used to provide procurement requirements. The specific features of the named brand must be clearly stated; and\n\n(3) Identify any additional requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors that will be used in evaluating bids or proposals.\n\n(e) The recipient or subrecipient must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products used in procurement transactions are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open competition. When establishing or amending prequalified lists, the recipient or subrecipient must consider objective factors that evaluate price and cost to maximize competition. The recipient or subrecipient must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.\n\n(f) To the extent consistent with established practices and legal requirements applicable to the recipient or subrecipient, this subpart does not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from developing written procedures for procurement transactions that incorporate a scoring mechanism that rewards bidders that commit to specific numbers and types of U.S. jobs, minimum compensation, benefits, on-the-job-training for employees making work products or providing services on a contract, and other worker protections. This subpart also does not prohibit recipients and subrecipients from making inquiries of bidders about these subjects and assessing the responses. Any scoring mechanism must be consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\n(g) Noncompetitive procurements can only be awarded in accordance with § 200.320(c).",

          "section_name": "§ 200.320   Procurement methods.",
          "content": "§ 200.320   Procurement methods.\nThere are three types of procurement methods described in this section: informal procurement methods (for micro-purchases and simplified acquisitions); formal procurement methods (through sealed bids or proposals); and noncompetitive procurement methods. For any of these methods, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with the standards of this section and §§ 200.317, 200.318, and 200.319.\n\n(a) Informal procurement methods for small purchases. These procurement methods expedite the completion of transactions, minimize administrative burdens, and reduce costs. Informal procurement methods may be used when the value of the procurement transaction under the Federal award does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in § 200.1. Recipients and subrecipients may also establish a lower threshold. Informal procurement methods include:\n\n(1) Micro-purchases—(i) Distribution. The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold defined in § 200.1. To the extent practicable, the recipient or subrecipient should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.\n\n(ii) Micro-purchase awards. Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the recipient or subrecipient considers the price reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history, or other information; and maintains documents to support its conclusion. Purchase cards may be used as a method of payment for micro-purchases.\n\n(iii) Micro-purchase thresholds. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold used by the recipient or subrecipient must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations. The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section.\n\n(iv) Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000. The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to be made available to the Federal agency or pass-through entity and auditors in accordance with § 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following:\n\n(A) A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in § 200.520 for the most recent audit;\n\n(B) An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or,\n\n(C) For public institutions, a higher threshold is consistent with State law.\n\n(v) Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold over $50,000. Micro-purchase thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must submit a request that includes the requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. The increased threshold is valid until any factor that was relied on in the establishment and rationale of the threshold changes.\n\n(2) Simplified acquisitions—(i) Simplified acquisition procedures. The aggregate dollar amount of the procurement transaction is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If simplified acquisition procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate.\n\n(ii) Simplified acquisition thresholds. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures, which may be lower than, but must not exceed, the threshold established in the FAR.\n\n(b) Formal procurement methods. Formal procurement methods are required when the value of the procurement transaction under a Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold of the recipient or subrecipient. Formal procurement methods are competitive and require public notice. The following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement transactions above the simplified acquisition threshold determined by the recipient or subrecipient in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section:\n\n(1) Sealed bids. This is a procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited through an invitation and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation and is the lowest in price. The sealed bids procurement method is preferred for procuring construction services.\n\n(i) For sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:\n\n(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; (B) Two or more responsible bidders have been identified as willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and\n\n(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm-fixed-price contract, and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally based on price.\n\n(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:\n\n(A) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them with sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate. For local governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised.\n\n(B) The invitation for bids must define the items or services with specific information, including any required specifications, for the bidder to properly respond;\n\n(C) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids. For local governments, the bids must be opened publicly.\n\n(D) A firm-fixed-price contract is awarded in writing to the lowest responsive bid and responsible bidder. When specified in the invitation for bids, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life-cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is the lowest. Payment discounts must only be used to determine the low bid when the recipient or subrecipient determines they are a valid factor based on prior experience.\n\n(E) The recipient or subrecipient must document and provide a justification for all bids it rejects.\n\n(2) Proposals. This is a procurement method used when conditions are not appropriate for using sealed bids. This procurement method may result in either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement contract. They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n(i) Requests for proposals require public notice, and all evaluation factors and their relative importance must be identified. Proposals must be solicited from multiple qualified entities. To the maximum extent practicable, any proposals submitted in response to the public notice must be considered.\n\n(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for conducting technical evaluations and making selections.\n\n(iii) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the recipient or subrecipient considering price and other factors; and\n\n(iv) The recipient or subrecipient may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby the offeror's qualifications are evaluated, and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where the price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used to procure architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services. The method may not be used to purchase other services provided by A/E firms that are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.\n\n(c) Noncompetitive procurement. There are specific circumstances in which the recipient or subrecipient may use a noncompetitive procurement method. The noncompetitive procurement method may only be used if one of the following circumstances applies:\n\n(1) The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);\n\n(2) The procurement transaction can only be fulfilled by a single source;\n\n(3) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from providing public notice of a competitive solicitation;\n\n(4) The recipient or subrecipient requests in writing to use a noncompetitive procurement method, and the Federal agency or pass-through entity provides written approval; or\n\n(5) After soliciting several sources, competition is determined inadequate.",

The recipient or subrecipient must submit the technical specifications of proposed procurements when requested by the Federal agency or pass-through entity. This review should take place prior to the time the specifications are incorporated into a solicitation document. When the recipient or subrecipient desires to accomplish the review after a solicitation has been developed, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications. In those cases, the review should be limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.\n\n(b) When requested, the recipient or subrecipient must provide procurement documents (such as requests for proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) to the Federal agency or pass-through entity for pre-procurement review. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct a pre-procurement review when:\n\n(1) The recipient's or subrecipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;\n\n(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition, or only one bid is expected to be received in response to a solicitation;\n\n(3) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and specifies a “brand name” product;\n\n(4) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and a sealed bid procurement is to be awarded to an entity other than the apparent low bidder; or\n\n(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(c) The recipient or subrecipient is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.\n\n(1) The recipient or subrecipient may request that the Federal agency or pass-through entity review its procurement system to determine whether it meets these standards for its system to be certified.

The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the oversight of the Federal award. The recipient and subrecipient must monitor their activities under Federal awards to ensure they are compliant with all requirements and meeting performance expectations. Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient must cover each program, function, or activity. See also § 200.332.\n\n(b) Reporting program performance. The Federal agency must use OMB-approved common information collections (for example, Research Performance Progress Reports) when requesting performance reporting information. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect performance reports more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with § 200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should align the due dates of performance reports and financial reports. When reporting program performance, the recipient or subrecipient must relate financial data and project or program accomplishments to the performance goals and objectives of the Federal award. Also, the recipient or subrecipient must provide cost information to demonstrate cost-effective practices (for example, through unit cost data) when required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports. Reporting requirements must clearly indicate a standard against which the recipient's or subrecipient's performance can be measured. Reporting requirements should not solicit information from the recipient or subrecipient that is not necessary for the effective monitoring or evaluation of the Federal award. Federal agencies should consult monitoring framework documents such as the agency's Evaluation Plan to make that determination. As noted in OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 280, measures of customer experience are of co-equal importance as traditional measures of financial and operational performance.\n\n(c) Submitting performance reports. (1) The recipient or subrecipient must submit performance reports as required by the Federal award. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except if specific conditions are applied (See § 200.208). Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year Federal awards. The final performance report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final performance report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also § 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any performance report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(2) As applicable, performance reports should contain information on the following:\n\n(i) A comparison of accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the reporting period (for example, comparing costs to units of accomplishment). Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the Federal agency program, the Federal agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.\n\n(ii) Explanations on why established goals or objectives were not met; and\n\n(iii) Additional information, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or higher-than-expected unit costs.\n\n(d) Construction performance reports. Federal agencies or pass-through entities rely on on-site technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under Federal awards for construction. Therefore, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require additional performance reports when necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of Federal awards are met.\n\n(e) Significant developments. When a significant development that could impact the Federal award occurs between performance reporting due dates, the recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Significant developments include events that enable meeting milestones and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or that produce different beneficial results than originally planned. Significant developments also include problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will impact the recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet milestones or the objectives of the Federal award. When significant developments occur that negatively impact the Federal Award, the recipient or subrecipient must include information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.\n\n(f) Site visits.

The pass-through entity is responsible for making case-by-case determinations to determine whether the entity receiving Federal funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal agency may require the pass-through entity to comply with additional guidance to make these determinations, provided such guidance does not conflict with this section. The Federal agency does not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients or contractors of any tier; however, the Federal agency is responsible for monitoring the pass-through entity's oversight of first-tier subrecipients. All of the characteristics listed below may not be present in all cases, and some characteristics from both categories may be present at the same time. No single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. The pass-through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract. In making this determination, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement.\n\n(a) Subrecipients. A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the Federal award and creates a Federal financial assistance relationship with a subrecipient. See the definition of Subaward in § 200.1. Characteristics that support the classification of the entity as a subrecipient include, but are not limited to, when the entity:\n\n(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;\n\n(2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether the objectives of a Federal program were met;\n\n(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision-making;\n\n(4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and\n\n(5) Implements a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.\n\n(b) Contractors. A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient's or subrecipient's use and creates a procurement relationship with a contractor. See the definition of contract in § 200.1. Characteristics that support a procurement relationship between the recipient or subrecipient and a contractor include, but are not limited to, when the contractor:\n\n(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;\n\n(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;\n\n(3) Normally operates in a competitive environment;\n\n(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the implementation of a Federal program; and\n\n(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of a Federal program as a result of the agreement.

Verification methods are provided in § 180.300, which include confirming in SAM.gov that a potential subrecipient is not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal funds.\n\n(b) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the information provided below. A pass-through entity must provide the best available information when some of the information below is unavailable. A pass-through entity must provide the unavailable information when it is obtained. Required information includes:\n\n(1) Federal award identification.\n\n(i) Subrecipient's name (must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier);\n\n(ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier;\n\n(iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);\n\n(iv) Federal Award Date;\n\n(v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date;\n\n(vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date;\n\n(vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated in the subaward;\n\n(viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity, including the current financial obligation;\n\n(ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity;\n\n(x) Federal award project description, as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA);\n\n(xi) Name of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and contact information for awarding official of the pass-through entity;\n\n(xii) Assistance Listings title and number; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at the time of disbursement;\n\n(xiii) Identification of whether the Federal award is for research and development; and\n\n(xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is used in accordance with § 200.414).\n\n(2) All requirements of the subaward, including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;\n\n(3) Any additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient for the pass-through entity to meet its responsibilities under the Federal award. This includes information and certifications (see § 200.415) required for submitting financial and performance reports that the pass-through entity must provide to the Federal agency;\n\n(4) Indirect cost rate:\n\n(i) An approved indirect cost rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal Government. If no approved rate exists, a pass-through entity must determine the appropriate rate in collaboration with the subrecipient. The indirect cost rate may be either:\n\n(A) An indirect cost rate negotiated between the pass-through entity and the subrecipient. These rates may be based on a prior negotiated rate between a different pass-through entity and the subrecipient, in which case the pass-through entity is not required to collect information justifying the rate but may elect to do so; or\n\n(B) The de minimis indirect cost rate.\n\n(ii) The pass-through entity must not require the use of the de minimis indirect cost rate if the subrecipient has an approved indirect cost rate negotiated with the Federal Government. Subrecipients may elect to use the cost allocation method to account for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.405(d).\n\n(5) A requirement that the subrecipient permit the pass-through entity and auditors to access the subrecipient's records and financial statements for the pass-through entity to fulfill its monitoring requirements; and\n\n(6) Appropriate terms and conditions concerning the closeout of the subaward.\n\n(c) Evaluate each subrecipient's fraud risk and risk of noncompliance with a subaward to determine the appropriate subrecipient monitoring described in paragraph (f) of this section. When evaluating a subrecipient's risk, a pass-through entity should consider the following:\n\n(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;\n\n(2) The results of previous audits. This includes considering whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in accordance with subpart F and the extent to which the same or similar subawards have been audited as a major program;\n\n(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and\n\n(4) The extent and results of any Federal agency monitoring (for example, if the subrecipient also receives Federal awards directly from the Federal agency).\n\n(d) If appropriate, consider implementing specific conditions in a subaward as described in § 200.208 and notify the Federal agency of the specific conditions.\n\n(e) Monitor the activities of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. The pass-through entity is responsible for monitoring the overall performance of a subrecipient to ensure that the goals and objectives of the subaward are achieved. In monitoring a subrecipient, a pass-through entity must:\n\n(1) Review financial and performance reports.\n\n(2) Ensure that the subrecipient takes corrective action on all significant developments that negatively affect the subaward. Significant developments include Single Audit findings related to the subaward, other audit findings, site visits, and written notifications from a subrecipient of adverse conditions which will impact their ability to meet the milestones or the objectives of a subaward. When significant developments negatively impact the subaward, a subrecipient must provide the pass-through entity with information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.\n\n(3) Issue a management decision for audit findings pertaining only to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by § 200.521.\n\n(4) Resolve audit findings specifically related to the subaward. However, the pass-through entity is not responsible for resolving cross-cutting audit findings that apply to the subaward and other Federal awards or subawards. If a subrecipient has a current Single Audit report and has not been excluded from receiving Federal funding (meaning, has not been debarred or suspended), the pass-through entity may rely on the subrecipient's cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit to perform audit follow-up and make management decisions related to cross-cutting audit findings in accordance with section § 200.513(a)(4)(viii). Such reliance does not eliminate the responsibility of the pass-through entity to issue subawards that conform to agency and award-specific requirements, to manage risk through ongoing subaward monitoring, and to monitor the status of the findings that are specifically related to the subaward.\n\n(f) Depending upon the pass-through entity's assessment of the risk posed by the subrecipient (as described in paragraph (c) of this section), the following monitoring tools may be useful for the pass-through entity to ensure proper accountability and compliance with program requirements and achievement of performance goals:\n\n(1) Providing subrecipients with training and technical assistance on program-related matters;\n\n(2) Performing site visits to review the subrecipient's program operations; and\n\n(3) Arranging for agreed-upon-procedures engagements as described in § 200.425.\n\n(g) Verify that a subrecipient is audited as required by subpart F of this part.\n\n(h) Consider whether the results of a subrecipient's audit, site visits, or other monitoring necessitate adjustments to the pass-through entity's records.\n\n(i) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in § 200.339 and in program regulations.",

The recipient must submit a revised final financial report when all applicable indirect cost rates have been finalized.\n\n(c) The recipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under the Federal award no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under a subaward no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(d) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not delay payments to the recipient or subrecipient for costs meeting the requirements of subpart E of this part.\n\n(e) The recipient or subrecipient must promptly refund any unobligated funds that the Federal agency or pass-through entity paid and that are not authorized to be retained. See OMB Circular A-129 and § 200.346.\n\n(f) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must make all necessary adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received (for example, to reflect the disallowance of any costs or the deobligation of an unliquidated balance).\n\n(g) The recipient or subrecipient must account for any property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.330.\n\n(h) The Federal agency must make every effort to complete all closeout actions no later than one year after the end of the period of performance. If the indirect cost rate has not been finalized and would delay closeout, the Federal agency is authorized to mutually agree with the recipient to close an award using the current or most recently negotiated rate. However, the recipient is not required to agree to a final rate for a Federal award for the purpose of prompt closeout.\n\n(i) If the recipient does not comply with the requirements of this section, including submitting all final reports, the Federal agency must report the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award in SAM.gov. A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter or amend information in SAM.gov. Federal agencies may also pursue other enforcement actions as appropriate. See § 200.339.",

The recipient and subrecipient must also use these principles as a guide in pricing fixed-price contracts and subcontracts when costs are used in determining the appropriate price. These cost principles do not apply to:\n\n(1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on items such as education allowance or published tuition rates and fees.\n\n(2) Capitation awards based on case counts or the number of beneficiaries.\n\n(3) Fixed amount awards, except as provided in § 200.101(b). See also § 200.201.\n\n(4) Federal awards to hospitals (see Appendix IX of this part).\n\n(5) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements.\n\n(6) Other awards under which the recipient or subrecipient is not required to account for actual costs incurred.\n\n(b) Federal contract. A Federal contract awarded to a recipient is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). It must incorporate the applicable CAS requirements per 48 CFR Chapter 99 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30). With respect to the allocation of costs, the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 CFR parts 9904 or 9905 take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E. When a contract with a recipient is subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (for example, CAS 414—48 CFR 9904.414—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital, and CAS 417—48 CFR 9904.417—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction, apply instead of the allowability provisions of § 200.449). For example, the allowability of costs in CAS-covered contracts is determined first by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards rather than the allowability provisions in § 200.449 (unless the CAS does not address the specific costs). In complying with those requirements, the recipient's application of cost accounting practices for estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs for Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts must be consistent with 48 CFR. The recipient only needs to maintain one set of accounting records supporting the allocation of costs if the recipient administers both Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts.\n\n(c) Exemptions. Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be considered to be similar to for-profit organizations in terms of the applicability of cost principles. These nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles that apply to for-profit organizations located at 48 CFR 31.2. Appendix VIII contains a list of these nonprofit organizations. Other organizations may be added to this list if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.",

For example, a cost must not be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost.\n\n(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for State and local governments and Indian Tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part.\n\n(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a prior period. See § 200.306(b).\n\n(g) Be adequately documented. See §§ 200.300 through 200.309.\n\n(h) Administrative closeout costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s).

A cost is allocable to a Federal award or other cost objective if the cost is assignable to that Federal award or other cost objective in accordance with the relative benefits received. This standard is met if the cost satisfies any of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;\n\n(2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; or\n\n(3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the recipient or subrecipient and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with these cost principles.\n\n(b) Allocation of indirect costs. All activities which benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the recipient or subrecipient or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs.\n\n(c) Limitation on charging certain allocable costs to other Federal awards. A cost allocable to a particular Federal award may not be charged to other Federal awards (for example, to overcome fund deficiencies or to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards). However, this prohibition would not preclude the recipient or subrecipient from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.\n\n(d) Direct cost allocation principles. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit However, when those proportions cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c), the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved, when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.439.\n\n(e) Costs of contracts subject to CAS.

Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as direct or indirect costs. See § 200.405.\n\n(b) Application to Federal awards. The association of costs with a Federal award determines whether costs are direct or indirect. Costs charged directly to a Federal award are typically incurred specifically for that Federal award (including, for example, supplies needed to achieve the award's objectives and the proportion of employee compensation and fringe benefits expended in relation to that specific award). Costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct costs if they are directly related to a specific award (including, for example, extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities, cybersecurity, integrated data systems, asset management systems, performance management costs, program evaluation costs, or other institutional service operations).\n\n(c) Administrative and clerical staff salaries. Administrative and clerical staff salaries should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if they meet all of the following conditions:\n\n(1) The administrative or clerical services are integral to a Federal award;\n\n(2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with a Federal award; and\n\n(3) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.\n\n(d) Minor items. A direct cost of a minor amount may be treated as an indirect cost, for reasons of practicality, provided that it is treated consistently for all Federal and non-Federal purposes.\n\n(e) Treatment of unallowable costs in determining indirect cost rates. The costs of certain activities are not allowable as charges to Federal awards. Even though these costs are unallowable, they must be treated as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs if they represent activities which:\n\n(1) Include the salaries of personnel;\n\n(2) Occupy space; and\n\n(3) Benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs.\n\n(f) Treatment of certain costs for nonprofit organizations. For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities performed by the nonprofit organization primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public when significant and necessary to the organization's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect costs. Some examples of these types of activities include:\n\n(1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See § 200.454.\n\n(2) Providing services and information to members, the government, or the public. See §§ 200.454 and 200.450.\n\n(3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See §§ 200.421 and 200.450.\n\n(4) Conferences (except those held to conduct the general administration of the recipient or subrecipient). See also § 200.432.\n\n(5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in the recipient's or subrecipient's operation.

For major Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and major nonprofit organizations, indirect costs must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration.” “Facilities” is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. “Administration” is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the director's office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of “Facilities” (including cross allocations from other pools, where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the “Administration” category; for IHEs, they are included in the “Facilities” category. Major IHEs are defined as those required to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in Appendix III. Major nonprofit organizations are those which receive more than $10 million in direct Federal funding.\n\n(b) Diversity of nonprofit organizations. It is not always possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect costs for nonprofit organizations due to the diversity of their accounting practices. The association of a cost with a Federal award is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs. However, typical examples of indirect cost for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.\n\n(c) Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated Indirect Cost Rates. (See § 200.306.)\n\n(1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies. A Federal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations. The recipient or subrecipient may notify OMB of any disputes with Federal agencies regarding the application of a federally negotiated indirect cost rate.\n\n(3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.\n\n(4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved under paragraph (e). As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants before posting a notice of funding opportunity. See § 200.204.\n\n(d) Pass-through entities. Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in § 200.332(b)(4) and must accept all federally negotiated indirect costs rates for subrecipients.\n\n(e) Appendices. Requirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in the following Appendices:\n\n(1) Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);\n\n(2) Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;\n\n(3) Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;\n\n(4) Appendix VI to Part 200—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;\n\n(5) Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and\n\n(6) Appendix IX to Part 200—Hospital Cost Principles.\n\n(f) De minimis rate. Recipients and subrecipients that do not have a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate (including provisional rate) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of up to 15 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC). The recipient or subrecipient is authorized to determine the appropriate rate up to this limit. Federal agencies and pass-through entities may not require recipients and subrecipients to use a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate or the rate elected pursuant to this subsection unless required by Federal statute or regulation. The de minimis rate must not be applied to cost reimbursement contracts issued directly by the Federal Government in accordance with the FAR. Recipients and subrecipients are not required to use the de minimis rate. When applying the de minimis rate, costs must be consistently charged as either direct or indirect costs and may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. The de minimis rate does not require documentation to justify its use and may be used indefinitely. Once elected, the recipient or subrecipient must use the de minimis rate for all Federal awards until the recipient or subrecipient chooses to receive a negotiated rate.\n\n(g) One-time extension of indirect rates. A recipient or subrecipient with a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of that agreement for up to four years. This extension will be subject to review and approval by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If this extension is granted, the recipient or subrecipient may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. The recipient or subrecipient must re-apply to negotiate a new rate when the extension ends. After a new rate has been negotiated, the recipient or subrecipient may again apply for a one-time extension of the new rate in accordance with this paragraph.",

          "content": "§ 200.415   Required certifications.\n(a) Financial reports must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the recipient, which reads as follows: “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).”\n\n(b) Subrecipients under the Federal award must certify to the pass-through entity whenever applying for funds, requesting payment, and submitting financial reports: “I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information provided herein is true, complete, and accurate. I am aware that the provision of false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil, or administrative consequences including, but not limited to violations of U.S. Code Title 18, Sections 2, 1001, 1343 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812.” Each such certification must be maintained pursuant to the requirements of § 200.334. This paragraph applies to all tiers of subrecipients.\n\n(c) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal must comply with the following:\n\n(1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the recipient, must be certified by the recipient using the Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan or Certificate of Indirect Costs as set forth in appendices III through VII, and IX of this part. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the recipient by an individual at a level no lower than the vice president or chief financial officer of the recipient that submits the proposal.\n\n(2) The Federal Government may either disallow all indirect costs or unilaterally establish an indirect cost rate when the recipient fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing a rate. This rate should be based upon audited historical data or other data furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. The rate established must ensure that potentially unallowable costs are not reimbursed. Alternatively, the recipient may use the de minimis indirect cost rate. See § 200.414(f).\n\n(d) Nonprofit organizations must certify that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization as defined in § 200.414(a), if applicable.\n\n(e) The recipient must certify that the requirements and standards for lobbying (see § 200.450) have been met when submitting its indirect cost rate proposal.",

A central service cost allocation plan is established to allow such department to claim a portion of centralized service costs that are incurred in proportion to the award's activities. Examples of centralized service costs may include motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, and accounting. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan establishes this process.\n\n(b) Individual departments typically charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate proposal for each operating department is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal awards. Indirect costs include:\n\n(1) The indirect costs originating in each operating department of the State, local government, or Indian Tribe carrying out Federal awards; and\n\n(2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.\n\n(c) The requirements for developing and submitting cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices V, VI, and VII of this part.",

          "content": "§ 200.430   Compensation—personal services.\n(a) General. Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include fringe benefits addressed in § 200.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this part and that the total compensation for individual employees:\n\n(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the recipient or subrecipient consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities;\n\n(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's laws, rules, or written policies and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and\n\n(3) Is determined and supported as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, when applicable.\n\n(b) Reasonableness. Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the recipient or subrecipient. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient or subrecipient competes for the kind of employees involved.\n\n(c) Professional activities outside the recipient or subrecipient. Unless the Federal agency expressly authorizes an arrangement, a recipient or subrecipient must follow its written policies and procedures concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the recipient or subrecipient for non-organizational compensation. Where the recipient or subrecipient does not have written policies or procedures, or they do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require the recipient or subrecipient to allocate the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards between:\n\n(1) Recipient or subrecipient activities, and\n\n(2) Non-organizational professional activities. Appropriate arrangements governing compensation must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis if the Federal agency considers the extent of non-organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n\n(d) Unallowable costs. (1) Costs unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section solely because they constitute personnel compensation.\n\n(2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with Federal statute. See 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(16), 41 U.S.C. 1127, and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(16) for the ceiling amount, covered compensation subject to the ceiling, covered employees, and other relevant provisions for cost-reimbursement contracts. For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.\n\n(e) Special considerations. Special considerations in determining the allowability of compensation will be given to any change in a recipient's or subrecipient's compensation policy resulting in a substantial increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy.\n\n(f) Incentive compensation. Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, efficient performance, suggestion awards, or safety awards is allowable to the extent that the overall compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued according to an agreement entered into in good faith between the recipient or subrecipient and the employees before the services were rendered, or according to an established plan followed by the recipient or subrecipient so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment.\n\n(g) Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses. (1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must:\n\n(i) Be supported by a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;\n\n(ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the recipient or subrecipient;\n\n(iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the recipient or subrecipient, not exceeding 100 percent of compensated activities (for IHEs, this is the IBS);\n\n(iv) Encompass federally-assisted and all other activities compensated by the recipient or subrecipient on an integrated basis but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policy;\n\n(v) Comply with the established accounting policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient (See paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and\n\n(vi) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity.\n\n(vii) Budget estimates (meaning, estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting purposes, provided that:\n\n(A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the activity performed;\n\n(B) Significant changes in the related work activity (as defined by the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies) are promptly identified and entered into the records. Short-term (such as one or two months) fluctuations between workload categories do not need to be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term; and\n\n(C) The recipient's or subrecipient's system of internal controls includes processes to perform periodic after-the-fact reviews of interim charges made to a Federal award based on budget estimates. All necessary adjustments must be made so that the final amount charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated.\n\n(viii) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for example, the Institutional Base Salary (IBS) for IHEs), records may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distribution of total activities.\n\n(ix) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. Therefore, a precise assessment of factors contributing to costs is not required when IHEs record salaries and wages charged to Federal awards.\n\n(2) For records that meet the standards required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the recipient or subrecipient is not required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed other than that referenced in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.\n\n(3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records indicating the total number of hours worked each day.\n\n(4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing requirements on Federal awards must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from Federal awards.\n\n(5) States, local governments, and Indian Tribes may use substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages to Federal awards either in place of or in addition to the records described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, “rolling” time studies, case counts, or other quantifiable measures of work performed.\n\n(i) Substitute systems that use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards, including:\n\n(A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii);\n\n(B) The sample must cover the entire period involved; and\n\n(C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled.\n\n(ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors and clerical and support staff, based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable.\n\n(iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in paragraph (5)(i) may be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts allocated to Federal awards will be minimal or if it concludes that the system proposed by the recipient or subrecipient will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which complies with the standards.\n\n(6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on outcomes and milestones for program performance when these are clearly documented. These plans are acceptable as an alternative to requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\n\n(7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a recipient or subrecipient may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided the plans are approved in advance by all involved Federal agencies. In these instances, the recipient or subrecipient must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to time charged.\n\n(8) For a recipient or subrecipient whose records do not meet the standards described in this section, the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or equivalent documentation supporting the records as required in this section.\n\n(h) Nonprofit organizations. This paragraph (h) provides guidance specific to only nonprofit organizations. For compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the immediate families thereof, a determination must be made that the compensation is reasonable for the actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings above actual costs. Compensation may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, off-site or incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials.\n\n(i) Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). This paragraph provides guidance specific to only IHEs.\n\n(1) Determining allowable personnel costs. Certain conditions require special consideration and possible limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among such conditions are the following:\n\n(i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable amounts for activities contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etcetera), managing substances/chemicals, managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences.\n\n(ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable under the written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) do not need to be included in the records described in paragraph (g). To charge payments of incidental activities directly, such activities must either be expressly authorized in the Federal award budget or receive prior written approval by the Federal agency.\n\n(2) Salary basis. Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the academic year are allowable at the institutional base salary (IBS) rate. Except as noted in paragraph (i)(1)(ii), in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of the faculty at an institution. IBS is the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS excludes any income an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is prior approval by the Federal agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award may not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member worked on the Federal award.\n\n(3) Intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) consulting. Intra-IHE consulting by faculty should be undertaken as an IHE responsibility requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation, and the work performed by the faculty members is in addition to their regular responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are expressly authorized in the Federal award or approved in writing by the Federal agency.\n\n(4) Extra service pay. Extra service pay typically represents overload compensation, subject to institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay results from Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(i) The IHE establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, not just those working on Federal awards.\n\n(ii) The IHE establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS, which is specific enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This definition may be described in appointment letters or other documentation.\n\n(iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS pay rate and additional work performed. See paragraph (i)(2) of this section.\n\n(iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the IHE.\n\n(v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards, including extra service payments, are subject to the standards of documentation as described in paragraph (g).\n\n(5) Periods outside the academic year. (i) Except as specified for teaching activity in paragraph (i)(5)(ii) of this section, charges for work performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base salary period must be at a rate not more than the IBS.\n\n(ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in IBS period must be based on the written policy of the IHE governing compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods.\n\n(6) Part-time faculty. Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only part-time appointments must be determined at a rate not more than that regularly paid for part-time assignments.\n\n(7) Sabbatical leave costs. Rules for sabbatical leave are as follows:\n\n(i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable, provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. These costs must be allocated equitably among all related activities of the IHE.\n\n(ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual experience under its sabbatical leave policy.\n\n(8) Salary rates for non-faculty members. Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn “extra service pay” in accordance with the IHE's written policy and paragraph (i)(1)(i).",

          "section_name": "§ 200.431   Compensation—fringe benefits.",
          "content": "§ 200.431   Compensation—fringe benefits.\n(a) General. Fringe benefits are allowances and services employers provide to their employees as compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave, employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefits. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and are required by law, an organization-employee agreement, or an established policy of the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(b) Leave. The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n(1) They are provided under established written leave policies;\n\n(2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and,\n\n(3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently followed by the recipient or subrecipient or a specified grouping of employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) When a recipient or subrecipient uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment and should be allocated as a general administrative expense to all activities or included in the fringe benefit rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a recipient or subrecipient uses the accrual basis of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded.\n\n(c) Fringe benefits. The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated in § 200.447); pension plan costs; and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are permitted under established written policies. The recipient or subrecipient must allocate fringe benefits to Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs following the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting practices.\n\n(d) Cost objectives. The recipient or subrecipient may assign fringe benefits to cost objectives by identifying specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating them based on entity-wide salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made to selective groupings of employees unless the recipient or subrecipient demonstrates that costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.\n\n(e) Insurance. See also § 200.447(d)(1) and (2).\n\n(1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the liabilities for such compensation and the types of coverage, the extent of coverage, and rates and premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability.\n\n(2) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation. The cost of such insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is named as beneficiary.\n\n(3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits (for example, post-retirement health benefits) are allowable in the year of payment provided that the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent costing policy.\n\n(f) Automobiles. That portion of automobile costs furnished by the recipient or subrecipient that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as a fringe benefit or indirect costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.\n\n(g) Pension plan costs. Pension plan costs incurred in accordance with the established written policies of the recipient or subrecipient are allowable, provided that:\n\n(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.\n\n(2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory.\n\n(3) The cost assigned to each fiscal year should be determined in accordance with GAAP, except for State and local governments.\n\n(4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable are unallowable. The recipient or subrecipient may follow the “Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs” (48 CFR 9904.412).\n\n(5) Premiums for pension plan termination insurance that are paid according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable.\n\n(6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.\n\n(i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.\n\n(ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund.\n\n(iii) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.\n\n(iv) When a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP.\n\n(v) Payments for unfunded pension costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded pension costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded pension costs are not allocable to that award.\n\n(vi) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed pension costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.\n\n(h) Post-retirement health. A post-retirement health plan (PRHP) refers to the costs of health insurance or health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.\n\n(1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.\n\n(2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in the current year's PRHP costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund.\n\n(3) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.\n\n(4) If a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an actuarial cost method and funds PRHP costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\n\n(5) Payments for unfunded PRHP costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded PRHP costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded PRHP costs are not allocable to that award.\n\n(6) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to:\n\n(i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums; or\n\n(ii) An insurer or trustee that will maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries.\n\n(7) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.\n\n(i) Severance pay. (1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages, by recipients and subrecipients to workers whose employment is being terminated. Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each case, it is required by:\n\n(i) Law;\n\n(ii) Employer-employee agreement;\n\n(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the recipient's or subrecipient's part; or\n\n(iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.\n\n(2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows:\n\n(i) Actual severance payments for normal turnover must be allocated to all activities; or, where the recipient or subrecipient provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method is acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments made for normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(ii) Measuring the costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual method will not achieve equity for both parties. Therefore, accruals are not allowable. However, the Federal Government recognizes its responsibility to contribute its fair share toward a specific payment. Prior approval by the Federal agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is required.\n\n(3) Costs incurred in severance pay packages that are in excess of the standard severance pay provided by the recipient or subrecipient to an employee upon termination of employment and that are paid to the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the recipient's or subrecipient's assets, are unallowable.\n\n(4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the recipient or subrecipient in the United States, are unallowable unless they are required by applicable foreign law or necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.\n\n(5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or curtailment of activities by, the recipient or subrecipient in that country, are unallowable unless they are either:\n\n(i) Required by applicable foreign law; or\n\n(ii) Necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.\n\n(j) For IHEs only. (1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established written policies of the IHE and are distributed to all IHE activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable.\n\n(2) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees not employed by the IHE are limited to the tax-free amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code as amended (26 U.S.C. 127).\n\n(3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or reductions, provided that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at other institutions according to institutional policy. See § 200.466, for treatment of tuition remission provided to students.\n\n(k) Fringe benefit programs and other benefit costs. (1) For IHEs whose costs are paid by a State or local government, fringe benefit programs (such as pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs incurred specifically on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the IHE, are allowable, subject to the following:\n\n(i) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in §§ 200.402 through 200.411;\n\n(ii) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and\n\n(iii) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.\n\n(2) The allowability of these costs for the IHE does not depend on whether they are recorded in the accounting records of the IHE.\n\n\n\n[89 FR 30136, Apr. 22, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 79732, Oct. 1, 2024]",

Contingency amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events must not be included in the budget estimates for a Federal award.\n\n(b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates to the extent necessary to improve their precision. Contingency amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the Federal agency. As such, contingency amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements of this part (see §§ 200.300 and 200.403), be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the recipient's or subrecipient's records.\n\n(c) Payments to a recipient's or subrecipient's “contingency reserve” or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in §§ 200.431 and 200.447.",

The value of donated services and property may be used to meet cost sharing requirements (see § 200.306). Depreciation on donated assets is permitted so long as the donated property is not counted towards meeting cost sharing requirements (see § 200.436).\n\n(c) Services donated or volunteered to the recipient or subrecipient may be provided by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may not be charged to the Federal award as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services may be used to meet cost sharing requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 200.306.\n\n(d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the recipient or subrecipient will be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services.\n\n(e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to a nonprofit organization and used in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist:\n\n(1) The aggregate value of the services is material;\n\n(2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient;\n\n(i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services rendered, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services.\n\n(ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the project's total costs.

          "content": "§ 200.436   Depreciation.\n(a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. The recipient or subrecipient may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP provided that they are needed and used in the recipient's or subrecipient's activities and correctly allocated to Federal awards. The compensation must be made by computing the proper depreciation.\n\n(b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with Appendices III through IX of this part.\n\n(c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the recipient or subrecipient by a third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as cost sharing but not both. When computing depreciation charges, the acquisition cost will exclude:\n\n(1) The cost of land;\n\n(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where the title was originally vested or is presently located;\n\n(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the recipient or subrecipient that is already claimed as cost sharing or where law or agreement prohibits recovery; and\n\n(4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award.\n\n(d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed:\n\n(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment, technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.\n\n(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be presumed to be the appropriate method. Once used, depreciation methods may not be changed unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect cost rate purposes must be the same methods used by the recipient or subrecipient for its financial statements.\n\n(3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each component may be depreciated over its estimated useful life in this case. The building components must be grouped into three general components: building shell (including construction and design costs), building services systems (for example, elevators, HVAC, and plumbing system), and fixed equipment (for example, sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms, and glassware/washers). A cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize a recipient or subrecipient to use more than these three groupings in exceptional cases. When a recipient or subrecipient elects to depreciate its buildings by their components, the same depreciation method must be used for indirect and financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2).\n\n(4) No depreciation may be allowed on assets that have outlived their depreciable lives.\n\n(5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (meaning, from the date the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation applicable to periods before the conversion from the use allowance method and depreciation after the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset.\n\n(e) Adequate property records must support depreciation charges, and physical inventories must be taken at least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. The recipient or subrecipient may use statistical sampling techniques when taking these inventories. In addition, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain adequate depreciation records showing the amount of depreciation.",

Income generated from these activities must be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.\n\n(c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the recipient's or subrecipient's objective is to operate food services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating objectives other than the above are allowable only when:\n\n(1) The recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and\n\n(2) Approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.",

However, a provision for known or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate used for discounting the liability must be determined by considering factors such as the recipient's or subrecipient's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return.\n\n(2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves.\n\n(3)(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, and other relevant factors or information. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages must normally be limited to the value of claims:\n\n(A) Submitted and adjudicated but not paid;\n\n(B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and\n\n(C) Incurred but not submitted.\n\n(ii) Reserve exceeding the levels described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must be identified and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal.\n\n(4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any significant differences due to the types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured activities or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient. If individual departments or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those differences must be recognized by using separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an equitable allocation.\n\n(5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (for example, general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with the claims collection regulations of the cognizant agency for indirect cost.\n\n(e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received.\n\n(f) Indemnification includes securing the recipient or subrecipient against liabilities to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise.

          "content": "§ 200.449   Interest.\n(a) General. Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of the recipient's or subrecipient's own funds are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the requirements of this section.\n\n(b) Capital assets. (1) Capital assets is defined in § 200.1. An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP.\n\n(2) For recipient or subrecipient fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets include patents and computer software. For software development projects, only interest attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable.\n\n(c) Requirements for all recipients and subrecipients. (1) The recipient or subrecipient uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards;\n\n(2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value available to the recipient or subrecipient from an unrelated (arm's length) third party.\n\n(3) The recipient or subrecipient obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (meaning, a transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate available via such a transaction.\n\n(4) The recipient or subrecipient limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least expensive alternative. For example, a lease contract that transfers ownership by the end of the contract may be determined less costly than purchasing through other types of debt financing, in which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been used.\n\n(5) The recipient or subrecipient expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with GAAP.\n\n(6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under arbitrage requirements are excludable.\n\n(7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct facilities unless the recipient or subrecipient makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 25 percent or more. For this purpose, “initial equity contribution” means the amount or value of contributions made by the recipient or subrecipient for the acquisition of facilities prior to occupancy.\n\n(i) The recipient or subrecipient must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of the facility used for Federal awards.\n\n(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows:\n\n(A) Annually, the recipient or subrecipient must prepare a cumulative (from the project's inception) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the cost of land), and interest payments.\n\n(B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the recipient or subrecipient must divide the above-mentioned annual amounts by the months in the year (usually 12) that the building is in service.\n\n(C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to allowable interest cost. The interest rate to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill closing rate as of the last business day of that month.\n\n(8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable.\n\n(d) Additional requirements for states, local governments and Indian Tribes. For interest costs to be allowable for states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the recipient or subrecipient must have incurred the interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or after September 1, 1995, for land and equipment.\n\n(1) The requirement to offset the interest earned on borrowed funds against allowable interest cost (paragraph (c)(5) of this section) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds.\n\n(2) The recipient or subrecipient must negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, a recipient or subrecipient must consider only cash inflows and outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards.\n\n(e) Additional requirements for IHEs. For interest costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.\n\n(f) Additional requirements for nonprofit organizations. For interest costs to be allowable, the nonprofit organization must have incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.\n\n(g) Requirements for nonprofit organizations subject to full coverage under CAS. The interest allowability provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to “full coverage” under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at 48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The nonprofit organization's Federal awards are instead subject to CAS 414 (48 CFR 9904.414), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital,” and CAS 417 (48 CFR 9904.417), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction.”",

The costs of certain influencing activities associated with obtaining grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or loans are unallowable. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and loans is governed by relevant statutes, including the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, “New Restrictions on Lobbying,” published on February 26, 1990, including definitions, and the Office of Management and Budget “Government-wide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying” and notices published on December 20, 1989, June 15, 1990, January 15, 1992, and January 19, 1996.\n\n(b) Executive lobbying costs. Costs incurred in attempting to improperly influence, either directly or indirectly, an employee or officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter on any basis other than the merit.\n\n(c) Restrictions on nonprofit organizations and IHEs. In addition, the following restrictions apply to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:\n\n(1) Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:\n\n(i) Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, State, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure through in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar activity;\n\n(ii) Establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the expenses of a political party, campaign, political action committee, or other organization established to influence the outcomes of elections in the United States;\n\n(iii) Any attempt to influence:\n\n(A) The introduction of Federal or State legislation;\n\n(B) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or State legislature (including efforts to influence State or local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);\n\n(C) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda or by urging members of the general public, or any segment thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration, march, rally, fundraising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or telephone campaign; or\n\n(D) Any government official or employee in connection with a decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;\n\n(iv) Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.\n\n(2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:\n\n(i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a State legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof), in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the recipient's or subrecipient's member of congress, legislative body, subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings;\n\n(ii) Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to influence State legislation to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the recipient's or subrecipient's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement;\n\n(iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal award; or\n\n(iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of “lobbying” or “influencing legislation” by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct and “grass roots” lobbying activities to retain their charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.) 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:\n\n(A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;\n\n(B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and\n\n(C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as defined by I.R.C. 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1) through (c)(3).\n\n(3) When a recipient or subrecipient seeks reimbursement for indirect costs, total lobbying costs must be identified separately in the indirect cost rate proposal and thereafter be treated as other unallowable activity costs in accordance with § 200.413.\n\n(4) The recipient or subrecipient must submit a certification that the requirements and standards of this section have been complied with as part of its annual indirect cost rate proposal. (See § 200.415.)\n\n(5)(i) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of complying with the record-keeping requirements in § 200.302 with respect to lobbying costs during a particular calendar month when:\n\n(A) The employee engages in lobbying (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section) for 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and\n\n(B) Within the preceding five-year period, the recipient or subrecipient has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying costs.\n\n(ii) When conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, recipients and subrecipients are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time spent by employees during a calendar month.\n\n(iii) In consultation with OMB, the Federal agency must establish procedures for resolving, in advance, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or recipient or subrecipient from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.",

          "content": "§ 200.464   Relocation costs of employees.\n(a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:\n\n(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.\n\n(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.\n\n(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.\n\n(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:\n\n(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of their immediate family and their household, and personal effects to the new location.\n\n(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to a maximum period of 30 calendar days.\n\n(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incidental to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, are limited to eight percent of the sales price of the employee's former home.\n\n(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.\n\n(5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as canceling an unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the monthly rental.\n\n(c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of the cost. If a new employee is relocating to an overseas location and dependents are not permitted for any reason, and the costs do not include transporting household goods, the costs must be considered travel costs in accordance with § 200.474, not relocation costs under this section.\n\n(d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable:\n\n(1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home.\n\n(2) A loss on the sale of a former home.\n\n(3) Continuing mortgage principal and interest payments on a home being sold.\n\n(4) Income taxes paid by an employee related to reimbursed relocation costs.",

Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed and if other options are available.\n\n(b) Rental costs under “sale and lease back” arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had continued to own the property. This amount would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.\n\n(c) Rental costs under “less-than-arm's-length” leases are allowable only up to the amount described in paragraph (b) of this section. For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party to the lease agreement can control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to, those between:\n\n(1) Divisions of the recipient or subrecipient;\n\n(2) The recipient or subrecipient and another entity under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and\n\n(3) The recipient or subrecipient and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the recipient or subrecipient or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the recipient or subrecipient may establish a separate corporation to own property and lease it back to the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n(4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party:\n\n(i) Spouse and parents thereof;\n\n(ii) Children and spouses thereof;\n\n(iii) Parents and spouses thereof;\n\n(iv) Siblings and spouses thereof;\n\n(v) Grandparents and grandchildren and spouses thereof;\n\n(vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 through 5 of this definition; and\n\n(vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.\n\n(d) Rental costs under leases which are required to be accounted for as a financed purchase under GASB standards or a finance lease under FASB standards are allowable only up to the amount (described in paragraph (b) of this section) that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. Interest costs related to these leases are allowable if they meet the criteria in § 200.449. Unallowable costs include costs that would not have been incurred if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property, such as amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes.\n\n(e) Rental or lease payments are allowable under lease contracts where the recipient or subrecipient is required to recognize an intangible right-to-use lease asset under GASB standards or right-of-use operating lease asset under FASB standards for purposes of financial reporting in accordance with GAAP.\n\n(f) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient, including commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office is unallowable.",

In cases where the costs are credited back to the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may reduce the Federal share of costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, the Federal agency may allow the recipient or subrecipient to use the foreign government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award.",

          "content": "§ 200.472   Termination and standard closeout costs.\n(a) Termination Costs. Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs or the need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They must be used in conjunction with the other termination requirements of this part.\n\n(1) The cost of items reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work is unallowable unless the recipient or subrecipient submits evidence that it would not retain such items without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the recipient or subrecipient, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should consider the recipient's or subrecipient's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the recipient or subrecipient must be considered evidence that the items are reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order do not exceed the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.\n\n(2) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot discontinue certain costs immediately after the effective termination date, despite making all reasonable efforts, then the costs are generally allowable within the limitations of this part. Any costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the recipient or subrecipient to immediately discontinue the costs are unallowable.\n\n(3) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if:\n\n(i) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the recipient or subrecipient;\n\n(ii) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the Federal agency (see § 200.313 (d)); and\n\n(iii) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to the portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired.\n\n(4) If paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (ii) below are satisfied, rental costs under unexpired leases (less the residual value of such leases) are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award. These rental costs may include the cost of alterations of the leased property and the cost of reasonable restoration required by the lease, provided the alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award.\n\n(i) The amount of claimed rental costs does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and a further period as may be reasonable; and\n\n(ii) The recipient or subrecipient makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of the lease.\n\n(5) The following settlement expenses are generally allowable.\n\n(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs that are reasonably necessary for:\n\n(A) The preparation and presentation to the Federal agency or pass-through entity of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see §§ 200.339-200.343); and\n\n(B) The termination and settlement of subawards.\n\n(ii) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award.\n\n(6) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims common to the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with contractors and subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is consistent with the requirements of § 200.414. These allocated indirect costs must exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.\n\n(b) Closeout Costs. Administrative costs associated with the closeout activities of a Federal award are allowable. The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during the closeout for the necessary administrative costs of that Federal award (for example, salaries of personnel preparing final reports, publication and printing costs, costs associated with the disposition of equipment and property, and related indirect costs). These costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency.",

Travel costs include the transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the recipient or subrecipient. These costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip. The method used must be consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the recipient's or subrecipient's other activities and in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 200.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity when they are specifically related to the Federal award.\n\n(b) Lodging and subsistence. Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the recipient or subrecipient in its regular operations as the result of the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy. In addition, if these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that:\n\n(1) Participation of the individual is necessary for the Federal award; and\n\n(2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy.\n\n(c) Dependents. (1) Temporary dependent care costs (dependent is defined in 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular dependent care are allowable provided that these costs:\n\n(i) Are a direct result of the individual's travel to a conference for the Federal award;\n\n(ii) Are consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy for all travel; and\n\n(iii) Are only temporary during the travel period.\n\n(2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of six months or more with prior approval of the Federal agency. See § 200.432.\n\n(d) Establishing rates and amounts. In the absence of an established written policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11 (“Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances”), by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or their designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)).\n\n(e) Commercial air travel. (1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would:\n\n(i) Require circuitous routing;\n\n(ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours;\n\n(iii) Excessively prolong travel;\n\n(iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or\n\n(v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The recipient or subrecipient must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis for the use of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases.\n\n(2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a recipient's or subrecipient's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare is unavailable for specific trips if the recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate that such airfare was not available in the specific case.\n\n(f) Air travel by other than commercial carrier. Travel costs by recipient or subrecipient-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft include the cost of the lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of these costs that exceeds the cost of airfare, as provided for in paragraph (d), is unallowable.",

A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.\n\n(b) Single audit. A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more in Federal awards during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year must have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 200.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.\n\n(c) Program-specific audit election (in general). A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with § 200.507 if the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding research and development); and\n\n(2) The Federal program's statutes or regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, do not require a financial statement audit of the non-Federal entity.\n\n(d) Program-specific audit election for research and development. A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit for research and development conducted in accordance with § 200.507, but only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards only from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity; and\n\n(2) The Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves a program-specific audit in advance.\n\n(e) Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $1,000,000. A non-Federal entity that expends less than $1,000,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 200.503. However, in all instances, the records of the non-Federal entity must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\n(f) Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.\n\n(g) Subrecipients and contractors. An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Unless a program is exempt by Federal statute, Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. Payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor under a Federal award (see § 200.331) are not subject to audit under this part.\n\n(h) Compliance responsibility for contractors. In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not flow down to contractors. However, for procurement transactions in which the contractor is made responsible for meeting program requirements, the auditee must ensure those requirements are met, including by clearly stating the contractor's responsibilities within the contract and reviewing the contractor's records to determine compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include a determination of whether these transactions comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. See also § 200.318(b).\n\n(i) For-profit subrecipient. This subpart does not apply to for-profit organizations. As necessary, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The subaward with a for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring throughout the performance of the subaward, and post-award audits (see § 200.332).",

          "content": "§ 200.502   Basis for determining Federal awards expended.\n(a) Determining Federal awards expended. The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity related to the Federal award pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as:\n\n(1) Expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cooperative agreements, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, and direct appropriations;\n\n(2) The disbursement of funds to subrecipients;\n\n(3) The use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs;\n\n(4) The receipt of property (including surplus property);\n\n(5) The receipt or use of program income;\n\n(6) The distribution or use of food commodities;\n\n(7) The disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and\n\n(8) The period when insurance is in force.\n\n(b) Loan and loan guarantees (loans). The Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid. Therefore, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs (except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d)):\n\n(1) The value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus\n\n(2) The balance of loans from previous years at the beginning of the audit period for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus\n\n(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.\n\n(c) Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at Institutions of Higher Education (IHE). When loans are made to students of an IHE, but the IHE itself does not have continuing compliance requirements for the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period are considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.\n\n(d) Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans). Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.\n\n(e) Endowment funds. The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted is considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.\n\n(f) Free rent. Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in determining Federal awards expended and is subject to audit under this part.\n\n(g) Valuing non-cash assistance. Federal non-cash assistance (such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property that is received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program) must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency and must be included in determining Federal awards expended under this part.\n\n(h) Medicare. Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.\n\n(i) Medicaid. Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.\n\n(j) Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration. For purposes of this part, loans from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended.",

          "content": "§ 200.503   Relation to other audit requirements.\n(a) Other financial audits. An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such an audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and use that information.\n\n(b) Conducting additional audits. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a Federal agency, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange additional audits to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency must plan such audits not to be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed by other auditors.\n\n(c) Authority to conduct additional audits. The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal officials. For example, requirements that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies.\n\n(d) Federal agency to pay for additional audits. A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.\n\n(e) Request for a program to be audited as a major program. A Federal agency may request that an auditee have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. Such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited to allow for planning. After consultation with its auditor, the auditee should promptly respond to such a request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in § 200.518 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. With approval of the Federal agency, a pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.",

In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor concerning internal controls, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found in the compliance supplement (Appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides). When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.\n\n(b) Program-specific audit guide not available. (1) When a current program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.\n\n(2) The auditee must prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(c).\n\n(3) The auditor must:\n\n(i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS;\n\n(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the Federal program consistent with the requirements for a major program in accordance with§ 200.514(c);\n\n(iii) Determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements for a major program under § 200.514(d);\n\n(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings and perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511 When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must report this condition as a current-year audit finding.; and\n\n(v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.516.\n\n(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:\n\n(i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;\n\n(ii) A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which must describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;\n\n(iii) A report on compliance that includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and\n\n(iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with § 200.515(d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of § 200.515(d)(3).\n\n(c) Report submission for program-specific audits. (1) Submission deadline and public availability. The audit must be completed and submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. Unless a different period is specified in the program-specific audit guide, the audit must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period (whichever is earlier). The submission is due the next business day when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.\n\n(2) Program-specific audit guide available. When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee must electronically submit the data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b), as applicable to the program-specific audit, to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The submission must also include the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide.\n\n(3) Program-specific audit guide not available. When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee must electronically submit the data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b) to the FAC.

The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 200.516(c).

When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total expenditures (as direct and subawards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated cognizant agency for audit.\n\n(2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years ending in 2019 and every fifth year after that.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding how audit cognizance is determined, a Federal agency may reassign cognizance to another Federal agency that provides substantial funding to an auditee if it agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit must notify the FAC, the auditee, and the auditor (if known) of the change.\n\n(4) The cognizant agency for audit must:\n\n(i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors.\n\n(ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors and provide the results to other interested organizations.\n\n(iii) Cooperate and support the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a government-wide analysis to assess the quality of single audits. The government-wide analysis may rely on the current and ongoing quality control review work performed by Federal agencies, State auditors, and professional audit associations. This government-wide audit analysis must be performed at an interval determined by OMB, and the results must be posted publicly. In providing support to the government-wide analysis, a Federal agency must provide the following:\n\n(A) An assessment of the extent to which single audits conform to the requirements, standards, and procedures of this part; and\n\n(B) Recommendations to address audit quality issues, including recommendations for any changes to this part's requirements, standards, and procedures.\n\n(iv) Promptly inform the appropriate Federal law enforcement officials and impacted Federal agencies of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS, Federal statute, or regulation.\n\n(v) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies.\n\n(vi) Advise the auditor, Federal awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.\n\n(vii) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon, rather than duplicate, audits performed in accordance with this part.\n\n(viii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal agency whose awards are included in the audit finding of the auditee. Cross-cutting audit finding means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity); for example, a cross-cutting audit finding may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.\n\n(ix) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.\n\n(x) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal year.\n\n(b) Oversight agency for audit responsibilities. An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with § 200.1 oversight agency for audit. A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to another Federal agency that agrees to be the oversight agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit:\n\n(1) Must provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.\n\n(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.\n\n(c) Awarding Federal agency responsibilities. In addition to all other requirements of this part, the awarding Federal agency must:\n\n(1) Ensure that audits are completed, and reports are received in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of this part.\n\n(2) Provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.\n\n(3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that non-Federal entities take appropriate and timely corrective action. Follow-up includes:\n\n(i) Issuing a management decision in accordance with § 200.521;\n\n(ii) Monitoring the non-Federal entity's progress implementing a corrective action;\n\n(iii) Using a cooperative audit resolution approach to improve Federal program outcomes through better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action, which means the use of audit follow-up techniques promoting prompt corrective action by improving communication, fostering collaboration, promoting trust, and developing an understanding between the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This approach is based upon:\n\n(A) A strong commitment by Federal agency and non-Federal entity leadership to Federal program integrity;\n\n(B) Federal agencies strengthening partnerships and working cooperatively with non-Federal entities and their auditors; non-Federal entities and their auditors working cooperatively with Federal agencies;\n\n(C) A focus on current conditions and corrective action going forward;\n\n(D) Federal agencies offering appropriate relief for past noncompliance when audits show prompt corrective action has occurred; and\n\n(E) Federal agency leadership sending a clear message that continued failure to correct conditions identified by audits likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, or abuse is unacceptable and will result in sanctions.\n\n(iv) Tracking the effectiveness of the Federal agency's follow-up processes, the effectiveness of single audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability, and the use of single audits in making Federal award decisions. The Federal agency should develop a baseline, metrics, and targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow up on audit findings.\n\n(4) Provide OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement. These updates include working with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor on testing the compliance requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse, or generate audit findings for which the Federal agency will take action in accordance with § 200.505. Prior to submitting compliance supplement drafts to OMB, Federal agencies should engage with external audit stakeholders, the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General, and the National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).\n\n(5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy officials of the Federal agency. The accountable official must be:\n\n(i) Responsible for ensuring that the Federal agency fulfills the requirements of this section and effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal program outcomes.\n\n(ii) Accountable for improving the effectiveness of the Federal agency's single audit processes in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv).\n\n(iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison.\n\n(6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison. The liaison must:\n\n(i) Serve as the Federal agency's point of contact for the single audit process within and outside the Federal Government.\n\n(ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and information sharing. This includes coordinating audit follow-up, identifying higher risk non-Federal entities, providing input on single audit and follow-up policy, enhancing the utility of the FAC, and identifying ways to use single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices.\n\n(iii) Oversee training for the Federal agency's program management personnel related to the single audit process.\n\n(iv) Promote the Federal agency's use of a cooperative audit resolution approach as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.\n\n(v) Coordinate the Federal agency's audit follow-up processes and ensure non-Federal entities implement corrective actions for audit findings.\n\n(vi) Ensure the Federal agency fulfills its responsibility, as a cognizant agency for audit, to coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings under (a)(4)(viii) of this section. Cross-cutting audit findings means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity). For example, this may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.\n\n(vii) Ensure the Federal agency provides OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement consistent with the compliance supplement preparation guide.\n\n(viii) Support the mission of the Federal agency's single audit accountable official and coordinate with the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General and National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).",

The audit must also cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during the audit period. In these instances, the audit must include the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period.\n\n(b) Financial statements. The auditor must determine whether the auditee's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.\n\n(c) Internal control. (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.\n\n(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:\n\n(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and\n\n(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.\n\n(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 200.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.\n\n(d) Compliance. (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.\n\n(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.\n\n(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements, and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included.\n\n(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions or other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.\n\n(e) Audit follow-up. The auditor must follow up on prior audit findings regardless of whether a prior audit finding is related to a major program in the current year. Audit follow-up includes performing procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511. When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must report this condition as a current-year audit finding.\n\n(f) Data collection form. As required in § 200.512(b)(4), the auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.",

The auditor must also decide whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.\n\n(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of internal control and compliance testing and the results of the tests. Where applicable, the report must refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance.

The auditor must report the following as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs:\n\n(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or a material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.\n\n(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.\n\n(3) Known questioned costs when either known or likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. When reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.\n\n(4) Known questioned costs greater than $25,000 for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (for example, as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, the auditor must report this as an audit finding.\n\n(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is other than an unmodified opinion. This must be included unless the circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs.\n\n(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless the fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. This paragraph does not require the auditor to publicly report information that could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.\n\n(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 200.511(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.\n\n(b) Audit finding detail and clarity. Audit findings must be presented with sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies or pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. As applicable, the following information must be included in audit findings:\n\n(1) The Federal program and specific Federal award identification, including the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, the name of the Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the Assistance Listings title and number or Federal award identification number, is unavailable, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.\n\n(2) The criteria or specific requirement for the audit finding (for example, the specific Federal statute, regulation, or term and condition of the Federal award). The criteria or specific requirement provides a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings. The criteria should generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation.\n\n(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.\n\n(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action\n\n(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency or pass-through entity to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.\n\n(6) The identification of known questioned costs, by applicable Assistance Listing number(s) and Federal award identification number(s), and how these questioned costs were computed.\n\n(7) When there are known questioned costs but the dollar amount is undetermined or not reported, a description of why the dollar amount was undetermined or otherwise could not be reported.\n\n(8) Information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the audit finding. For example, whether the audit finding represents an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. In addition, the audit finding should indicate whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.\n\n(9) The identification of whether the audit finding is a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit. The audit finding must identify the applicable prior year audit finding reference numbers in these instances.\n\n(10) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.\n\n(11) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.\n\n(c) Reference numbers.

          "content": "§ 200.518   Major program determination.\n(a) General. The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach must consider current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process described in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section must be followed.\n\n(b) Step one. (1) The auditor must identify and label the larger Federal programs as Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the levels outlined in table 1:\n\nTable 1 to Paragraph (b)(1)\nTotal Federal awards expended\nType A threshold\nEqual to or exceed $1,000,000 but less than or equal to $34 million$1,000,000.\nExceed $34 million but less than or equal to $100 millionTotal Federal awards expended times .03.\nExceed $100 million but less than or equal to $1 billion$3 million.\nExceed $1 billion but less than or equal to $10 billionTotal Federal awards expended times .003.\nExceed $10 billion but less than or equal to $20 billion$30 million.\nExceed $20 billionTotal Federal awards expended times .0015.\n(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be labeled Type B programs.\n\n(3) Including large loans and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. A Federal program providing loans is considered a large loan program when it exceeds four times the largest non-loan program. The auditor must identify each large loan program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For this paragraph, a program is only considered a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal awards expended for loans within the program comprises 50 percent or more of the total Federal awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program, and the value of Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in § 200.502.\n\n(4) For biennial audits (see § 200.504), the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based on the Federal awards expended during the two-year audit period.\n\n(c) Step two. (1) The auditor must identify Type A programs that are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor must consider whether the requirements in § 200.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and preclude the program from being low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the program must not have had:\n\n(i) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);\n\n(ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or\n\n(iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for the program.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal agency request that a Type A program not be considered low-risk for a specific recipient. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year for a particular recipient for the Federal agency to comply with 31 U.S.C. 3515. The Federal agency must notify the auditee and, if known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited.\n\n(d) Step three. (1) The auditor must identify high-risk Type B programs using professional judgment and the criteria in § 200.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at least one-fourth of the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under step two. Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 200.519(b)(1), (2), and (c)(1), a single criterion in risk would rarely cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to assess for risk, the auditor is encouraged to use an approach that provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major programs over a period of time.\n\n(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed 25 percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in step one.\n\n(e) Step four. At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs:\n\n(1) All Type A programs not identified as low-risk under step two.\n\n(2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three.\n\n(3) Additional programs as necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule described in paragraph (f). This rule may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the number of Type A programs.\n\n(f) Percentage of coverage rule. When the auditee meets the criteria in § 200.520, the auditor only needs to audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) of total Federal awards expended.\n\n(g) Documentation of risk. The auditor must include in the audit documentation the risk analysis used for determining major programs.\n\n(h) Auditor's judgment. The auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs must be presumed correct when the determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part. Challenges by a Federal agency or pass-through entity must only be for clearly improper use of the requirements in this part. However, a Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program. The auditor must consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.",

Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.\n\n(b) Current and prior audit experience. (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Therefore, consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs. This includes considering factors such as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.\n\n(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (for example, one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.\n\n(ii) A weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk when significant parts of a Federal program are passed to subrecipients through subawards.\n\n(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, especially when the situations identified in the audit findings could significantly impact a Federal program or have not been corrected.\n\n(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than those recently audited as major programs without audit findings.\n\n(c) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities. (1) The oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities may be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.\n\n(2) With the concurrence of OMB, a Federal agency may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will identify these Federal programs in the compliance supplement.\n\n(d) Inherent risk of the Federal program. (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third-party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may be at high risk for noncompliance with the requirements of § 200.430 but otherwise be at low risk.\n\n(2) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.\n\n(3) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to the start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.\n\n(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.",

The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements, which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.\n\n(b) Federal agency. The cognizant agency for audit is responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency (see § 200.513(a)(4)(viii)). The awarding Federal agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect the Federal awards it makes to a non-Federal entity (see § 200.513(c)(3)(i)).\n\n(c) Pass-through entity. The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect subawards it issues to subrecipients under a Federal award (see § 200.332(e)).\n\n(d) Time requirements. The Federal agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within six months of the FAC's acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.\n\n(e) Reference numbers.

          "content": "§ 415.1   Administrative standards for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements.\n(a) All USDA awarding agencies must demonstrate a commitment to encouraging free and open competition in all discretionary grant and cooperative agreement funding opportunities. USDA awarding agencies must ensure that all eligible applications for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements receive fair and impartial review, be evaluated only on criteria as stated in the respective notice of funding opportunity, and that no applicant receive an unfair advantage.\n\n(b) USDA awarding agencies must enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by USDA awarding agencies where expressly provided by statute, when directed by Congress, where the requirement is determined to be inconsistent with international assistance objectives of USDA, or as specified in paragraph (d) of this section or as approved by the Secretary and OMB under paragraph (e). A USDA awarding agency's competitive award process must adhere to the following standards:\n\n(1) All notices of funding opportunities for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements must be published on Grants.gov as described in 2 CFR 200.204(a). When notices of funding opportunities contain an information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) or its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320, USDA awarding agencies must seek and obtain OMB approval before collecting information from the public.\n\n(i) Supplementary to the requirements at paragraph (b)(1), USDA awarding agencies may make use of other methods of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities. In doing so, USDA awarding agencies must:\n\n(A) Pursue the broadest dissemination of information concerning notices of funding opportunities in order to reach the greatest number and diversity of potential applicants.\n\n(B) Avoid any appearance that an unfair advantage has been provided to any entity, inclusive of the memberships or networks of such entities, which may arise from the use of any dissemination method.\n\n(C) Provide only public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.\n\n(D) Seek the greatest cost savings to the Government, whenever possible.\n\n(ii) Nothing in this part will be interpreted as to limit, impede, or otherwise prevent the attendance of any USDA awarding agency's staff, acting in their official capacity, at a conference, event, or similar activity, for the purposes of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.\n\n(2) Applications must be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with evaluation criteria set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency. USDA awarding agencies must establish written procedures to gain reasonable assurance that individuals selected to serve as independent reviewers are qualified to conduct any assigned review activity and that applications are scored by independent reviewers solely on the basis of criteria announced in the respective published notice of funding opportunity. Independent reviewers must make written comments or make a written determination of scoring, as appropriate, concerning each application to which they are assigned.\n\n(i) Independent reviewers may be from the private or public sector, including another Federal agency, or within the awarding agency. Independent reviewers must not be any individual who holds or has been delegated approval or award authority for the applications being reviewed or components thereof.\n\n(ii) Anyone who has or might appear to have a conflict of interest with any element of an application considered for selection or funding will be ineligible to serve as an independent reviewer. A conflict of interest might arise when the prospective independent reviewer, the reviewer's immediate family members, or the reviewer's partner, have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial or other interest in or tangible personal benefit from the applicant or applicant organizations; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), unless directed by Congress or authorized by statute, USDA awarding agencies may, but are not required to, review, evaluate for eligibility, or otherwise consider for funding any unsolicited application, proposal materials, ideas, pitches, or any other request for Federal funds provided by any entity for the purpose of obtaining Federal financial assistance.\n\n(c) The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding official in each USDA awarding agency. The awarding official must consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the respective independent reviewers, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the awarding decision must be handled by the awarding agency using existing, written agency appeal procedures.\n\n(d) The awarding official may make a determination that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination must be made in writing on a case-by-case basis and be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of USDA. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards are:\n\n(1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services.\n\n(2) Awards of less than $100,000.\n\n(3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award for which competition for continued support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.\n\n(4) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare, or national security requirement preclude competition.\n\n(e) USDA awarding agencies may establish alternate exceptions from competition for discretionary awards. All such alternative exceptions will be subject to review and approval both by the Secretary and by OMB, pursuant to pursuant to 2 CFR 200.102, and 2 CFR 200.107 when applicable, and publicly set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency.\n\n(f) All actions taken USDA awarding agencies for the purpose of accomplishing any element of Federal financial assistance programs, awards, and any related or subsequent transactions, must comply with the direction set forth in Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01 and successor policy regarding the performance of inherently governmental and critical functions.",

          "content": "§ 417.222   How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's export credit guarantee and direct credit programs apply?\n(a) Export credit guarantee program. In the case of the export credit guarantee program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the guarantee issued by the USDA to a U.S. exporter. The U.S. exporter usually assigns the guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, and this would create another primary tier covered transaction between USDA and the U.S. financial institution. USDA would have to check the SAM.gov before issuing a guarantee or accepting a guarantee assignment to ensure that the U.S. exporter or financial institution that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank to the U.S. exporter to pay on behalf of the importer for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the guarantee. Similarly, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank under an instrument, such as a loan agreement or letter of credit, to the U.S. financial institution assigned the guarantee, which has paid the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities and, in so doing, issued a loan to the foreign bank, which the foreign bank is obligated to repay on deferred payment terms. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), these nonprocurement transactions would not be covered transactions. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a procurement contract (i.e., a contract for the purchase and sale of goods) that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the guarantee. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. exporter or U.S. financial institution would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or foreign bank or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the SAM.gov as excluded or disqualified.\n\n(b) Direct credit program. In the case of the direct credit program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the financing agreement between the USDA and the U.S. exporter. USDA purchases the exporter's account receivable in a particular transaction pursuant to the financing agreement. On occasion, such a transaction may contemplate a payment obligation of a U.S. or foreign bank to make the required payments. USDA would have to check SAM.gov before entering into a financing agreement or accepting such a payor to ensure that the U.S. exporter or the bank, if any, that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of the importer to pay the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction.

An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.\n\n(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency will consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.\n\n(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section will be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons will be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.\n\n(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.",

Apparently successful applicant status confers no right and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award, which still must be executed by the Agreement Officer.\n\nAward has the same meaning as Federal award as defined in 2 CFR 200.1.\n\nCommodities mean any material, article, supply, goods or equipment, excluding recipient offices, vehicles, and non-deliverable items for recipient's internal use in administration of the USAID-funded grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement or subaward.\n\nEnd date means the date on which the recipient or subrecipient completes all work under an award or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment, on which USAID sponsorship ends.\n\nProgram means the organized set of activities directed toward a common purpose, objective, or goal that a recipient or subrecipient undertakes or proposes.\n\nSuspension means an action by USAID that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to resume or terminate the award. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under USAID regulations implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” See 2 CFR part 780.\n\nUSAID means the United States Agency for International Development.",

          "section_name": "§ 700.16   Marking.",
          "content": "§ 700.16   Marking.\n(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1) Activity means a set of a recipient or subrecipient's actions using resources—such as commodities, technical assistance, or training to produce specific results, such as vaccinations given, schools built, microenterprise loans issued, or policies changed. The recipient or subrecipient undertakes activities to achieve the formally approved objectives of the award.\n\n(2) Branding strategy means a strategy the apparently successful applicant or recipient submits describing how they will name and position the program, project, or activity and how they will promote and communicate it to beneficiaries and cooperating country citizens. In the branding strategy, the apparently successful applicant or recipient identifies all donors and explains how they will be acknowledged.\n\n(3) Marking plan means a plan that the apparently successful applicant or recipient submits after merit review of an application for USAID funding, detailing the public communications, commodities, and program materials and other items that will visibly bear the USAID Identity.\n\n(4) Public communications are documents and messages the recipient or subrecipient intends to distribute to external audiences. They include, but are not limited to, correspondence, publications, studies, reports, audio-visual productions, and other informational products; applications, forms, press and promotional materials used in connection with USAID-funded programs, projects or activities, including signage and plaques; websites/internet activities; and events such as training courses, conferences, seminars, and press conferences.\n\n(5) USAID Identity (Identity) means the official marking for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) comprised of the USAID logo or seal and new brandmark with the tagline that clearly communicates our assistance is “from the American people.” Upon a written determination by the USAID Administrator, or delegate, the definition of the USAID Identity may be amended to include additional or substitute use of a logo or seal and tagline representing a presidential initiative or other high level interagency Federal initiative that requires consistent and uniform branding and marking by all participating agencies. The USAID Identity (including any required additional insignia or related identity) is available on the USAID website at https://www.usaid.gov/branding and is provided without royalty, license or other fee to recipients of USAID funded grants or cooperative agreements or other assistance awards.\n\n(6) Principal officer means the most senior officer in an USAID Operating Unit in the field, for example, a USAID Mission Director or USAID Representative. For global programs managed from Washington but executed across many countries, such as disaster relief programs and assistance to internally displaced persons, humanitarian emergencies or immediate post conflict and political crisis responses, the cognizant Principal Officer may be an Office Director, for example, the Directors of USAID/W/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Office of Transition Initiatives. For non-presence countries, the cognizant Principal Officer is the Senior USAID officer in a regional USAID Operating Unit responsible for the non-presence country, or in the absence of such a responsible operating unit, the Principal U.S Diplomatic Officer in the non-presence country exercising delegated authority from USAID.\n\n(b) USAID policy is that a recipient or subrecipient must mark all programs, projects, activities, public communications, and commodities, specified further at paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, partially or fully funded by a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward with the USAID Identity, of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, other donor's or any other third party's identity or logo.\n\n(1) USAID reserves the right to require the USAID Identity to be larger and more prominent if it is the majority donor, or to require that a cooperating country government's identity be larger and more prominent if circumstances warrant; any such requirement will be on a case-by-case basis depending on the audience, program goals and materials produced.\n\n(2) USAID reserves the right to request pre-production review of USAID funded public communications and program materials for compliance with the approved Marking Plan.\n\n(3) USAID reserves the right to require marking with the USAID Identity in the event the recipient does not choose to mark with its own identity or logo.\n\n(4) Recipients of USAID funded grants and cooperative agreements or other assistance awards must include a USAID-approved marking provision in any USAID funded subaward, to read as follows:\n\n\nAs a condition of receipt of this subaward, marking with the USAID Identity of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, subrecipient's, other donor's or third party's is required. In the event the recipient chooses not to require marking with its own identity or logo by the subrecipient, USAID may, at its discretion, require marking by the subrecipient with the USAID Identity.\n(c) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark program, project, or activity sites funded by USAID, including visible infrastructure projects (for example, roads, bridges, buildings) or other programs, projects, or activities that are physical in nature (for example, agriculture, forestry, water management), with the USAID Identity. The recipient or subrecipient should erect temporary signs or plaques early in the construction or implementation phase. When construction or implementation is complete, the recipient or subrecipient must install a permanent, durable sign, plaque or other marking.\n\n(d) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark technical assistance, studies, reports, papers, publications, audio-visual productions, public service announcements, websites/internet activities and other promotional, informational, media, or communications products funded by USAID with the USAID Identity.\n\n(1) Any “public communications” as defined in § 700.1, funded by USAID, in which the content has not been approved by USAID, must contain the following disclaimer:\n\n\nThis study/report/audio/visual/other information/media product (specify) is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The contents are the responsibility of [insert recipient name] and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government.\n(2) The recipient must provide the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) or other USAID personnel designated in the grant or cooperative agreement with at least two copies of all program and communications materials produced under the award. In addition, the recipient must submit one electronic and/or one hard copy of all final documents to USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse.\n\n(e) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark events financed by USAID such as training courses, conferences, seminars, exhibitions, fairs, workshops, press conferences and other public activities, with the USAID Identity. Unless directly prohibited and as appropriate to the surroundings, recipients should display additional materials such as signs and banners with the USAID Identity. In circumstances in which the USAID Identity cannot be displayed visually, recipients should otherwise acknowledge USAID and the American people's support.\n\n(f) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark all commodities financed by USAID, including commodities or equipment provided under humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, and all other equipment, supplies and other materials funded by USAID, and their export packaging, with the USAID Identity.\n\n(g) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Branding Strategy, defined in § 700.1. The proposed Branding Strategy will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review the proposed Branding Strategy for adequacy, and will negotiate, approve and include the Branding Strategy in the award. The Agreement Officer will specify the timeline for submission in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. If the Notice of Funding Opportunity indicates that the apparently successful applicant may submit a Branding Strategy after the award is made, the Agreement Officer must include a special award condition to indicate the required submission date. If the Agreement Officer requires submission before award, failure to submit or negotiate a Branding Strategy within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award.\n\n(h) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Marking Plan, defined in § 700.1. The Marking Plan may include requests for approval of Presumptive Exceptions, paragraph (i) of this section. The apparently successful applicant must include all estimated costs associated with branding and marking USAID programs, such as plaques, labels, banners, press events, promotional materials, and the like, in the total cost estimate of the grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award. These costs are subject to revision and negotiation with the Agreement Officer upon submission of the Marking Plan. The Marking Plan will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review the proposed Marking Plan for adequacy, and will negotiate, approve and include the Marking Plan in the award. The Agreement Officer will specify the timeline for submission in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. If the Notice of Funding Opportunity indicates that the apparently successful applicant may submit a Marking Plan after the award is made, the Agreement Officer must include a special award condition to indicate the required submission date. If the Agreement Officer requires submission before award, failure to submit or negotiate a Marking Plan within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award. Agreement Officers have the discretion to suspend the implementation requirements of the Marking Plan if circumstances warrant. Recipients of a USAID funded grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward should retain copies of any specific marking instructions or waivers in their project, program or activity files.\n\n(i) Presumptive exceptions:\n\n(1) The above marking requirements in § 700.16(b) through (f) may not apply if marking would:\n\n(i) Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program or materials where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of the program and materials, such as election monitoring or ballots, and voter information literature; political party support or public policy advocacy or reform; independent media, such as television and radio broadcasts, newspaper articles and editorials; public service announcements or public opinion polls and surveys.\n\n(ii) Diminish the credibility of audits, reports, analyses, studies, or policy recommendations whose data or findings must be seen as independent.\n\n(iii) Undercut host-country government “ownership” of constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, studies, assessments, reports, publications, surveys or audits, public service announcements, or other communications better positioned as “by” or “from” a cooperating country ministry or government official.\n\n(iv) Impair the functionality of an item, such as sterilized equipment or spare parts.\n\n(v) Incur substantial costs or be impractical, such as items too small or other otherwise unsuited for individual marking, such as food in bulk.\n\n(vi) Offend local cultural or social norms, or be considered inappropriate on such items as condoms, toilets, bed pans, or similar commodities.\n\n(vii) Conflict with international law.\n\n(2) The Agreement Officer must approve these exceptions. Apparently successful applicants may request approval of one or more of the presumptive exceptions, depending on the circumstances, in their Marking Plan. The Agreement Officer will review requests for presumptive exceptions for adequacy, along with the rest of the Marking Plan. When reviewing a request for approval of a presumptive exception, the Agreement Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID identity is removed. Exceptions approved will apply to subrecipients unless otherwise provided by USAID.\n\n(j) In cases where the recipient does not comply with the Marking Plan, the Agreement Officer will initiate corrective action. Such action may involve informing the recipient of a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward of instances of noncompliance and requesting that the recipient carry out its responsibilities as set forth in the Marking Plan and award. Major or repeated non compliance with the Marking Plan will be governed by the uniform suspension and termination procedures set forth at 2 CFR 200.340 through 2 CFR 200.343, and 2 CFR 700.14.\n\n(k)(1) Waivers. USAID Principal Officers may at any time after award waive in whole or in part the USAID approved Marking Plan, including USAID marking requirements for each USAID funded program, project, activity, public communication or commodity, or in exceptional circumstances may make a waiver by region or country, if the Principal Officer determines that otherwise USAID required marking would pose compelling political, safety, or security concerns, or marking would have an adverse impact in the cooperating country. USAID recipients may request waivers of the Marking Plan in whole or in part, through the AOR. No marking is required while a waiver determination is pending. The Principal Officer must make the waiver determination on safety or security grounds in consultation with U.S. Government security personnel if available, and must consider the same information that applies to determinations of the safety and security of U.S. Government employees in the cooperating country, as well as any information supplied by the AOR or the recipient for whom the waiver is sought. When reviewing a request for approval of a waiver, the Principal Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID Identity is removed. Approved waivers are not limited in duration but are subject to Principal Officer review at any time due to changed circumstances. Approved waivers “flow down” to recipients of subawards unless specified otherwise. Principal Officers may also authorize the removal of USAID markings already affixed if circumstances warrant. Principal Officers' determinations regarding waiver requests are subject to appeal to the Principal Officer's cognizant Assistant Administrator. Recipients may appeal by submitting a written request to reconsider the Principal Officer's waiver determination to the cognizant Assistant Administrator.\n\n(2) Non-retroactivity. Marking requirements apply to any obligation of USAID funds for new awards as of January 2, 2006. Marking requirements also will apply to new obligations under existing awards, such as incremental funding actions, as of January 2, 2006, when the total estimated cost of the existing award has been increased by USAID or the scope of effort is changed to accommodate any costs associated with marking. In the event a waiver is rescinded, the marking requirements will apply from the date forward that the waiver is rescinded. In the event a waiver is rescinded after the period of performance but before closeout as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, the USAID mission or operating unit with initial responsibility to administer the marking requirements must make a cost benefit analysis as to requiring USAID marking requirements after the end date of the affected programs, projects, activities, public communications or commodities.\n\n(l) USAID will provide the USAID Identity and other guidance at no cost or fee to recipients of USAID grants, cooperative agreements or other assistance awards or subawards. USAID will fund additional costs associated with marking requirements if reasonable, allowable, and allocable under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. Recipients must follow the standard cost reimbursement provisions of the grant, cooperative agreement, other assistance award or subaward when applying for reimbursement of additional marking costs.",

This section implements section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. 13525, and sets forth a general statement of policy, including procedures and interpretations, for the guidance of implementing DOE officials in making mandatory pre-award determinations of eligibility for financial assistance under Titles XX through XXIII of that Act.\n\n(b) Definitions. The definitions in Subpart A of 2 CFR part 200, including the definition of the term “Federal financial assistance,” are applicable to this section. In addition, as used in this section:\n\nAct means the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n\nCompany means any business entity other than an organization of the type described in section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).\n\nCovered program means a program under Titles XX through XXIII of the Act. (A list of covered programs, updated periodically as appropriate, is maintained and published by the Department of Energy.)\n\nParent company means a company that:\n\n(1) Exercises ultimate ownership of the applicant company either directly, by ownership of a majority of that company's voting securities, or indirectly, by control over a majority of that company's voting securities through one or more intermediate subsidiary companies or otherwise, and\n\n(2) Is not itself subject to the ultimate ownership control of another company.\n\nUnited States means the several States, the District of Columbia, and all commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States.\n\nUnited States-owned company means:\n\n(1) A company that has majority ownership by individuals who are citizens of the United States, or\n\n(2) A company organized under the laws of a State that either has no parent company or has a parent company organized under the laws of a State.\n\nVoting security has the meaning given the term in the Public Utility Holding Company Act (15 U.S.C. 15b(17)).\n\n(c) What must DOE determine. A company shall be eligible to receive an award of financial assistance under a covered program only if DOE finds that—\n\n(1) Consistent with § 910.124(d), the company's participation in a covered program would be in the economic interest of the United States; and\n\n(2) The company is either—\n\n(i) A United States-owned company; or\n\n(ii) Incorporated or organized under the laws of any State and has a parent company which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a country which—\n\n(A) Affords to the United States-owned companies opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to those authorized under the Act;\n\n(B) Affords to United States-owned companies local investment opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other company; and\n\n(C) Affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual property rights of United States-owned companies.\n\n(d) Determining the economic interest of the United States. In determining whether participation of an applicant company in a covered program would be in the economic interest of the United States under § 910.124(c)(1), DOE may consider any evidence showing that a financial assistance award would be in the economic interest of the United States including, but not limited to—\n\n(1) Investments by the applicant company and its affiliates in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing (including, for example, the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States);\n\n(2) Significant contributions to employment in the United States by the applicant company and its affiliates; and\n\n(3) An agreement by the applicant company, with respect to any technology arising from the financial assistance being sought—\n\n(i) To promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology (taking into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry); and\n\n(ii) To procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers.\n\n(e) Information an applicant must submit.\n\n(1) Any applicant for Federal financial assistance under a covered program shall submit with the application for Federal financial assistance, or at such later time as may be specified by DOE, evidence for DOE to consider in making findings required under § 910.124 (c)(1) and findings concerning ownership status under § 910.124(c)(2).\n\n(2) If an applicant for Federal financial assistance is submitting evidence relating to future undertakings, such as an agreement under § 910.124(d)(3) to promote manufacture in the United States of products resulting from a technology developed with financial assistance or to procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers, the applicant shall submit a representation affirming acceptance of these undertakings. The applicant should also briefly describe its plans, if any, for any manufacturing of products arising from the program-supported research and development, including the location where such manufacturing is expected to occur.\n\n(3) If an applicant for Federal financial assistance is claiming to be a United States-owned company, the applicant must submit a representation affirming that it falls within the definition of that term provided in § 910.124(b).\n\n(4) DOE may require submission of additional information deemed necessary to make any portion of the determination required by § 910.124(b) 2.\n\n(f) Other information DOE may consider.\n\nIn making the determination under § 910.124(c)(2)(ii), DOE may—\n\n(1) Consider information on the relevant international and domestic law obligations of the country of incorporation of the parent company of an applicant;\n\n(2) Consider information relating to the policies and practices of the country of incorporation of the parent company of an applicant with respect to:\n\n(i) The eligibility criteria for, and the experience of United States-owned company participation in, energy-related research and development programs;\n\n(ii) Local investment opportunities afforded to United States-owned companies; and\n\n(iii) Protection of intellectual property rights of United States-owned companies;\n\n(3) Seek and consider advice from other federal agencies, as appropriate; and\n\n(4) Consider any publicly available information in addition to the information provided by the applicant.",

This authority cannot not be delegated.\n\n(d) Approval requirements. Determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:\n\n(1) Documented in writing;\n\n(2) Concurred in by the responsible program technical official and local legal counsel; and\n\n(3) Approved, prior to award, by the Contracting Officer and an approver at least one level above the CO.\n\n(e) Definitions.

ADR may be used at any stage of a dispute.\n\n(c) Final determination. Whenever a dispute is not resolved informally or through an alternative dispute resolution process, DOE shall mail (by certified mail) a brief written determination signed by a Contracting Officer, setting forth DOE's final disposition of such dispute. Such determination shall contain the following information:\n\n(1) A summary of the dispute, including a statement of the issues and of the positions taken by DOE and the party or parties to the dispute; and\n\n(2) The factual, legal and, if appropriate, policy reasons for DOE's disposition of the dispute.\n\n(d) Right of appeal.

          "content": "§ 910.132   Research misconduct.\n(a) A recipient is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research of any kind under an award from DOE including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this section.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:\n\nAdjudication means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.\n\nFabrication means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.\n\nFalsification means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.\n\nFinding of Research Misconduct means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.\n\nInquiry means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.\n\nInvestigation means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.\n\nPlagiarism means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.\n\nResearch misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.\n\nResearch record means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:\n\n(1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;\n\n(2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).\n\n(3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.\n\n(d) DOE may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:\n\n(1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;\n\n(2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;\n\n(3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,\n\n(4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.\n\n(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.\n\n(f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and DOE, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n(1) Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations. The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: Protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.\n\n(2) Objectivity and expertise. The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.\n\n(3) Timeliness. The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.\n\n(4) Confidentiality. To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.\n\n(5) Remediation and sanction. If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.\n\n(g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.\n\n(h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.",

Recipients may purchase real property or equipment with an acquisition cost per unit of $5,000 or more in whole or in part with Federal funds only with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or in accordance with express award terms.\n\n(b) Title. Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient, subject to all terms and conditions of the award and that the recipient shall:\n\n(1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, as may be determined by the contracting officer;\n\n(2) Not encumber or permit any encumbrance on the real property or equipment without the prior written approval of the contracting officer;\n\n(3) Use and dispose of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section; and\n\n(4) Properly record, and consent to the Department's ability to properly record if the recipient fails to do so, UCC financing statement(s) for all equipment purchased with Federal funds (Financial assistance awards made under the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program are exempt from this requirement unless otherwise specified within the grant agreement); such a filing is required when the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $1,000,000, and the Contracting Officer may require it in his or her discretion when the Federal share is less than $1,000,000. These financing statement(s) must be approved in writing by the contracting officer prior to the recording, and they shall provide notice that the recipient's title to all equipment (not real property) purchased with Federal funds under the financial assistance agreement is conditional pursuant to the terms of this section, and that the Government retains an undivided reversionary interest in the equipment. The UCC financing statement(s) must be filed before the contracting officer may reimburse the recipient for the Federal share of the equipment unless otherwise provided for in the relevant financial assistance agreement. The recipient shall further make any amendments to the financing statements or additional recordings, including appropriate continuation statements, as necessary or as the contracting officer may direct.\n\n(c) Remedies. If the recipient fails at any time to comply with any of the conditions or requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, then the contracting officer may:\n\n(1) Notify the recipient of noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339, which may lead to suspension or termination of the award;\n\n(2) Impose special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206 and 200.208 as amended by 910.372;\n\n(3) Issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;\n\n(4) In the case of a failure to properly record UCC financing statement(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, effect such a recording; and\n\n(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.\n\n(d) Title to and Federal interest in real property or equipment offered as cost-share. As provided in 2 CFR 200.306(h), depending upon the purpose of the Federal award, a recipient may offer the fair market value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the recipient holds conditional title to the property and the Government has an undivided reversionary interest in the share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project. The property is treated as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and to the provisions of 2 CFR 200.311 and 200.313.\n\n(e) Insurance. Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.\n\n(f) Additional uses during and after the project period. Unless a statute and the award terms expressly provide for the vesting of unconditional title to real property or equipment with the recipient, the real property or equipment acquired wholly or in part with Federal funds is subject to the following:\n\n(1) During the Project Period, the recipient must make real property and equipment available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:\n\n(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;\n\n(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;\n\n(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.\n\n(2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or if, as may be determined by the contracting officer, the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, or if the recipient suspends work on the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, if:\n\n(i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used;\n\n(ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded Federal award; and\n\n(iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.\n\n(iv) If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the recipient must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(g) Disposition. (1) If, as determined by the contracting officer, an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, or if the recipient has suspended work on the project, the recipient has the following options:\n\n(i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.\n\n(ii) If the property is equipment (rather than real property) and with the written approval of the contracting officer, the recipient may replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment.\n\n(iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.\n\n(iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.\n\n(2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:\n\n(i) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:\n\n(A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to a third party designated by the contracting officer provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred; or\n\n(B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.\n\n(3) If the contracting officer fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.\n\n[80 FR 53237, Sept. 3, 2015, as amended at 87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]",

This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement made to a For-Profit entity by DOE.\n\n(b) Patents right—small business concerns. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.\n\n(c) Patent rights—other than small business concerns, e.g., large businesses—\n\n(1) No Patent Waiver. Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)—No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.\n\n(2) Patent Waiver Granted. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:\n\n(i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;\n\n(ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or\n\n(iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.\n\n(3) Special Provision. Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government, e.g., clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.\n\n(d) Rights in data—general rule. (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data—General”.\n\n(2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.\n\n(3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist, e.g., DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.\n\n(e) Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes. (1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.\n\n(2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.\n\n(f) Rights in data—SBIR/STTR programs. If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data—SBIR Program”.\n\n(g) Authorization and consent. (1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.\n\n(2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.\n\n(3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.",

Any recipient of any award for research, development and/or demonstration must comply with all applicable U.S. laws regarding export control.\n\n(b) U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness. It is the policy of DOE to ensure that DOE-funded research, development, and/or demonstration projects foster domestic manufacturing. Funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), therefore, may require that applicants submit a “U.S. Manufacturing Plan” in their applications. Such FOAs may encourage U.S. Manufacturing Plans to include proposals by recipients and any sub-recipients to manufacture DOE-funded technologies in the United States; however, the FOAs will also state that these plans should not include requirements regarding the source of inputs used during the manufacturing process. Regardless of whether such plans will be part of the merit review criteria or a program policy factor, and to the extent legally permissible, all awards subject to this subpart, including subawards, for research, development, and/or demonstration, must include a provision that provides plans by the recipient and any subrecipients to support manufacturing in the United States of technology developed under the award. The recipient and any subrecipients must agree to make those plans binding on any assignee or licensee or any entity otherwise acquiring rights to any subject invention or developed technology covered under the award. A recipient, subrecipient, assignee, licensee, or any entity otherwise acquiring the rights to any subject invention or developed technology may request a waiver or modification of U.S. manufacturing plans from DOE. DOE will determine whether to approve such a waiver in light of equitable considerations, including, for example, whether the requester satisfactorily shows that the planned support is not economically feasible and whether there is a satisfactory alternative net benefit to the U.S. economy if the requested waiver or modification is approved.\n\n[80 FR 53239, Sept. 3, 2015]",

Such notification must include, at a minimum, copies of documents necessary to reflect the transaction that resulted or will result in the change of control, and identification of all entities, individuals or other parties to such transaction. Failure to notify the contracting officer of a change of control is grounds for suspension or termination of the award for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.\n\n(d) The contracting officer must authorize a change of control for the purposes of the award. Failure to receive the contracting officer's authorization for a change of control may lead to a suspension of the award, termination for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or imposition of special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 910.372.

A for-profit entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in DOE awards must have a compliance audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\n\n(b) Compliance audit. (1) If a for-profit entity has one or more DOE awards with expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, they must have a compliance audit for each of the awards with $750,000 or more in expenditures. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit.\n\n(2) If a for-profit entity receives more than one award from DOE with a sum total of expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, but does not have any single award with expenditures of $750,000 or more; the entity must determine whether any or all of the awards have common compliance requirements (i.e., are considered a cluster of awards) and determine the total expenditures of the awards with common compliance requirements. A compliance audit is required for the largest cluster of awards (if multiple clusters of awards exist) or the largest award not in a cluster of awards, whichever corresponding expenditure total is greater. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit;\n\n(3) If a for-profit entity receives one or more awards from DOE with a sum total of expenditures less than $750,000, no compliance audit is required;\n\n(4) If the for-profit entity is a sub-recipient, 2 CFR 200.501(h) requires that the pass-through entity establish appropriate monitoring and controls to ensure the sub-recipient complies with award requirements. These compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.514 Scope of audit\n\n(c) Program-specific audit election. Not applicable.\n\n(d) Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000. A for-profit entity that expends less than $750,000 during the for-profit's fiscal year in DOE awards is exempt from DOE audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\n(e) Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.\n\n(f) Subrecipients and Contractors. An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. The provisions of 2 CFR 200.331, Subrecipient and contractor determinations should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.\n\n(g) Compliance responsibility for contractors. In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.\n\n(h) For-profit subrecipient. Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients to DOE Federal award requirements. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for- profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the DOE award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards, such as: Expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the for-profit entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.\n\n(b) Loan and loan guarantees (loans).

Free rent received by itself is not considered a DOE award expended under this Part. However, free rent received as part of a DOE award to carry out a DOE program must be included in determining DOE awards expended and subject to audit under this part.\n\n(g) Valuing non-cash assistance. DOE non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by DOE.\n\n(h) Not applicable.\n\n(i) Not applicable.\n\n(j) Not applicable.\n\n[87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]",

The auditee must prepare a schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for the period covered by the auditee's fiscal year which must include the total DOE awards expended as determined in accordance with § 910.502 Basis for determining DOE awards expended. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by DOE and pass- through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a DOE program has multiple DOE award years, the auditee may list the amount of DOE awards expended for each DOE award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:\n\n(1) List individual DOE programs. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual DOE programs within the cluster of programs. For R&D, total DOE awards expended must be shown by individual DOE award and major subdivision within DOE. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n(2) Not applicable.\n\n(3) Provide total DOE awards expended for each individual DOE program and the CFDA number For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.\n\n(4) Not applicable.\n\n(5) Not applicable.\n\n(6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the for-profit entity elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in 2 CFR 200.414 Indirect (F&A) costs.",

As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.\n\n(b) Summary schedule of prior audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.\n\n(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.\n\n(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in DOE's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.\n\n(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:\n\n(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to DOE;\n\n(ii) DOE is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and\n\n(iii) A management decision was not issued.\n\n(c) Corrective action plan. At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 910.516 Audit findings, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.",

The financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards must be for the same audit period.\n\n(b) Financial statements. If financial statements are available, the auditor must determine whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.\n\n(c) Internal control. (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over DOE programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.\n\n(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:\n\n(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements; and\n\n(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.\n\n(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.\n\n(d) Compliance. (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect.\n\n(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.\n\n(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.\n\n(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.\n\n(e) Audit follow-up. The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up paragraph (b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.\n\n(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.\n\n(3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program.

Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this Part to perform audit procedures for such a DOE program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a DOE program that is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.\n\n(5) Not applicable.\n\n(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a DOE award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for DOE awards.

Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for DOE to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:\n\n(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, and Federal award identification number and year. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or DOE award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.\n\n(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the DOE awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.\n\n(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.\n\n(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.\n\n(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and DOE to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.\n\n(6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable CFDA number(s) and applicable DOE award identification number(s).\n\n(7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.\n\n(8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.\n\n(9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.\n\n(10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.\n\n(c) Reference numbers.

The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the DOE program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular DOE program with auditee management and DOE.\n\n(b) Current and prior audit experience. (1) Weaknesses in internal control over DOE programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over DOE programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the DOE programs.\n\n(i) A DOE program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. The auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.\n\n(ii) When significant parts of a DOE program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.\n\n(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a DOE program or have not been corrected.\n\n(3) DOE programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.\n\n(c) Oversight exercised by DOE. (1) Oversight exercised by DOE could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.\n\n(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.\n\n(d) Inherent risk of the Federal program. (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation—personal services, but otherwise be at low risk.\n\n(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.\n\n(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.\n\n(4) Programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.\n\n[87 FR 15323, Mar. 18, 2022]",

The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, DOE agency may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements (if they were available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.\n\n(b) As provided in § 910.513 Responsibilities, paragraph (c)(3), DOE is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to DOE awards it makes to for-profit entities.\n\n(c) Not applicable.\n\n(d) Time requirements. DOE must issue a management decision within six months of acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.\n\n(e) Reference numbers. Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings paragraph (c).",

A TIA requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management aspects of the project. The goal for using a TIA is to broaden the technology base available to meet DOE mission requirements and foster within the technology base new relationships and practices to advance the national economic and energy security of the United States, to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission, and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex. A TIA therefore is designed to reduce barriers to participation in RD&D programs by for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace. A TIA allows Agreements Officers (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, to tailor Government requirements and lower or remove barriers if it can be done with proper stewardship of Federal funds. A TIA may also promote new relationships among performers in the technology base. Collaborations among for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace, firms that regularly perform on the DOE RD&D programs and nonprofit organizations can enhance overall quality and productivity.",

Some portions of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) may use a term in relation to compliance with a national policy requirement in a statute, Executive order, or other source that defines the term differently than it is defined in subpart B of this part. For purposes of that particular national policy requirement, the definition of a term provided by the source of the requirement and any regulation specifically implementing it takes precedence over the definition in subpart B of this part. Using the definition of a term that takes precedence for each national policy requirement is therefore important when determining the applicability and effect of that requirement.\n\n(b) Examples. (1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:\n\n(i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);\n\n(ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;\n\n(iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and\n\n(iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.\n\n(2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term “State” is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.",

For an administrative modification, the award cover pages should include a brief description of the purpose of the modification (e.g., a no-cost extension of the end date of the period of performance).\n\n(5) For a new award or funding modification:\n\n(i) A brief description of the project or program supported by the award.\n\n(ii) The amount of the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds due to the current action and any accompanying change in the total amount of cost sharing or matching required under the award.\n\n(iii) The cumulative amounts of Federal funds and any corresponding non-Federal share obligated to date (i.e., the sums of the amounts of the current action and the cumulative amounts of prior obligations and deobligations).\n\n(iv) The total amount of the project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, the Federal share of that amount, and the non-Federal share even if that share is “zero.”\n\n(v) The total value of the award; the Federal share of that total value (which includes Federal funding obligated to date; future incremental funding actions; and options for which amounts have been predetermined, whether or not they have been exercised yet); and the non-Federal share of that total value (i.e., total cost sharing or matching required under the award).\n\n(vi) A table such as the following may be helpful in clearly presenting the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (vi) of this section:\n\n \nFederal\nfunds\nCorresponding\nnon-Federal\nshare\nTotal\namount\n(A) Obligated or deobligated this action(B) Cumulative obligations to date, including this and previous actions(C) Planned project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, to include any future incremental funding obligations(D) Total value, which includes any unexercised options for which amounts were established in the award\n(6) The obligation date (i.e., the date of the grants officer's signature) and, if different, the effective date.\n\n(7) The start date and current end date of the period of performance.\n\n(8) The statutory authority or authorities under which the award or modification was made.\n\n(9) The number and title of the program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under which the award or modification was made.\n\n(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):\n\n(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or “cluster”) of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).\n\n(ii) What the award includes in addition to the cover pages—i.e., the:\n\n(A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;\n\n(B) Approved budget; and\n\n(C) General, and any award specific, terms and conditions of the award.\n\n(iii) Where the portions of the award listed in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section are located, which content the DoD Component generally should incorporate into the award by reference. When incorporating that content into the award by reference, the DoD Component must both:\n\n(A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and\n\n(B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.\n\n(iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements (e.g., Federal statutes).\n\n(v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award. If there are multiple individuals and offices for different post-award functions (e.g., payments and property administration), the award cover pages should provide information about each.\n\n(vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.\n\n(b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:\n\n(1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.\n\n(2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or “doing business as” name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.\n\n(3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.\n\n(4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.\n\n(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply—i.e., the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate—if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.\n\n(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:\n\n(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.\n\n(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.",

This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions.

This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with § 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.\n\n(f) Definitions.

Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:\n\n(1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under “major programs,” as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.\n\n(2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States—i.e., awards that are not under major programs.\n\n(b) Award terms and conditions—(1) General. Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.\n\n(2) Exception for awards under major programs. If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:\n\n(i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and\n\n(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.",

OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements—advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.\n\n(1) Advance payments. With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:\n\n(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and\n\n(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).\n\n(2) Reimbursement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.\n\n(b) Award terms and conditions—(1) General. Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:\n\n(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and\n\n(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.\n\n(2) Alternative award terms and conditions. A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:\n\n(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;\n\n(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;\n\n(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and\n\n(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.",

Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.\n\n(2) Other payment procedures or instructions.

          "content": "§ 1128.415   Prior approvals for non-construction activities.\n(a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.\n\n(b) DoD implementation of the guidance. The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (i.e., prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.\n\n(c) Scope or objective, cost sharing or matching, and additional Federal funds. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:\n\n(1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).\n\n(2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).\n\n(3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).\n\n(d) Personnel changes, disengagements, or reductions in time. A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:\n\n(1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).\n\n(2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).\n\n(e) Costs requiring prior approval under the cost principles. With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):\n\n(1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.\n\n(2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:\n\n(i) Which, if any, to waive; and\n\n(ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions (e.g., a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).\n\n(f) Transfers of funds and subawards. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:\n\n(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).\n\n(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).\n\n(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.\n\n(g) Pre-award costs, carry forward of unobligated balances, and no-cost extensions. (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.\n\n(2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.\n\n(3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies (e.g., the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.\n\n(h) Award terms and conditions. Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:\n\n(1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.\n\n(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.\n\n(3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).\n\n(4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section (e.g., to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).\n\n(5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.",

          "content": "§ 1128.630   Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.\n(a) OMB guidance. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:\n\n(1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and\n\n(2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.\n\n(b) DoD implementation. DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:\n\n(1) Cost principles to be used for valuation. (i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.\n\n(ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property (i.e., counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.\n\n(2) Donations of property to projects or programs under awards. (i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:\n\n(A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and\n\n(B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).\n\n(ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.\n\n(iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions—(1) General. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.\n\n(2) Exception. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the wording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, or other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.",

OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.\n\n(b) DoD implementation. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.\n\n(1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:\n\n(i) Addition. A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.\n\n(ii) Deduction. A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.\n\n(iii) Cost sharing or matching. Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.\n\n(iv) Combination. The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.\n\n(2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.\n\n(3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions. (1) Default—addition alternative. In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:\n\n(i) Research awards; and\n\n(ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.\n\n(2) Deduction alternative. A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:\n\n(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: “1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”\n\n(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: “If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts.”\n\n(3) Cost-sharing or matching alternative. A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: “You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”\n\n(4) A combination of alternatives. A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.",

Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other than by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in PROP Articles II-IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.\n\n(b) Exceptions to the general policy when there is statutory authority—(1) Exempt property in general. If a DoD Component has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either unconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II-IV and VI. This subpart refers to acquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority—and elects to use it—as “exempt property.”\n\n(2) Research awards. (i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property (i.e., equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research—without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate—if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.\n\n(ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:\n\n(A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.\n\n(B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.\n\n(C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions—(1) General.

This broadened applicability is in accordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in Executive Order 12591, “Facilitating Access to Science and Technology.”\n\n(2) Establishes a requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their awards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.\n\n(3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by recipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions.

The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent than annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (e.g., when more frequent reporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).\n\n(2) Due dates. The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:\n\n(i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; and\n\n(ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the agency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.\n\n(b) DoD implementation. DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and due dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and added specifications concerning reporting periods:\n\n(1) Reporting frequency. DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.\n\n(2) Reporting periods. For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim performance reports on a cumulative basis—i.e., the second and any subsequent performance report should address only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier interim performance reports.\n\n(3) Due dates. If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual circumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component must specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim reports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions. A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:\n\n(1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;\n\n(2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and\n\n(3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the reporting period.",

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:\n\n(A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.\n\n(B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.\n\n(ii) Exception. A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.\n\n(2) Reporting periods—(i) Non-construction awards other than research. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.\n\n(ii) Research. Final reports for research awards must be cumulative (i.e., each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).\n\n(c) Award terms and conditions.

          "content": "§ 1134.210   Content of REP Article II.\n(a) Requirement. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify what financial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.\n\n(b) Award terms and conditions—(1) General. Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial reporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days after the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.\n\n(2) Required reporting form, format, or data elements for interim and final financial reports. In Section A of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-approved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the website where they can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports during the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed on the final report.\n\n(3) Interim financial reports: Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates. In Section B of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which recipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it is due. However, this section of the article may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information already provided with payment requests (e.g., on the SF-270).\n\n(i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (e.g., a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).\n\n(ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.\n\n(iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules—which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards—the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.\n\n(4) Final financial report. Appendix B to this part provides wording for Section C of REP Article II to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 provides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to recipients, the wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-award administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any information they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the wording or supplement it if the DoD Component has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n(5) Extensions of due dates. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording for Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim or final financial reports.\n\n(6) Where and how to submit financial reports. In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must submit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so (e.g., email or other electronic submission method).",

Competition is expected in awarding discretionary funds, unless otherwise directed by Congress. When grants and cooperative agreements are awarded competitively, DOI requires that the competitive process be fair and impartial, that all applicants be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the announcement, and that no applicant receive an unfair competitive advantage. All competitive funding announcements, and all modifications/amendments to those announcements, must be posted on Grants.gov (www.grants.gov).\n\n(b) Independent objective evaluation of financial assistance applications and proposals.

Bureaus and offices must ensure reviewers are qualified, applications are scored on the basis of announced criteria, consideration is given to the level of applicant risk and past performance, applications are ranked, and funding determinations are made.\n\n(c) Evaluation and Selection Plan for notice of funding opportunities. Bureaus and offices must develop an Evaluation and Selection Plan in concert with the notice of funding opportunity to ensure consistency, and to outline and document the selection process. The Evaluation and Selection Plan should be finalized prior to the release of the notice of funding opportunity. An Evaluation and Selection Plan is comprised of five basic elements:\n\n(1) Merit review factors and sub-factors;\n\n(2) A rating system (e.g., adjectival, color coding, numerical, or ordinal);\n\n(3) Evaluation standards or descriptions that explain the basis for assignment of the various rating system grades/scores;\n\n(4) Program policy factors; and\n\n(5) The basis for selection.\n\n(d) Basic review standards. Bureaus and offices must initially screen applications/proposals to ensure that they meet the standards in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section before they are subjected to a detailed evaluation utilizing a merit review process specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The review system should include three phases: Initial Screening, Threshold Screening, and a Merit Review Evaluation Screening. Bureaus and offices may remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass the basic eligibility screening per paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.\n\n(e) Completeness. Bureaus and offices may return applications/proposals that are incomplete or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the Grants.gov announcement to the applicant to be corrected, modified, or supplemented, or may reject the application/proposal outright. Until the application/proposal meets the substantive requirements of the announcement and this part, it shall not be given detailed evaluation. Bureaus and offices may use discretion to determine the length of time for applicants to resolve application deficiencies.\n\n(f) Timeliness. Bureaus and offices must consider the timeliness of the application submission. Applications that are submitted beyond the announced deadline date must be removed from the review process.\n\n(g) Threshold Screening. Bureaus and offices are responsible for screening applications and proposals for the adequacy of the budget and compliance with statutory and other requirements. The SF-424 and budget information (SF-424A, SF-424C, or OMB-approved alternate budget data collection) must be reviewed according to Department of the Interior policy.\n\n(h) Merit Review Evaluation Screening. This is the final review stage where the technical merit of the application/proposal is reviewed. In the absence of a program rule or statutory requirement, program officials shall develop criteria that include all aspects of technical merit. Bureaus and offices shall develop criteria that are conceptually independent of each other, but all-encompassing when taken together. While criteria will vary, the basic criteria shall focus reviewers' attention on the project's underlying merit (i.e., significance, approach, and feasibility). The criteria shall focus not only on the technical details of the proposed project but also on the broader importance or potential impact of the project. The criteria shall be easily understood.\n\n(i) Risk assessments. Bureaus and offices must also consider risk thresholds during application/proposal review process. Elements to be considered may include organization; single audit submissions, past performance; availability of necessary resources, equipment, or facilities; financial strength and management capabilities; and procurement procedures; or procedures for selecting and monitoring subrecipients or sub-vendors, if applicable. For all non-Federal entities that receive an award, the Financial Assistance Officer must document the risk analysis.\n\n(j) Requirements for proposal evaluators. Upon receipt of a Memorandum of Appointment, each proposal evaluator and advisor must sign and return a Conflict of Interest Certificate to the Financial Assistance Officer. If an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the appointee may not evaluate or provide advice on a potential applicant's proposal until the conflict has been resolved or mitigated. Further, each proposal evaluator or advisor must agree to comply with any notice or limitation placed on the application. Upon completion of the review, the proposal evaluator or advisor shall return or destroy all copies of the application and accompanying proposals (or abstracts) to DOI; and unless authorized by the Financial Assistance Officer or agency designee, the reviewer shall not contact the non-Federal entity concerning any aspect of the application.",

Bureaus and offices must ensure compliance with the prior written approval requirements for land acquisition in 2 CFR 200.439. Whenever a recipient is seeking DOI's approval to use award funds to purchase an interest in real property, the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, SF-429-B, Request to Acquire, Improve, or Furnish, or approved alternate standardized data collection, must be submitted to the bureau or office. The Financial Assistance Officer is responsible for ensuring that this requirement is met. All aspects of the purchase must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to purchases of land or interests in land.\n\n(b) Appraisal requirements for land purchases. (1) Unless a waiver valuation applies in accordance with 49 CFR 24.102(c), land or interests in land that will be acquired under the award must be appraised in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, (UASFLA or the “Yellow Book”), developed and promulgated by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, 1155 15th Street NW, Suite 1111, Washington, DC 20005, by a real property appraiser licensed or certified by the State or States in which the property is located. The appraisal report shall be reviewed by a qualified review appraiser that meets qualifications established by the DOI Appraisal and Valuation Services Office (AVSO), which is responsible for appraisal and valuation services and policy across the Department. Bureaus and offices shall ensure that funds are not disbursed for purchases of land or interests in land without an appraisal accompanied by a written appraisal review report that complies with standards approved by AVSO. Where appraisals are required to support federally assisted land acquisitions, AVSO has oversight responsibilities for these appraisals, including those purchased through financial assistance actions in the various grant programs within the Department. AVSO will coordinate with grant programs to conduct periodic internal control review of appraisal and appraisal review reports prepared in conjunction with grant applications for land acquisition.\n\n(2) The Director of the Federal Register approves the material referenced in this section for incorporation by reference into this section in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Land to be acquired under an award that is located outside the United States must be appraised by an independent real property appraiser licensed or certified in the country in which the property is located in accordance with any in-country appraisal standards, if they exist, or with International Valuation Standards, when such appraisals are available and financially feasible. Otherwise, the non-Federal entity must use the most widely accepted business practice for property valuation in the country where the property is located and provide to the awarding DOI bureau or office a detailed explanation of the methodology used to determine value.\n\n(d) Requirements for recipient reporting on real property purchases. (1) For all financial assistance actions where real property is acquired under the Federal award, the recipient must submit reports on the status of the real property. Bureaus and offices must ensure recipients receive written notification of those reporting requirements, including reporting frequency/schedule, report content requirements, and submission instructions, at the time of award.\n\n(2) If the interest in the land will be held for less than 15 years, reports must be submitted annually. If the interest in the land will be held for 15 years or more, then the recipient must submit the first report within one year of the period of performance end date of the award and then, at a minimum, every five years thereafter.\n\n(3) The reports must be submitted to the Financial Assistance Officer within the period of performance of the award. After the end of the period of performance, reports must be submitted to a designated individual. Each bureau must have a process in place to designate specific individuals to receive, and review and accept the report.\n\n(4) Recipients must use the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, the Real Property Status Report Standard Form (SF) 429-A, General Reporting, to report status of land or interests in land under Federal financial assistance awards. Bureaus or offices may request to use an equivalent reporting format. The Director, Office of Grants Management must approve alternate equivalent formats.\n\n(5) Reports must include, at a minimum, sufficient information to demonstrate that all conditions imposed on the land use are being met, and a signed certification to that fact by the recipient of the financial assistance award.\n\n(6) The Financial Assistance Officer must indicate the reporting schedule, including due dates, in the award document. The schedule must conform with the frequency required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For awards issued prior to October 29, 2019, the recipient must contact the program to establish due dates for reports going forward. If there is already a reporting schedule in place, then the recipient and the program shall ensure that the schedule is updated to conform with this part prior to the due date of the next scheduled report.",

          "content": "§ 1402.414   What are the negotiated indirect cost rate deviation policies?\n(a) This section establishes DOI policies, procedures, and decision making criteria for using an indirect cost rate that differs from the non-Federal entity's negotiated rate or approved rate for DOI awards. These are established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(3) or (f).\n\n(b) DOI accepts indirect cost rates that have been reduced or removed voluntarily by the proposed recipient of the award, on an award-specific basis.\n\n(c) For all deviations to the Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, including statutory, regulatory, programmatic, and voluntary, the basis of direct costs against which the indirect cost rate is applied must be:\n\n(1) The same base identified in the recipient's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, if the recipient has a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement; or\n\n(2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).\n\n(d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.\n\n(1) Indirect cost rate deviation required by statute or regulation. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.\n\n(2) Indirect cost rate reductions used as cost-share. Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.\n\n(3) Programmatic indirect cost rate deviation approval process. Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:\n\n(i) Program qualifications. Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.\n\n(ii) Deviation requests. Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.\n\n(iii) Approvals. Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.\n\n(4) Voluntary indirect cost rate reduction. On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.\n\n(5) Unrecovered indirect costs. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.",

In contrast, suspensions and debarments imposed under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, are exclusions imposed at the discretion of Federal suspending or debarring officials.

It is the EPA's policy to carry out CAA and CWA disqualifications in a manner which integrates the disqualifications into the Governmentwide suspension and debarment system. Whenever the EPA determines that the risk presented to Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities on the basis of the misconduct which gives rise to a person's CAA or CWA conviction exceeds the coverage afforded by mandatory disqualification, the EPA may use its discretionary authority to suspend or debar a person under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.",

Your request must include documentation sufficient to support all material assertions you make. The debarring official must determine that all the technical and non-technical causes, conditions and consequences of your actions have been sufficiently addressed so that the Government can confidently conduct future business activities with you, and that your future operations will be conducted in compliance with the CAA and CWA.\n\n(b) You may begin the reinstatement process by having informal discussions with the EPA representative named in your notification of listing. Having informal dialogue with that person will make you aware of the EPA concerns that must be addressed. The EPA representative is not required to negotiate conditions for your reinstatement. However, beginning the reinstatement process with informal dialogue increases the chance of achieving a favorable outcome, and avoids unnecessary delay that may result from an incomplete or inadequate reinstatement request.

The official or designee who imposed the sanction shall preside. At the conference, you may appear with a representative and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, or within 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials, the official or designee shall, in writing, advise you of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation. If all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is affirmed, the notice of affirmation shall advise you of the opportunity to contest the notice and to request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. You have 30 days after receipt of the notice of affirmation to request this hearing. If the official or designee does not issue a decision within the 20-day period, you may contest the sanction before a Departmental Hearing Officer. Again, you have 30 days from the expiration of the 20-day period to request this hearing. If you request a hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500.\n\n(b) You may skip the conference with the official and you may request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. This must also be done within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation. If you opt to have a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500. The hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer is more formal than the conference before the sanctioning official described above. The Departmental Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing in accordance with 24 CFR part 26, subpart A. The Departmental Hearing Officer will issue findings of fact and make a recommended decision. The sanctioning official will then make a final decision, as promptly as possible, after the Departmental Hearing Officer's recommended decision is issued. The sanctioning official may reject the recommended decision or any findings of fact, only after specifically determining that the decision or any of the facts are arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.\n\n(c) In deciding whether to terminate, modify, or affirm a limited denial of participation, the Departmental official or designee may consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860. The Departmental Hearing Officer may also consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860 in making any recommended decision.",

Such a determination must be made within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the suspension or proposed debarment, unless the suspending/debarring official extends the period for good cause.\n\n(i) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, the entire consolidated matter will be referred to the hearing officer hearing the limited denial of participation, for additional proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR 180.750 or 180.845.\n\n(ii) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is no dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, jurisdiction of the hearing officer under 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J, to hear those parts of the limited denial of participation based on the same transaction[s] or conduct as the debarment or suspension, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, will be transferred to the debarring or suspending official, and the hearing officer responsible for hearing the limited denial of participation shall transfer the administrative record to the debarring or suspending official.\n\n(3) The suspending or debarring official shall hear the entire consolidated case under the procedures governing suspensions and debarments, and shall issue a final decision as to both the limited denial of participation and the suspension or debarment.",

In order to establish its eligibility, such an institution must provide information regarding the following:\n\n(i) The number of staff members devoted to museum functions as described in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(ii) The period of time that such museum functions have been carried out by the institution over the course of the institution's history.\n\n(iii) Appropriate financial information for such functions presented separately from the financial information of the institution as a whole.\n\n(iv) The percentage of the institution's total space devoted to such museum functions.\n\n(v) Such other information as the Director requests.\n\n(3) The Director uses the information furnished under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in making a determination regarding the eligibility of such an institution under this section.\n\n(e) For the purpose of this section, an institution exhibits objects to the public if it exhibits the objects through facilities which it owns or operates.\n\n[79 FR 76088, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 84 FR 27704, June 14, 2019]",

For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to Part 3485—Covered Transactions.\n\n(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.\n\n(4) The contract is to perform services as a third party servicer in connection with a title IV, HEA program.\n\n(c) In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by ED under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

          "content": "§ 5800.890   How may I appeal my debarment?\n(a) If the Commission debarring official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.870 to debar you after you present information in opposition to a proposed debarment under § 180.815, you may ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:\n\n(1) You may ask the debarring official under § 875 to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or\n\n(2) You may request a review by the EAC's debarment appeals body (DAP), which is composed of the Executive Director, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. The DAP will review your appeal and make a determination on whether to sustain or reverse the decision of the debarring official. The DAP will then make a recommendation to the EAC Commissioners who will vote by circulation on whether to accept or reject the recommendation of the DAP. A request to review the debarring official's decision to debar you must be made within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the DAP may recommend to the EAC Commissioners that the debarring official's decision be reversed, based on a majority vote of the DAP, only where the DAP finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where DAP finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration.\n\n(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “Debarment Appeal;” state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position. The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 300, Washington, DC 20005.\n\n(c) After the circulation vote of the EAC Commissioners has been certified, either the Commission debarring official or the DAP must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.\n\n(d) [Reserved]\n\n(e) Nothing in this part prohibits the EAC from delegating the appeal review process to another Federal agency through a memorandum of understanding or interagency agreement.",
