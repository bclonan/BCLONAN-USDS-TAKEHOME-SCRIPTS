Pursuant to § 3b.3(a)(4) of this part, the Commission will identify in the Federal Register the specific provisions in law which authorize it to maintain information in a system of records. In determining the relevance and necessity of records, the following considerations will govern: \n\n(1) Whether each item of information relates to the purposes, in law, for which the system is maintained; \n\n(2) The adverse consequences, if any, of not collecting the information; \n\n(3) Whether the need for the information could be met through the maintenance of the information in a non-individually identifiable form; \n\n(4) Whether the information in the record is required to be collected on every individual who is the subject of a record in the system or whether a sampling procedure would suffice; \n\n(5) The length of time it is necessary to retain the information; \n\n(6) The financial cost of maintaining the record as compared to the adverse consequences of not maintaining it; and \n\n(7) Whether the information, while generally relevant and necessary to accomplish a statutory purpose, is specifically relevant and necessary only in certain cases. \n\n(b) All records which the Commission maintains in a system of records and which are used to make a determination about an individual will be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Where practicable, in questionable instances, reverification of pertinent information with the individual to whom the record pertains may be appropriate. In pursuit of completeness in the collection of information, the Commission will limit its records to those elements of information which clearly bear on the determination for which the records are intended to be used, assuring that all elements necessary to the determination are present before the determination is made. \n\n(c) Prior to disseminating any records in a system of records, the Commission will make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are as accurate, relevant, timely, and complete as appropriate for the purposes for which they are collected and/or maintained, except when they are disclosed to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or to another agency. \n\n(d) No records of the Commission in a system of records shall describe how any individual exercises his First Amendment rights unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. The exercise of these rights includes, but is not limited to, religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom of assembly and petition. In determining whether or not a particular activity constitutes the exercise of a right guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Commission will apply the broadest reasonable interpretation.",

When an individual is requested to disclose his social security number to the Commission, he will be informed under what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, what uses will be made of it, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and if it is mandatory, under what provisions of law or regulation. \n\n(d) The use of third-party sources to collect information about an individual may be appropriate in certain circumstances. In determining when the use of third-party sources would be appropriate, the following considerations will govern: \n\n(1) When the information needed can only be obtained from a third party; \n\n(2) When the cost of collecting the information directly from the individual concerned far exceeds the cost of collecting it from a third party; \n\n(3) When there is little risk that the information proposed to be collected from the third party, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination about the individual concerned. \n\n(4) When there is a need to insure the accuracy of information supplied by an individual by verifying it with a third party, or there is a need to obtain a qualitative assessment of the individual's capabilities or character; or \n\n(5) When there are provisions for verifying any third-party information with the individual concerned before making a determination based on that information. \n\nThird party sources, where feasible, will be informed of the purposes for which information which they are asked to provide will be used. In appropriate circumstances, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (2), (5), and (7), the Commission may assure a third party that his identity will not be revealed to the subject of the collected information.",

When the system manager and a doctor determine that the disclosure of such information could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, the system manager may transmit such information to a medical doctor named by the requesting individual.\n(d) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request for access within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

Such requests should contain identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and information in support of the request for amendment. The individual may obtain assistance in preparing his request to amend a record from the appropriate system manager. \n\n(b) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make a determination which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and verification of identity consistent with § 3b.222. The acknowledgement will clearly describe the request and advise the individual requesting the amendment when he may expect to be notified of action taken on the request. No acknowledgement is required if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of compliance or denial within the ten-day period. \n\n(c) The system manager will complete the review and advise the individual in writing of the results within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to complete the review within twenty days of the receipt of the request, he will inform the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown) and when it is anticipated that the review will be completed. If the completion date for the review indicated in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when the review may be expected to be completed. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The system manager will take one of the following actions: \n\n(1) Make the requested correction or amendment; so advise the individual in writing; and, where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226, advise all previous recipients of the record in writing of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment [see § 3b.225(d)]; or \n\n(2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request; the reasons for the refusal including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section; and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review. \n\n(d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the system manager and the Chairman, or the officer he designates pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record. They shall consider the record in terms of the criteria established in § 3b.201 of this part. \n\n(e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review, will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in a writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations: \n\n(1) Make the correction in accordance with the individual's request and proceed as in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or \n\n(2) Inform the individual in writing of: \n\n(i) The refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request, \n\n(ii) The reasons therefor, including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review; \n\n(iii) The right of the individual to file with the Chairman, or designated officer, a concise written statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the decision; \n\n(iv) The fact that the statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, with, at the discretion of the Chairman, or designated officer, a brief statement by the Chairman, or designated officer, summarizing the reasons for refusing to amend the record; \n\n(v) Where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226 of this part, the fact that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement, with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, at the Chairman's or designated officer's discretion, the statement summarizing the refusal to amend [see § 3b.225(d)]; and \n\n(vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the refusal to amend. \n\n(f) The Chairman may designate, in writing, another officer of the Commission to act in his capacity for the purposes of this part.

No blanks should be left in the application. No material or information required in the application should be omitted. If an applicant believes that its application conforms adequately without containing certain required material or information, it must explain in detail why the material or information is not being submitted and what steps were taken by the applicant to provide the material or information. If the Commission finds that an application does not adequately conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, the Commission or its designee will consider the application either deficient or patently deficient.\n\n(1) Deficient applications. (i) An application that in the judgment of the Director of the Office of Energy Projects does not conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, may be considered deficient. An applicant having a deficient application will be afforded additional time to correct deficiencies, not to exceed 45 days from the date of notification in the case of an application for a preliminary permit or exemption from licensing or 90 days from the date of notification in the case of an application for license. Notification will be by letter or, in the case of minor deficiencies, by telephone. Any notification will specify the deficiencies to be corrected. Deficiencies must be corrected by submitting the specified materials or information to the Secretary of the Commission within the time specified in the notification of deficiency in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at http://www.ferc.gov.\n\n(ii) Upon submission of a conforming application, action will be taken in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(iii) If the revised application is found not to conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, or if the revisions are not timely submitted, the revised application will be rejected. Procedures for rejected applications are specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii).\n\n(2) Patently deficient applications. (i) If, within 90 days of its filing date, the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that an application patently fails to substantially comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 of this part or § 16.8 of this chapter, or is for a project that is precluded by law, the application will be rejected as patently deficient with the specification of the deficiencies that render the application patently deficient. \n\n(ii) If, after 90 days of its filing date, the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that an application patently fails to substantially comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 of this part or § 16.8 of this chapter, or is for a project that is precluded by law: \n\n(A) The application will be rejected by order of the Commission, if the Commission determines it is patently deficient; or \n\n(B) The application will be considered deficient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the Commission determines it is not patently deficient. \n\n(iii) Any application that is rejected may be resubmitted if the deficiencies are corrected and if, in the case of a competing application, the resubmittal is timely. The date the rejected application is resubmitted will be considered the new filing date for purposes of determining its timeliness under § 4.36 and the disposition of competing applications under § 4.37.\n\n(f) Any application will be considered accepted for filing as of the application filing date if the Secretary receives all of the information and documents necessary to conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 within the time prescribed by the Commission or its delegate under paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(g) An applicant may be required to submit any additional information or documents that the Commission or its designee considers relevant for an informed decision on the application. The information or documents must take the form, and must be submitted within the time, that the Commission or its designee prescribes. An applicant may also be required to provide within a specified time additional copies of the complete application, or any of the additional information or documents that are filed, to the Commission or to any person, agency, or other entity that the Commission or its designee specifies. If an applicant fails to provide timely additional information, documents, or copies of submitted materials as required, the Commission or its designee may dismiss the application, hold it in abeyance, or take other appropriate action under this chapter or the Federal Power Act.\n\n(h) A prospective applicant, prior to submitting its application for filing, may seek advice from the Commission staff regarding the sufficiency of the application. For this purpose, five copies of the draft application should be submitted to the Director of the Division of Hydropower Licensing. An applicant or prospective applicant may confer with the Commission staff at any time regarding deficiencies or other matters related to its application. All conferences are subject to the requirements of § 385.2201 of this chapter governing ex parte communications. The opinions or advice of the staff will not bind the Commission or any person delegated authority to act on its behalf.\n\n(i) Intervention in any preliminary permit proceeding will not constitute intervention in any subsequent licensing or exemption proceeding.\n\n(j) Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.\n\n(k) Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. (1) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined in § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall omit the CEII from the information made available and insert the following in its place: \n\n(i) A statement that CEII is being withheld; \n\n(ii) A brief description of the omitted information that does not reveal any CEII; and \n\n(iii) This statement: “Procedures for obtaining access to Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) may be found at 18 CFR 388.113. Requests for access to CEII should be made to the Commission's CEII Coordinator.” \n\n(2) The applicant, in determining whether information constitutes CEII, shall treat the information in a manner consistent with any filings that applicant has made with the Commission and shall to the extent practicable adhere to any previous determinations by the Commission or the CEII Coordinator involving the same or like information. \n\n(3) The procedures contained in §§ 388.112 and 388.113 of this chapter regarding designation of, and access to, CEII, shall apply in the event of a challenge to a CEII designation or a request for access to CEII. If it is determined that information is not CEII or that a requester should be granted access to CEII, the applicant will be directed to make the information available to the requester. \n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any persons from voluntarily reaching arrangements or agreements calling for the disclosure of CEII.\n\n[Order 413, 50 FR 11678, Mar. 25, 1985] \n\n\nEditorial Note:For Federal Register citations affecting § 4.32, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.govinfo.gov.",

          "content": "§ 4.33   Limitations on submitting applications.\n(a) Limitations on submission and acceptance of a preliminary permit application. The Commission will not accept an application for a preliminary permit for project works that:\n\n(1) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is an unexpired preliminary permit.\n\n(2) Would interfere with a licensed project in a manner that, absent the licensee's consent, would be precluded by Section 6 of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(3) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which an initial development application has been filed unless the preliminary permit application is filed not later than the time allowed under § 4.36(a) for the filing of applications in competition against an initial application for a preliminary permit that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same resources.\n\n(b) Limitations on submissions and acceptance of a license application. The Commission will not accept an application for a license or project works that would develop, conserve, or utilize, in whole or part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is:\n\n(1) An unexpired preliminary permit, unless the permittee has submitted an application for license; or\n\n(2) An unexpired license, except as provided for in Section 15 of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(c) Limitations on submission and acceptance of an application for a license that would affect an exempted project. (1) Except as permitted under § 4.33(c)(2), § 4.94(d), or § 4.106 (c), (e) or (f), the Commission will not accept an application for a license for project works that are already exempted from licensing under this part.\n\n(2) If a project is exempted from licensing pursuant to § 4.103 or § 4.109 and real property interests in any non-Federal lands would be necessary to develop or operate the project, any person who is both a qualified license applicant and has any of those real property interests in non-Federal lands may submit a license application for that project. If a license application is submitted under this clause, any other qualified license applicant may submit a competing license application in accordance with § 4.36.\n\n(d) Limitations on submission and acceptance of exemption applications—(1) Unexpired permit or license. (i) If there is an unexpired permit in effect for a project, the Commission will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the permittee. Upon acceptance for filing of the permittee's application, the permit will be considered to have expired.\n\n(ii) If there is an unexpired license in effect for a project, the Commission will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the licensee.\n\n(2) Pending license applications. If an accepted license application for a project was submitted by a permittee before the preliminary permit expired, the Commission will not accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing submitted by a person other than the former permittee.\n\n(3) Submitted by qualified exemption applicant. If the first accepted license application for a project was filed by a qualified exemption applicant, the applicant may request that its license application be treated initially as an application for exemption from licensing by so notifying the Commission in writing and, unless only rights to use or occupy Federal lands would be necessary to develop and operate the project, by submitting documentary evidence showing that the applicant holds the real property interests required under § 4.31. Such notice and documentation must be submitted not later than the last date for filing protests or motions to intervene prescribed in the public notice issued for its license application under § 4.32(d)(2).\n\n(e) Priority of exemption applicant's earlier permit or license application. Any accepted preliminary permit or license application submitted by a person who later applies for exemption of the project from licensing will retain its validity and priority under this subpart until the preliminary permit or license application is withdrawn or the project is exempted from licensing.\n\n[Order 413, 50 FR 11680, Mar. 25, 1985, as amended by Order 499, 53 FR 27002, July 18, 1988; Order 2002, 68 FR 51116, Aug. 25, 2003; Order 699, 72 FR 45324, Aug. 14, 2007]",

The Commission may order a trial-type hearing on an application for a preliminary permit, a license, or an exemption from licensing upon either its own motion or the motion of any interested party of record. Any trial-type hearing will be limited to the issues prescribed by order of the Commission. In all other cases the hearings will be conducted by notice and comment procedures. \n\n(b) Notice and comment hearings. All comments (including mandatory and recommended terms and conditions or prescriptions) on an application for exemption or license must be filed with the Commission no later than 60 days after issuance by the Commission of public notice declaring that the application is ready for environmental analysis. All reply comments must be filed within 105 days of that notice. All comments and reply comments and all other filings described in this section must be served on all persons listed in the service list prepared by the Commission, in accordance with the requirements of § 385.2010 of this chapter. If a party or interceder (as defined in § 385.2201 of this Chapter) submits any written material to the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, the party or interceder must also serve a copy of the submission on this resource agency. The Commission may allow for longer comment or reply comment periods if appropriate. A commenter or reply commenter may obtain an extension of time from the Commission only upon a showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances in accordance with § 385.2008 of this chapter. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f)(1)(ii), and (f)(3) of this section, and late-filed terms and conditions or prescriptions will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1)(iv), (f)(1)(v), and (f)(2) of this section. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions will be considered by the Commission under section 10(a) of the Federal Power Act if such consideration would not delay or disrupt the proceeding. \n\n(1) Agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions and presentations. Any agency responsible for mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions for licenses or exemptions, pursuant to sections 4(e), 18, and 30(c) of the Federal Power Act and section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of l978, as amended, must provide these terms and conditions or prescriptions in its initial comments filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. In those comments, the agency must specifically identify and explain the mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions and their evidentiary and legal basis. In the case of an application prepared other than pursuant to part 5 of this chapter, if ongoing agency proceedings to determine the terms and conditions or prescriptions are not completed by the date specified, the agency must submit to the Commission by the due date:\n\n(i) Preliminary terms and conditions or prescriptions and a schedule showing the status of the agency proceedings and when the terms and conditions or prescriptions are expected to become final; or \n\n(ii) A statement waiving the agency's right to file the terms and conditions or prescriptions or indicating the agency does not intend to file terms and conditions or prescriptions. \n\n(2) Fish and Wildlife agencies and Indian tribes. All fish and wildlife agencies must set forth any recommended terms and conditions for the protection, mitigation of damages to, or enhancement of fish and wildlife, pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act, in their initial comments filed with the Commission by the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All Indian tribes must submit recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) by the same date. In those comments, a fish and wildlife agency or Indian tribe must discuss its understanding of the resource issues presented by the proposed facilities and the evidentiary basis for the recommended terms and conditions. \n\n(3) Other Government agencies and members of the public. Resource agencies, other governmental units, and members of the public must file their recommendations in their initial comments by the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The comments must clearly identify all recommendations and present their evidentiary basis. \n\n(4) Submittal of modified recommendations, terms and conditions or prescriptions. (i) If the information and analysis (including reasonable alternatives) presented in a draft environmental document, issued for comment by the Commission, indicate a need to modify the recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions previously submitted to the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, the agency, Indian tribe, or member of the public must file with the Commission any modified recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions on the proposed project (and reasonable alternatives) no later than the due date for comments on the draft environmental impact statement. Modified recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions must be clearly distinguished from comments on the draft document. \n\n(ii) If an applicant files an amendment to its application that would materially change the project's proposed plans of development, as provided in § 4.35, an agency, Indian tribe or member of the public may modify the recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions it previously submitted to the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section no later than the due date specified by the Commission for comments on the amendment. \n\n(5)(i) With regard to certification requirements under section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) for an application for a license or exemption from licensing, an applicant shall file within 60 days from the date of issuance of the notice of ready for environmental analysis:\n\n(A) A copy of the water quality certification or the certifying authority's express waiver;\n\n(B) A copy of the request for certification, including proof of the date on which the certifying authority received the request; or\n\n(C) Evidence of waiver of water quality certification as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section.\n\n(ii) In the case of an application process using the alternative procedures of paragraph 4.34(i), the filing requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(i) shall apply upon issuance of notice the Commission has accepted the application as provided for in paragraph 4.32(d) of this part.\n\n(iii) A certifying authority is deemed to have waived the certification requirements of section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act if the certifying authority has not denied, expressly waived, or granted certification by one year after the date the certifying authority received a written request for certification. If a certifying authority denies certification, the applicant must file a copy of the denial within 30 days after the applicant received it.\n\n(c) Additional procedures. If necessary or appropriate the Commission may require additional procedures (e.g., a pre-hearing conference, further notice and comment on specific issues or oral argument). A party may request additional procedures in a motion that clearly and specifically sets forth the procedures requested and the basis for the request. Replies to such requests may be filed within 15 days of the request. \n\n(d) Consultation procedures. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, the Commission will coordinate as appropriate with other government agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions for exemptions and licenses for hydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Commission will consult with fish and wildlife agencies concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on fish and wildlife and appropriate terms and conditions for license to adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat). Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Commission will consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on endangered or threatened species and their critical habitat. \n\n(e) Consultation on recommended fish and wildlife conditions; Section 10(j) process. (1) In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(2) The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions, and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.\n\n(3) Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental analysis. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.\n\n(4) The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone, or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this subsection to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.\n\n(5) The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(f) Licenses and exemption conditions and required findings—(1) License conditions. (i) All licenses shall be issued on the conditions specified in section 10 of the Federal Power Act and such other conditions as the Commission determines are lawful and in the public interest. \n\n(ii) Subject to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, fish and wildlife conditions shall be based on recommendations timely received from the fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. \n\n(iii) The Commission will consider the timely recommendations of resource agencies, other governmental units, and members of the public, and the timely recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) of Indian tribes affected by the project. \n\n(iv) Licenses for a project located within any Federal reservation shall be issued only after the findings required by, and subject to any conditions that may be timely received pursuant to, section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act. \n\n(v) The Commission will require the construction, maintenance, and operation by a licensee at its own expense of such fishways as may be timely prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act. \n\n(2) Exemption conditions. Any exemption from licensing issued for conduit facilities, as provided in section 30(b) of the Federal Power Act, or for small hydroelectric power projects having a proposed installed capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or less, as provided in section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, shall include such terms and conditions as the fish and wildlife agencies may timely determine are appropriate to carry out the responsibilities specified in section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(3) Required findings. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act. \n\n(g) Application. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) and (f) of this section apply only to applications for license or exemption; paragraph (e) applies only to applications for license. \n\n(h) Unless otherwise provided by statute, regulation or order, all filings in hydropower hearings, except those conducted by trial-type procedures, shall conform to the requirements of subpart T of part 385 of this chapter.\n\n(i) Alternative procedures. (1) An applicant may submit to the Commission a request to approve the use of alternative procedures for pre-filing consultation and the filing and processing of an application for an original, new or subsequent hydropower license or exemption that is subject to § 4.38 or § 16.8 of this chapter, or for the amendment of a license that is subject to the provisions of § 4.38. \n\n(2) The goal of such alternative procedures shall be to: \n\n(i) Combine into a single process the pre-filing consultation process, the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act and administrative processes associated with the Clean Water Act and other statutes; \n\n(ii) Facilitate greater participation by and improve communication among the potential applicant, resource agencies, Indian tribes, the public and Commission staff in a flexible pre-filing consultation process tailored to the circumstances of each case; \n\n(iii) Allow for the preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment by an applicant or its contractor or consultant, or of a preliminary draft environmental impact statement by a contractor or consultant chosen by the Commission and funded by the applicant; \n\n(iv) Promote cooperative efforts by the potential applicant and interested entities and encourage them to share information about resource impacts and mitigation and enhancement proposals and to narrow any areas of disagreement and reach agreement or settlement of the issues raised by the hydropower proposal; and \n\n(v) Facilitate an orderly and expeditious review of an agreement or offer of settlement of an application for a hydropower license, exemption or amendment to a license. \n\n(3) A potential hydropower applicant requesting the use of alternative procedures must: \n\n(i) Demonstrate that a reasonable effort has been made to contact all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and others affected by the applicant's proposal, and that a consensus exists that the use of alternative procedures is appropriate under the circumstances; \n\n(ii) Submit a communications protocol, supported by interested entities, governing how the applicant and other participants in the pre-filing consultation process, including the Commission staff, may communicate with each other regarding the merits of the applicant's proposal and proposals and recommendations of interested entities; and \n\n(iii) Serve a copy of the request on all affected resource agencies and Indian tribes and on all entities contacted by the applicant that have expressed an interest in the alternative pre-filing consultation process. \n\n(4) As appropriate under the circumstances of the case, the alternative procedures should include provisions for: \n\n(i) Distribution of an initial information package and conduct of an initial information meeting open to the public; \n\n(ii) The cooperative scoping of environmental issues (including necessary scientific studies), the analysis of completed studies and any further scoping; and \n\n(iii) The preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement and related application.\n\n(5)(i) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed prior to July 23, 2005, the Commission will give public notice in the Federal Register inviting comment on the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. The Commission will consider any such comments in determining whether to grant or deny the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. Such a decision will not be subject to interlocutory rehearing or appeal.\n\n(ii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and prior to the deadline date for filing a notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5 of this chapter, the Commission will give public notice and invite comments as provided for in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section. Commission approval of the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures prior to the deadline date for filing of the notification of intent does not waive the potential applicant's obligation to file the notification of intent required by § 5.5 of this chapter and Pre-Application Document required by § 5.6 of this chapter.\n\n(iii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and is at the same time as the notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5, the public notice and comment procedures of part 5 of this chapter shall apply.\n\n(6) If the Commission accepts the use of alternative procedures, the following provisions will apply. \n\n(i) To the extent feasible under the circumstances of the proceeding, the Commission will give notice in the Federal Register and the applicant will give notice, in a local newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the project is located, of the initial information meeting and the scoping of environmental issues. The applicant will also send notice of these stages to a mailing list approved by the Commission. \n\n(ii) Every six months, the applicant shall file with the Commission a report summarizing the progress made in the pre-filing consultation process and referencing the applicant's public file, where additional information on that process can be obtained. Summaries or minutes of meetings held in the process may be used to satisfy this filing requirement. The applicant must also file with the Commission a copy of its initial information package, each scoping document, and the preliminary draft environmental review document. All filings with the Commission under this section must include the number of copies required by paragraph (h) of this section, and the applicant shall send a copy of these filings to each participant that requests a copy. \n\n(iii) At a suitable location, the applicant will maintain a public file of all relevant documents, including scientific studies, correspondence, and minutes or summaries of meetings, compiled during the pre-filing consultation process. The Commission will maintain a public file of the applicant's initial information package, scoping documents, periodic reports on the pre-filing consultation process, and the preliminary draft environmental review document. \n\n(iv) An applicant authorized to use alternative procedures may substitute a preliminary draft environmental review document and additional material specified by the Commission instead of Exhibit E to its application and need not supply additional documentation of the pre-filing consultation process. The applicant will file with the Commission the results of any studies conducted or other documentation as directed by the Commission, either on its own motion or in response to a motion by a party to the licensing or exemption proceeding. \n\n(v) Pursuant to the procedures approved, the participants will set reasonable deadlines requiring all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and interested persons to submit to the applicant requests for scientific studies during the pre-filing consultation process, and additional requests for studies may be made to the Commission after the filing of the application only for good cause shown. \n\n(vi) During the pre-filing process the Commission may require the filing of preliminary fish and wildlife recommendations, prescriptions, mandatory conditions, and comments, to be submitted in final form after the filing of the application; no notice that the application is ready for environmental analysis need be given by the Commission after the filing of an application pursuant to these procedures. \n\n(vii) Any potential applicant, resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process may file a request with the Commission to resolve a dispute concerning the alternative process (including a dispute over required studies), but only after reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute with other participants in the process. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must document what efforts have been made to resolve the dispute. \n\n(7) If the potential applicant or any resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process can show that it has cooperated in the process but a consensus supporting the use of the process no longer exists and that continued use of the alternative process will not be productive, the participant may petition the Commission for an order directing the use by the potential applicant of appropriate procedures to complete its application. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must recommend specific procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances. \n\n(8) The Commission may participate in the pre-filing consultation process and assist in the integration of this process and the environmental review process in any case, including appropriate cases where the applicant, contractor, or consultant funded by the applicant is not preparing a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement, but where staff assistance is available and could expedite the proceeding. \n\n(9) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in § 4.32(k).\n\n[Order 533, 56 FR 23148, May 20, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 61155, Dec. 2, 1991; Order 540, 57 FR 21737, May 22, 1992; Order 596, 62 FR 59810, Nov. 5, 1997; Order 2002, 68 FR 51116, Aug. 25, 2003; Order 643, 68 FR 52094, Sept. 2, 2003; 68 FR 61742, Oct. 30, 2003; Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012; Order 800, 79 FR 59110, Oct. 1, 2014; 89 FR 96529, Dec. 5, 2024]",

An agency may request, in writing, along with any supporting documentation an extension of this 60-day period.\n\n(2) Rejected, withdrawn or dismissed applications. The Director of the Office of Energy Projects (Director) will, by letter, notify each fish and wildlife agency if a section 30(c) application is rejected, withdrawn or dismissed. Within 60 days from the date of notification, a fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency incurred prior to the date the application was rejected, withdrawn, or dismissed. An agency may submit a written request for an extension of this 60-day period along with any supporting documentation.\n\n(b) If an agency has not submitted a cost statement or extension request within the time provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it waives its right to receive fees for that project pursuant to this subpart.\n\n(c) Billing. After the Commission receives a cost statement from all fish and wildlife agencies as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will bill the section 30(c) applicant. The bill will show:\n\n(1) The cost statement submitted to the Commission by each fish and wildlife agency; \n\n(2) Any amounts already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302; and\n\n(3)(i) The amount due, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is less than the total of all the cost statements; or\n\n(ii) The amount to be refunded to the applicant, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is more than the total of all the cost statements.\n\n(d) Within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section, a section 30(c) applicant must pay in full to the Commission any remaining amounts due on the cost statements regardless of whether any of these amounts are in dispute.\n\n(e) Dispute procedures—(1) When to dispute. Any dispute regarding the reasonableness of any fish and wildlife agency cost statement must be made within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(2) Assessment of disputed cost statements The burden of showing that an agency's cost statement is unreasonable is on the applicant. However, a fish and wildlife agency must supply the disputing applicant and the Commission with the documentation necessary to support its cost statement. The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will determine the reasonableness of a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement. The Director's decision will be in writing. The Director will notify the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency of the decision by letter. Any decision of the Director may be appealed by either party pursuant to 18 CFR 385.1902. In deciding whether or not a disputed cost statement is reasonable, the Director will review the application, the disputed cost statement and any other documentation relating to the particular environmental problems associated with the disputing applicant's proposed project. The Director will consider such factors as:\n\n(i) The time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;\n\n(ii) The proportion of the cost statement to the time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;\n\n(iii) Whether the fish and wildlife agency's expenditures conform to Federal expenditure guidelines for such items as travel, per diem, personnel, and contracting; and\n\n(iv) Whether the studies conducted by the agency, if any, are duplicative, limited to the proposed project area, unnecessary to determine the impacts to or mitigation measures for the particular fish and wildlife resources affected by the proposed project, or otherwise unnecessary to set terms and conditions for the proposed project.\n\n(3) Unreasonable cost statements. If the Director determines that a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement is unreasonable, the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency will be afforded 45 days from the date of notification to attempt to reach an agreement regarding the reimbursable costs of the agency. If the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency fail to reach an agreement on the disputed cost statement within 45 days from the date of notification, the Director will determine the costs that the agency should reasonably have incurred.\n\n(f) Refunds. (1) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant under § 4.302 exceeds the total amount of the cost statements submitted by fish and wildlife agencies under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days from the date of the bill issued to the applicant under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(2) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant exceeds the amount determined to be reasonable by the Director pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days of the resolution of all dispute proceedings.\n\n[Order 487, 52 FR 48404, Dec. 22, 1987, as amended by Order 647, 69 FR 32438, June 10, 2004]",

          "content": "§ 11.1   Costs of administration.\n(a) Authority. Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program. \n\n(b) Scope. The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among: \n\n(1) All licensees of projects of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity; and \n\n(2) All holders of exemptions under either section 30 of the Federal Power Act or sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980, but only if the exemption was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 and is for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity. \n\n(3) If the exemption for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 but pursuant to an application filed prior to that date, the exemptee may credit against its annual charge any filing fee paid pursuant to § 381.601 of this chapter, which was removed effective April 21, 1995, 18 CFR 381.601 (1994), until the total of all such credits equals the filing fee that was paid. \n\n(c) Licenses and exemptions other than State or municipal. For licensees and exemptees, other than State or municipal: \n\n(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees or exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. \n\n(2) For each fiscal year the costs of administration determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assessed against such licenses or exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the total of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions. \n\n(3) The annual charge factor for each such project shall be found as follows: \n\n(i) For a conventional project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours. \n\n(ii) For a pure pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity. \n\n(iii) For a mixed conventional-pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its gross annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours less 75 times the annual energy used for pumped storage pumping in million of kilowatt-hours. \n\n(iv) For purposes of determining their annual charges factor, projects that are operated pursuant to an exemption will be deemed to have an annual energy output of zero. \n\n(4) To enable the Commission to determine such charges annually, each licensee whose authorized installed capacity exceeds 1.5 megawatts must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the gross amount of power generated (or produced by nonelectrical equipment) and the amount of power used for pumped storage pumping by the project during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt hours. If any licensee does not report the gross energy output of its project within the time specified above, the Commission's staff will estimate the energy output and this estimate may be used in lieu of the filings required by this section made by such licensee after November 1. \n\n(5) For unconstructed projects, the assessments begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence project construction, or as that deadline may be extended. For constructed projects, the assessments begin on the effective date of the license or exemption, except for any new capacity authorized therein. The assessments for new authorized capacity at licensed or exempted projects begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence construction of the new capacity. In the event that assessments begin during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated.\n\n(d) State and municipal licensees and exemptees. For State or municipal licensees and exemptees: \n\n(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the cost of administration under Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees and exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or that are fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. \n\n(2) An exemption will be granted to a licensee or exemptee to the extent, if any, to which it may be entitled under section 10(e) of the Act provided the data is submitted as requested in paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section. \n\n(3) For each fiscal year the total actual cost of administration as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be assessed against each such licensee or exemptee (except to the extent of the exemptions granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the proportion that the authorized installed capacity of each such project bears to the total such capacity under all such outstanding licenses or exemptions. \n\n(4) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptee for State or municipal purposes, each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours: \n\n(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project. \n\n(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc. \n\n(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows: \n\n(A) Used by licensee or exemptee. \n\n(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. \n\n(5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system, making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power, such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee. \n\n(6) The assessments commence on the date of commencement of project operation. In the event that project operation commences during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated based on the date on which operation commenced. \n\n(e) Transmission lines. For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license. \n\n(f) Maximum charge. No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted Commission costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge. \n\n(g) Commission's costs. (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. \n\n(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year 1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. \n\n(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act. \n\n(i) Definition. As used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, authorized installed capacity means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at best gate (maximum efficiency point) opening under the manufacturer's rated head times a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized installed capacity to reflect the change. \n\n(j) Transition. For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.\n\n[60 FR 15047, Mar. 22, 1995, as amended by Order 584, 60 FR 57925, Nov. 24, 1995; Order 815, 80 FR 63671, Oct. 21, 2015; Order 857, 84 FR 7991, Mar. 6, 2019]",

Annual charges for the use of government lands will be payable in advance, and will be set on the basis of an annual schedule of per-acre rental fees, as set forth in Appendix A of this part. The Executive Director will publish the updated fee schedule in the Federal Register.\n\n(c) The annual per-acre rental fee is the product of four factors: the adjusted per-acre value multiplied by the encumbrance factor multiplied by the rate of return multiplied by the annual adjustment factor.\n\n(1) Adjusted per-acre value. (i) Counties (or other geographical areas) are assigned a per-acre value based on their average per-acre land and building value published in the Census of Agriculture (Census) by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The adjusted per-acre value is computed by reducing the NASS Census land and building value by the sum of a state-specific modifier and seven percent. A table of state-specific adjustments will be available on the Commission's Web site.\n\n(ii) The state-specific modifier is a percentage reduction applicable to all counties or geographic areas in a state (except Puerto Rico), and represents the ratio of the total value of irrigated farmland in the state to the total value of all farmland in the state. The state-specific modifier will be recalculated every five years beginning in payment year 2016.\n\n(iii) The state-specific modifier for Puerto Rico is 13 percent.\n\n(iv) For all geographic areas in Alaska except for the Aleutian Islands Area, the Commission will calculate a statewide per-acre value based on the average per-acre land and building values published in the NASS Census for the Kenai Peninsula Area and the Fairbanks Area. This statewide per-acre value will be reduced by the sum of the state-specific modifier and seven percent. The resulting adjusted statewide per-acre value will be applied to all projects located in Alaska, except for projects located in the Aleutian Island Area.\n\n(2) Encumbrance factor. The encumbrance factor is 50 percent.\n\n(3) Rate of return. The rate of return is 5.77 percent through payment year 2025. The rate of return will be adjusted every 10 years thereafter, and will be based on the 10-year average of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the applicable NASS Census. For example, for years 2026 through 2035, the rate of return will be based on the 10-year average (2012-2021) of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the 2022 NASS Census. If the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate is not available, the next longest term Treasury bond available should be used in its place.\n\n(4) Annual adjustment factor. The annual adjustment factor is 1.9 percent through payment year 2015. For years 2016 through 2025, the annual adjustment factor is the annual change in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) for the ten years (2014-2023) preceding issuance (2024) of the most recent NASS Census (2022). Each subsequent ten year adjustment will be made in the same manner.\n\n(d) The annual charge for the use of Government lands for 2013 will be reduced by 25 percent for all licensees subject to this section.\n\n(e) The minimum annual charge for the use of Government lands under any license will be $25.\n\n[Order 774, 78 FR 5265, Jan. 25, 2013, as amended by Order 838, 83 FR 7, Jan. 2, 2018]",

(1) Any licensee whose non-Federal project uses a Government dam or other structure for electric power generation and whose annual charges are not already specified in final form in the license must pay the United States an annual charge for the use of that dam or other structure as determined in accordance with this section. Payment of such annual charge is in addition to any reimbursement paid by a licensee for costs incurred by the United States as a direct result of the licensee's project development at such Government dam.\n\n(2) Any licensee that is obligated under the terms of a license issued on or before September 16, 1986 to pay specified annual charges for the use of a Government dam must continue to pay the annual charges prescribed in the project license pending any readjustment of the annual charge for the project made pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(b) Graduated flat rates. Annual charges for the use of Government dams or other structures owned by the United States are 1 mill per kilowatt-hour for the first 40 gigawatt-hours of energy a project produces, 1\n1/2 mills per kilowatt-hour for over 40 up to and including 80 gigawatt-hours, and 2 mills per kilowatt-hour for any energy the project produces over 80 gigawatt-hours.\n\n(c) Information reporting. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each licensee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a sworn statement showing the gross amount of energy generated during the preceding fiscal year and the amount of energy provided free of charge to the Government. The determination of the annual charge will be based on the gross energy production less the energy provided free of charge to the Government. \n\n(2) A licensee who has filed these data under another section of part 11 or who has submitted identical data with FERC or the Energy Information Administration for the same fiscal year is not required to file the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Referenced filings should be identified by company name, date filed, docket or project number, and form, number. \n\n(d) Credits. A licensee may file a request with the Director of the Office of Energy Projects for a credit for contractual payments made for construction, operation, and maintenance of a Government dam at any time before 30 days after receiving a billing for annual charges determined under this section. The Director, or his designee, will grant such a credit only when the licensee demonstrates that a credit is reasonably justified. The Director, or his designee, shall consider, among other factors, the contractual arrangements between the licensee and the Federal agency which owns the dam and whether these arrangements reveal clearly that substantial payments are being made for power purposes, relevant legislation, and other equitable factors.\n\n[Order 379, 49 FR 22778, June 1, 1984, as amended by Order 379-A, 49 FR 33862, Aug. 27, 1984.

A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges upon one or more of the following grounds: \n\n(1) The project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation; \n\n(2) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was sold directly or indirectly to the public (ultimate consumer) without profit; \n\n(3) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was used by the licensee for State or municipal purposes. \n\n(b) Projects primarily for navigation. No State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that the project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation unless the licensee establishes that fact from the actual conditions under which the project was constructed and was operated during the calendar year for which the charge is made. \n\n(c) State or municipal use. A State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges for the project to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is used by the licensee itself for State or municipal purposes, such as lighting streets, highways, parks, public buildings, etc., for operating licensee's water or sewerage system, or in performing other public functions of the licensee. \n\n(d) Sales to public. No State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to the public without profit, unless such licensee shall show: \n\n(1) That it maintains an accounting system which segregates the operations of the licensed project and reflects with reasonable accuracy the revenues and expenses of the project; \n\n(2) That an income statement, prepared in accordance with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, shows that the revenues from the sale of project power do not exceed the total amount of operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, amortization, taxes, and interest on indebtedness, applicable to the project property. Periodic accruals or payments for redemption of the principal of bonds or other indebtedness may not be deducted in determining the net profit of the project. \n\n(e) Sales for resale. Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that electric power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to another State, municipality, person, or corporation for resale, unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to the ultimate consumer without profit. The matter of whether or not a profit was made is a question of fact to be established by the licensee. \n\n(f) Interchange of power. Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was supplied under an interchange agreement to a State, municipality, person, or corporation for sale at a profit (which power was not offset by an equivalent amount of power received under such interchange agreement) unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to ultimate consumers without profit. \n\n(g) Construction period. During the period when the licensed project is under construction and is not generating power, it will be considered as operating without profit within the meaning of this section, and licensee will be entitled to total exemption from the payment of annual charges, except as to those charges relating to the use of a Government dam or tribal lands within Indian reservations. \n\n(h) Optional showing. When the power from the licensed project enters into the electric power system of the State or municipal licensee, making it impracticable to meet the requirements set forth in this section with respect to the operations of the project only, such licensee may, in lieu thereof, furnish the same information with respect to the operations of said electric power system as a whole. \n\n(i) Application for exemption. Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. The application must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at http://www.ferc.gov within the time allowed (by § 11.20) for the payment of the annual charges. If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under § 11.21. If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.\n\n[Order 143, 13 FR 6681, Nov. 13, 1948.

(1) The Commission will assess or approve charges under this subpart for direct benefits derived from headwater projects constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee. Charges under this subpart will amount to an equitable part of the annual costs of interest, maintenance, and depreciation expenses of such headwater projects and the costs to the Commission of determining headwater benefits charges. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner of any non-Federal downstream project that receives headwater benefits must pay charges determined under this subpart.\n\n(2) Headwater benefits are the additional electric generation at a downstream project that results from regulation of the flow of the river by the headwater, or upstream, project, usually by increasing or decreasing the release of water from a storage reservoir.\n\n(b) Waiver and exemptions. The owner of a downstream project with installed generating capacity of 1.5 MW (2000 horsepower) or less or for which the Commission has granted an exemption from section 10(f) is not required to pay headwater benefits charges.\n\n(c) Definitions. For purposes of this subpart:\n\n(1) Energy gains means the difference between the number of kilowatt-hours of energy produced at a downstream project with the headwater project and that which would be produced without the headwater project.\n\n(2) Generation means gross generation of electricity at a hydroelectric project, including generation needed for station use or the equivalent for direct drive units, measured in kilowatt-hours. It does not include energy used for or derived from pumping in a pumped storage facility.\n\n(3) Headwater project costs means the total costs of an upstream project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or pre-1920 permittee.\n\n(4) Separable cost means the difference between the cost of a multiple-function headwater project with and without any particular function.\n\n(5) Remaining benefits means the difference between the separable cost of a specific function in a multiple-function project and the lesser of:\n\n(i) The benefits of that function in the project, as determined by the responsible Federal agency at the time the project or function was authorized; or\n\n(ii) The cost of the most likely alternative single-function project providing the same benefits.\n\n(6) Joint-use cost means the difference between the total project cost and the total separable costs. Joint-use costs are allocated among the project functions according to each function's percentage of the total remaining benefits.\n\n(7) Specific power cost means that portion of the headwater project costs that is directly attributable to the function of power generation at the headwater project, including, but not limited to, the cost of the electric generators, turbines, penstocks, and substation.\n\n(8) Joint-use power cost means the portion of the joint-use cost allocated to the power function of the project.\n\n(9) Section 10(f) costs means the annual interest, depreciation, and maintenance expense portion of the joint-use power cost, including costs of non-power functions required by statute to be paid by revenues from the power function.\n\n(10) Party means:\n\n(i) The owner of a non-Federal downstream hydroelectric project which is directly benefited by a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;\n\n(ii) The owner of a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;\n\n(iii) An operating agency of, or an agency marketing power from, a headwater project constructed by the United States; or\n\n(iv) Any party, as defined in § 385.102(c) of this chapter.\n\n(11) Final charge means a charge assessed on an annual basis to recover section 10(f) costs and which represents the final determination of the charge for the period for which headwater benefits are assessed. Final charges may be established retroactively, to finalize an interim charge, or prospectively.\n\n(12) Interim charge means a charge assessed to recover section 10(f) costs for a specified period of headwater benefits pending determination of a final charge for that period.\n\n(13) Investment cost means the sum of:\n\n(i) Project construction costs, including cost of land, labor and materials, cost of pre- and post-authorization investigations, and cost of engineering, supervision, and administration during construction of the project; and\n\n(ii) Interest during construction.\n\n[Order 453, 51 FR 24318, July 3, 1986, as amended by Order 699, 72 FR 45324, Aug. 14, 2007]",

This section applies to any determination of headwater benefits charges, unless:\n\n(1) The Commission has approved headwater benefits charges pursuant to an existing coordination agreement among the parties;\n\n(2) The parties reach, and the Commission approves, a settlement with respect to headwater benefits charges, pursuant to § 11.14(a) of this subpart; or\n\n(3) Charges may be assessed under § 11.14(b).\n\n(b) General rule—(1) Summary. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is determined under this subpart by apportioning the section 10(f) costs of the headwater project among the headwater project and all downstream projects that are not exempt from or waived from headwater benefits charges under § 11.10(b) of this chapter, according to each project's share of the total energy benefits to those projects resulting from the headwater project.\n\n(2) Calculation; headwater benefits formula. The annual headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is derived by multiplying the section 10(f) cost by the ratio of the energy gains received by the downstream project to the sum of total energy gains received by all downstream projects (except those projects specified in § 11.10(b) of this chapter) plus the energy generated at the headwater project that is assigned to the joint-use power cost, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIn which: \n\nP = annual payment to be made for headwater benefits received by a downstream project,\n\nCp = annual section 10(f) cost of the headwater project,\n\nEn = annual energy gains received at a downstream project, or group of projects if owned by one entity,\n\nEd = annual energy gains received at all downstream projects (except those specified in § 11.10(b) of this chapter), and\n\nEj = portion of the annual energy generated at the headwater project assigned to the joint-use power cost.\n(3) If power generation is not a function of the headwater project, section 10(f) costs will be apportioned only among the downstream projects.\n\n(4) If the headwater project is constructed after the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which any energy losses at the downstream project due to filling the headwater reservoir have been offset by subsequent energy gains. If the headwater project is constructed prior to the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which benefits are first realized by the downstream project.\n\n(5) No final charge assessed by the Commission under this subpart may exceed 85 percent of the value of the energy gains. If a party demonstrates, within the time specified in § 11.17(b)(3) for response to a preliminary assessment, that any final charge assessed under this subpart, not including the cost of the investigation assessed under § 11.17(c), exceeds 85 percent of the value of the energy gains provided to the downstream project for the period for which the charge is assessed, the Commission will reduce the charge to not more than 85 percent of the value. For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the energy gains is the cost of obtaining an equivalent amount of electricity from the most likely alternative source during the period for which the charge is assessed.",

(1) If the headwater project was constructed or is operated by the United States, and the Commission has not approved a settlement between the downstream project owner and the headwater project owner, the section 10(f) cost will be determined by deriving, from information provided by the headwater project owner pursuant to § 11.16 of this subpart, the joint-use power cost and the portion of the annual joint-use power cost that represents the interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the project. \n\n(2) If power is not an authorized function of the headwater project, the section 10(f) cost is the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation portion of the headwater project costs designated as the joint-use power cost, derived by deeming a power function at the project. The value of the benefits assigned to the deemed power function, for purposes of determining the value of remaining benefits of the joint-use power cost, is the total value of downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula. \n\n(3) For purposes of this paragraph, total value of downstream energy gains means the lesser of: \n\n(i) The cost of generating an equivalent amount of electricity at the most likely alternative facility at the time the headwater project became operational; or \n\n(ii) The incremental cost of installing electrical generation at the headwater project at the time the project became operational.",

(1) Energy gains at a downstream project are determined by simulating operation of the downstream project with and without the effects of the headwater project. Except for determinations which are not complex or in which headwater benefits are expected to be small, calculations will be made by application of the Headwater Benefits Energy Gains Model, as presented in The Headwater Benefits Energy Gains (HWBEG) Model Description and Users Manual, which is available for the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. \n\n(2) If more than one headwater project provide energy gains to a downstream project, the energy gains at the downstream project are attributed to the headwater projects according to the time sequence of commencement of operation in which each headwater project provided energy gains at the downstream project, by: \n\n(i) Crediting the headwater project that is first in time with the amount of energy gains that it provided to the downstream project prior to operation of the headwater project that is next in time; and \n\n(ii) Crediting any subsequent headwater project with the additional increment of energy gains provided by it to the downstream project. \n\n(3) Annual energy losses at a downstream project, or group of projects owned by the same entity, that are attributable to the headwater project will be subtracted from energy gains for the same annual period at the downstream project or group of projects.

          "content": "§ 11.17   Procedures for payment of charges and costs.\n(a) Payment for benefits from a non-Federal headwater project. Any billing procedures and payments determined between a non-Federal headwater project owner and a downstream project owner will occur according to the agreement of those parties.\n\n(b) Charges and payment for benefits from a Federal headwater project—(1) Interim charges. (i) If the Commission has not established a final charge and an investigation is pending, the Commission will issue a downstream project owner a bill for the interim charge and costs and a staff report explaining the calculation of the interim charge.\n\n(ii) An interim charge will be a percentage of the estimate by the Commission staff of what the final charge will be, as follows:\n\n(A) 100 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission previously has completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed; or\n\n(B) 80 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission has not completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed.\n\n(iii) When a final charge is established for a period for which an interim charge was paid, the Commission will apply the amount paid to the final charge.\n\n(2) Preliminary assessment of a final charge. Unless the project owner was assessed a final charge in the previous year, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner a preliminary assessment of any final charge when it is determined. A staff technical report explaining the basis of the assessment will be enclosed with the preliminary assessment. Copies of the preliminary assessment will be mailed to all parties.\n\n(3) Opportunity to respond. After issuance of a preliminary assessment of a final charge, parties may respond in writing within 60 days after the preliminary assessment.\n\n(4) Order and bill. (i) After the opportunity for written response by the parties to the preliminary assessment of a final charge, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. A bill will be issued for the amount of the final charge and costs.\n\n(ii) If a final charge is not established prospectively under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Commission will issue an order and a bill for the final charge and costs each year until prospective final charges are established. After the Commission issues an order establishing a prospective final charge, a bill will be issued annually for the amount of the final charge and costs.\n\n(5) Prospective final charges. When the Commission determines that historical data, including the hydrology, development, and other characteristics of the river basin, demonstrate sufficient stability to project average energy gains and section 10(f) costs, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge from future years. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. The prospective final charge will remain in effect until a new investigation is initiated under § 11.15(d)(2).\n\n(6) Payment under protest. Any payment of a final charge required by this section may be made under protest if a party is also appealing the final charge pursuant to § 385.1902, or requesting rehearing. If payment is made under protest, that party will avoid any penalty for failure to pay under § 11.21.\n\n(7) Accounting for payments pending appeal or rehearing. The Commission will retain any payment received for final charges from bills issued pursuant to this section in a special account. No disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made from the account until 31 days after the bill is issued. If an appeal under § 385.1902 or a request for rehearing is filed by any party, no disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made until final disposition of the appeal or request for rehearing.\n\n(c) Charges for costs of determinations of headwater benefits charges. (1) Any owner of a downstream project that benefits from a Federal headwater project must pay to the United States the cost of making any investigation, study, or determination relating to the assessment of the relevant headwater benefits charge under this subpart.\n\n(2) If any owner of a headwater or downstream project requests that the Commission determine headwater benefits charges for benefits provided by non-Federal headwater projects, the headwater project owners must pay a pro rata share of 50 percent of the cost of making the investigation and determination, in proportion to the benefits provided by their projects, and the downstream project owners must pay a pro rata share of the remaining 50 percent in proportion to the energy gains received by their projects.\n\n(3) Any charge assessed under this paragraph is separate from and will be added to, any final or interim charge under this subpart.",

          "content": "§ 35.12   Filing of initial rate schedules and tariffs.\n(a) The letter of a public utility transmitting to the Commission for filing an initial rate schedule or tariff shall list the documents submitted with the filing; give the date on which the service under that rate schedule or tariff is expected to commence; state the names and addresses of those to whom the rate schedule or tariff has been mailed; contain a brief description of the kinds of services to be furnished at the rates specified therein; and summarize the circumstances which show that all requisite agreement to the rate schedule or tariff or the filing thereof, including any contract embodied therein, has in fact been obtained. In the case of coordination and interchange arrangements in the nature of power pooling transactions, all supporting data required to be submitted in support of a rate schedule or tariff filing shall also be submitted by parties filing certificates of concurrence, or a representative to file supporting data on behalf of all parties may be designated as provided in § 35.1. \n\n(b) In addition, the following material shall be submitted: \n\n(1) Estimates of the transactions and revenues under an initial rate schedule. This shall include estimates, by months and for the year, of the quantities of services to be rendered and of the revenues to be derived therefrom during the 12 months immediately following the month in which those services will commence. Such estimates should be subdivided by classes of service, customers, and delivery points and shall show all billing determinants, e.g., kw, kwh, fuel adjustment, power factor adjustment. These estimates will not be required where they cannot be made with relative accuracy as, for example, in cases of interconnection arrangements containing schedules of rates for emergency energy, spinning reserve or economy energy or in cases of coordination and integration of hydroelectric generating resources whose output cannot be predicted quantitatively due to water conditions. \n\n(2)(i) Basis of the rate or charge proposed in an initial rate schedule or tariff and an explanation of how the proposed rate or charge was derived. For example, is it a standard rate of the filing public utility; is it a special rate arrived at through negotiations and, if so, were unusual customer requirements or competitive factors involved; and is it designed to produce a return substantially equal to the filing public utility's overall rate of return or is it essentially an increment cost plus a share of the savings rate? Were special cost of service studies prepared in connection with the derivation of the rate? \n\n(ii) A summary statement of all cost (whether fully distributed, incremental or other) computations involved in arriving at the derivation of the level of the rate, in sufficient detail to justify the rate, shall be submitted with the filing, except that if the filing includes nothing more than service to one or more added customers under an established rate of the utility for a particular class of service, such summary statement of cost computations is not required. In all cases, the Secretary is authorized to require the submission of the complete cost studies as part of the filing and each filing public utility shall submit the same upon request by the Secretary in such form as he or she shall direct. \n\n(3) A comparison of the proposed initial rate with other rates of the filing public utility for similar wholesale for resale and transmission services. \n\n(4) If any facilities are installed or modified in order to supply the service to be furnished under the proposed rate schedule or tariff, the filing public utility shall show on an appropriate available map (or sketch) and single line diagram the additions or changes to be made. \n\n(5) In support of the design of the proposed rate, the filing public utility shall submit the same material required to be furnished pursuant to § 35.13(h)(37) Statement BL. In addition to the summary cost analysis required by Statement BL, the public utility shall also submit a complete explanation as to the method used in arriving at the cost of service allocated to the sales and service for which the rate or charge is proposed, and showing the principal determinants used for allocation purposes. In connection therewith, the following data should be submitted: \n\n(i) In the event the filing public utility considers certain special facilities as being devoted entirely to the service involved, it shall show the cost of service related to such special facilities. \n\n(ii) Computations showing the energy responsibility of the service, based upon considerations of energy sales under the proposed rate schedule or tariff and the kWh delivered from the filing public utility's supply system. \n\n(iii) Computations showing the demand responsibility of the service, and explaining the considerations upon which such responsibility was determined (e.g., coincident or non-coincident peak demands, etc.). \n\n(Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 792-828c; Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352; E.O. 12009, 42 FR 46267; Pub.

Every public utility shall file the information required by this section, as applicable, at the time it files with the Commission under § 35.1 all or part of a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement to supersede or otherwise change the provisions of a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filed with the Commission under § 35.1. Any petition filed under § 385.207 of this chapter for waiver of any provision of this section shall specifically identify the requirement that the applicant wishes the Commission to waive.\n\n(1) Filing for any rate schedule change or tariff not otherwise excepted. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any utility that files a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement change shall submit with its filing the information specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of this section, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. \n\n(2) Abbreviated filing requirements—(i) For certain small rate increases. Any utility that files a rate increase for power or transmission services not covered by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section may elect to file under this paragraph instead of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the proposed increase for the Test Period, as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, is equal to or less than $200,000, regardless of customer consent, or equal to or less than $1 million if all wholesale customers that belong to the affected rate class consent. \n\n(A) Definition: The Test Period, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, means the most recent calendar year for which actual data are available, the last day of which is no more than fifteen months before the date of tender for filing under § 35.1 of the notice of rate schedule. \n\n(B) Any utility that elects to file under this subparagraph must file the following information, conforming its submission to any rule of general applicability and to any Commission order specifically applicable to such utility: \n\n(1) A complete cost of service analysis for the Test Period, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (h)(36), Statement BK, of this section. \n\n(2) A complete derivation and explanation of all allocation factors and special assignments, consistent with the information required in § 35.12(b)(5). \n\n(3) A complete calculation of revenues for the Test Period and for the first 12 months after the proposed effective date, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. \n\n(4) If the proposed rates contain a fuel cost or purchased economic power adjustment clause, as defined in § 35.14, the company must provide the derivation of its base cost of fuel (Fb) and its monthly fuel factors (Fm) for the Test Period and the resulting fuel adjustment clause revenues. If any pro forma adjustments affect the fuel clause in any way, the company must show the impact on Fm, kWh sales in the base period (Sm), Fb and kWh sales in the current period (Sb), as well as on fuel adjustment clause revenues. \n\n(5) Rate design calculations and narrative consistent with the information required in paragraph (h)(37) of this section and in § 35.12(b)(5). \n\n(6) The information required in paragraphs (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section and in § 35.12(b)(2). \n\n(C) Data shall be reconciled with the utility's most recent FERC Form 1. If the utility has not yet submitted Form 1 for the Test Period, the utility shall submit the relevant Form 1 pages in draft form. \n\n(D) The utility may make pro forma adjustments for post-Test Period changes that occur before the proposed effective date and that are known and measurable at the time of filing. The utility shall provide a narrative statement explaining all pro forma adjustments. \n\n(E) If the utility models its filing in whole or in part on retail rate decisions or settlements, the utility must provide detailed calculations and a narrative statement showing how all retail rate treatments are factored into the cost of service. \n\n(F) If the Commission sets the filing for hearing, the Commission will allow the company a specific time period in which to file testimony, exhibits, and supplemental workpapers to complete its case-in-chief. While not required under this subpart, a utility may elect to submit Statements AA through BM for the Test Period in accord with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) of this section. \n\n(ii) Rate increases for service of short duration or for interchange or coordination service. Any utility that files a rate increase for any service of short duration and of a type for which the need and usage cannot be reasonably forecasted (such as emergency or short-term power), or for service that is an integral part of a coordination and interchange arrangement, may submit with its filing only the information required in paragraphs (b), (c) and (h)(37) of this section and in § 35.12(b)(2) and (b)(5), conforming its submission to any rule of general applicability and to any Commission order specifically applicable to such utility. \n\n(iii) For rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement changes other than rate increases. Any utility that files a rate change that does not provide for a rate increase or that provides for a rate increase that is based solely on a change in delivery points, a change in delivery voltage, or a similar change in service, must submit with its filing only the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. \n\n(iv) Computing rate increases. For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any rate increase shall be the difference between the total revenues to be recovered under the rate change and the total revenues recovered or recoverable under the rate to be superseded or supplemented and shall be determined by: \n\n(A) applying the components of the rate to be superseded or supplemented to the billing determinants for the twelve months of Period I; \n\n(B) Applying the components of the rate change to the billing determinants for the twelve months of Period I; and \n\n(C) Subtracting the total revenues under subclause (A) from the total revenues under subclause (B). \n\n(3) Cost of service data required by letter. The Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation may, by letter, require a utility that is not required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to submit cost of service data to submit such specified cost of service data as are needed for Commission analysis of the rate schedule change. \n\n(b) General information. Any utility subject to paragraph (a) of this section shall file the following general information: \n\n(1) A list of documents submitted with the rate change; \n\n(2) The date on which the utility proposes to make the rate change effective; \n\n(3) The names and addresses of persons to whom a copy of the rate change has been posted; \n\n(4) A brief description of the rate change; \n\n(5) A statement of the reasons for the rate change; \n\n(6) A showing that all requisite agreement to the rate change, or to the filing of the rate change, including any agreement required by contract, has in fact been obtained; \n\n(7) A statement showing any expenses or costs included in the cost of service statements for Period I or Period II, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that have been alleged or judged in any administrative or judicial proceeding to be illegal, duplicative, or unnecessary costs that are demonstrably the product of discriminatory employment practices; and \n\n(c) Information relating to the effect of the rate change. Any utility subject to paragraph (a) of this section shall also file the following information or materials: \n\n(1) A table or statement comparing sales and services and revenues from sales and services under the rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement to be superseded and under the rate change, by applying the components of each such rate schedule or tariff to the billing determinants for each class of service, for each customer, and for each delivery point or set of delivery points that constitutes a billing unit: \n\n(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), for each of the twelve months immediately before and each of the twelve months immediately after the proposed effective date of the rate change, and the total for each of the two twelve month periods; or \n\n(ii) At the election of the utility: \n\n(A) If the utility files Statements BG and BH under paragraph (h) for Period I, for each of the twelve months of Period I instead of for the twelve months immediately before the proposed effective date of the rate change; and \n\n(B) If Period II is the test period, for each of the twelve months of Period II instead of for the twelve months immediately after the proposed effective date of the rate change; \n\n(2) A comparison of the rate change and the utility's other rates for similar wholesale for resale and transmission services; and \n\n(3) If any specifically assignable facilities have been or will be installed or modified in order to supply service under the rate change, an appropriate map or sketch and single line diagram showing the additions or changes to be made. \n\n(d) Cost of service information—(1) Filing of Period I data. Any utility that is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to submit cost of service information, or that is subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section but elects to file such information, shall submit Statements AA through BM under paragraph (h) of this section using: \n\n(i) Unadjusted Period I data; or \n\n(ii) Period I data adjusted to reflect changes that affect revenues and costs prior to the proposed effective date of the rate change and that are known and measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time the rate schedule change is filed, if such utility: \n\n(A) Is not required to and does not file Period II data; \n\n(B) Adjusts all Period I data to reflect such changes; and \n\n(C) Fully supports the adjustments in the appropriate cost of service statements. \n\n(2) Filing of Period II data. (i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, any utility that is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to submit cost of service information shall submit Statements AA through BM described in paragraph (h) using estimated costs and revenues for Period II; \n\n(ii) A utility may elect not to file Period II data if: \n\n(A) The utility files a rate increase that is less than one million dollars for Period I; or \n\n(B) All wholesale customers that belong to the affected rate class have consented to the rate increase. \n\n(3) Definitions. For purposes of this section: \n\n(i) Period I means the most recent twelve consecutive months, or the most recent calendar year, for which actual data are available, the last day of which is no more than fifteen months before the date of tender for filing under § 35.1 of the notice of rate change; \n\n(ii) Period II means any period of twelve consecutive months after the end of Period I that begins: \n\n(A) No earlier than nine months before the date on which the rate change is proposed to become effective; and \n\n(B) No later than three months after the date on which the rate change is proposed to become effective. \n\n(4) Test period. If Period II data are not submitted for Statements AA through BM, Period I shall be the test period. If Period II data are submitted for Statements AA through BM, Period II shall be the test period. \n\n(5) Work papers. A utility that files adjusted Period I data or that files Period II data shall submit all work papers relating to such data. The utility shall provide a comprehensive explanation of the bases for the adjustments or estimates and, if such adjustments or estimates are based on a regularly prepared corporate budget, shall include relevant excerpts from such budget. Work papers and documents containing additional explanatory material shall be provided in electronic format, shall be legible, shall be assigned page numbers, and shall be marked, organized and indexed according to: \n\n(A) Subject matter; \n\n(B) The cost of service statements to which they apply; and \n\n(C) Witness. \n\n(6) Attestation. A utility shall include in its filing an attestation by its chief accounting officer or another of its officers that, to the best of that officer's knowledge, information, and belief, the cost of service statements and supporting data submitted under this paragraph are true, accurate, and current representations of the utility's books, budgets, or other corporate documents. \n\n(e) Testimony and exhibits—(1) Filing requirements. (i) A utility subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall file Statements AA through BM under paragraph (h) as exhibits with its rate change and may file any other exhibits in support of its rate schedule change. \n\n(ii) A utility subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall file prepared testimony. Such testimony shall include an explanation of all exhibits, including Statements AA through BM, and shall include support for all adjustments to book or budgeted data relied on in preparing the exhibits. \n\n(iii) To the extent that testimony and exhibits other than Statements AA through BM duplicate information required to be submitted in such statements, the testimony and exhibits may incorporate such information by referencing the specific statement containing such material. \n\n(2) Case in chief. In order to avoid delay in processing rate filings, such cost of service statements, testimony, and other exhibits described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be the utility's case in chief in the event the matter is set for hearing. \n\n(3) Burden of proof. Any utility that files a rate increase shall be prepared to go forward at a hearing on reasonable notice on the data submitted under this section, to sustain the burden of proof under the Federal Power Act of establishing that the rate increase is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential or otherwise unlawful within the meaning of the Act. \n\n(f) Filing by parties concurring in coordination and interchange arrangements. For coordination and interchange arrangements in the nature of power pooling transactions, all information required to be submitted in support of a rate change under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section shall be submitted by each party filing a certificate of concurrence under § 35.1. If a representative is designated and authorized in accordance with § 35.1 to file supporting information on behalf of all parties to a rate change, such filing shall fulfill the requirement in this paragraph for individual submittals by each party. \n\n(g) Commission precedents and policy. If a utility submits cost of service data under paragraph (d) of this section, it shall conform all such submissions to any rule of general applicability and to any Commission order specifically applicable to such utility. \n\n(h) Cost of service statements. Any utility subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall submit the following Statements AA through BM in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section. \n\n(1) Statement AA—Balance sheets. Statement AA consists of balance sheets as of the beginning and the end of both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available balance sheet, including any applicable notes, and an explanation of any significant accounting changes since the most recent filing by the utility under this section that involves the same wholesale customer rate class. Balance sheets shall be constructed in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141. \n\n(2) Statement AB—Income statements. Statement AB consists of income statements for both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available income statement, including any applicable notes, and an explanation of any significant accounting changes since the most recent filing by the utility under this section that involves the same wholesale customer rate class. Income statements shall be prepared in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141. \n\n(3) Statement AC—Retained earnings statements. Statement AC consists of retained earnings statements for both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available retained earnings statement, including any notes applicable thereto. Retained earnings statements shall be prepared in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141. \n\n(4) Statement AD—Cost of plant. Statement AD is a statement of the original cost of total electric plant in service according to functional classification for Period I and Period II. If the plant functions and subfunctions for Period I and Period II are different, the utility shall explain and justify the differences. \n\n(i) For each separately identified function and subfunction of production plant or transmission plant, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning of the first month and the end of each month of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the thirteen balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II thirteen monthly balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances. \n\n(ii) For each separately identified function and subfunction of plant other than production or transmission, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning and the end of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the beginning and end balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances. \n\n(iii) The utility shall show the electric plant in service in accordance with each of the following five major functional classifications: \n\n(A) Production; \n\n(B) Transmission; \n\n(C) Distribution; \n\n(D) General and Intangible; and \n\n(E) Common and Other. \n\n(iv) To the extent feasible, the utility shall show completed construction not classified in accordance with clause (iii) in accordance with tentative classification to major functional accounts. If this is not feasible, the utility shall describe such facilities as other plant under clause (iii)(E). \n\n(v) If a utility designs its rate change so that subdivision of the major functional classifications is necessary to support the changed rate, the utility shall supply the original cost information for any of the five major functional plant classifications in clause (iii) that are divided into subfunctional categories. If subfunctional original cost information is provided, the utility shall explain the importance of providing such information to support the changed rate. The utility shall describe each subfunctional category in substantive terms, such as steam electric production or high voltage transmission. \n\n(vi) The utility shall select any subfunctional categories, as appropriate, under the following criteria: \n\n(A) Production plant categories shall be established as necessary to segregate costs for production services with special characteristics, such as base, intermediate or peaking load. The utility shall provide a description of each such service and shall list a brief descriptive title for each corresponding subfunctional category. \n\n(B) Transmission plant categories shall be chosen to reflect the extent to which the facilities are proposed to be allocated on a common basis among all or specific segments of utility services. For descriptive purposes, plant may also be categorized according to accounting or engineering terminology, such as high voltage overhead lines. The utility shall provide brief descriptive transmission category titles and explain the basis for the titles. If a utility allocates all transmission plant among utility services on the basis of a single set of allocation data, the utility may show original cost in total without subfunctionalization. \n\n(C) Distribution plant categories shall be selected according to engineering or use characteristics meaningful for allocations or assignments to wholesale services such as substations, overhead lines, meters, or non-wholesale. The utility shall provide brief descriptive distribution category titles and shall explain the basis for the titles. \n\n(D) If the utility divides any general, intangible, common, and other plant functional classifications into subfunctional categories, the subfunctional categories shall be chosen to group together facilities that share a common basis for allocation between wholesale and other electric services. The utility shall provide a brief descriptive title for each general and intangible subfunctional category, and for each common and other subfunctional category, with an explanation of the basis of each category selection. A utility need not divide the functional classifications of plant into subfunctional categories if these functions of plant are allocated in Statement BK on the basis of utility labor expenses. \n\n(E) A separate category shall be provided for each specific assignment of plant reported in Statement BE. Such assignments are applicable principally but not necessarily exclusively to distribution facilities.

Comparisons shall include at least the following items, accompanied by explanatory notes with respect to significant variations among the comparative percentages: \n\n(A) Rate base; \n\n(B) Production expenses; \n\n(C) Transmission expenses; \n\n(D) Customer accounting, customer service and information, and sales expenses; \n\n(E) Depreciation expenses; \n\n(F) Taxes except income and revenue; \n\n(G) Income taxes; \n\n(H) Revenue taxes; and \n\n(I) Return claimed. \n\n(37) Statement BL—Rate design information. In support of the design of the changed rate, the utility shall submit the following material: \n\n(i) A narrative statement describing and justifying the objectives of the design of the changed rate. If the purpose of the rate design is to reflect costs, the utility shall state how that objective is achieved, and shall accompany it with a summary cost analysis that would justify the rate design, including any discounts or surcharges based on delivery voltage level or other specific considerations. Such summary cost analysis shall be consistent with, derived from, and cross-referenced to the data in cost of service Statement BK. If the rate design is not intended to reflect costs, whether fully distributed, marginal, incremental, or other, the utility shall provide a statement to justify the departure from cost-based rates. \n\n(ii) If the billing determinants, such as quantities of demand, energy, or delivery points, are on different bases than the cost allocation determinants supporting such charges, the utility shall submit an explanation setting forth the economic or other considerations that warrant such departure. The information shall include at least the following: \n\n(A) If the individual rate for the demand, energy and customer charges do not correspond to the comparable cost classifications supporting such charges, a detailed explanation stating the reasons for the differences. \n\n(B) If the changed rate contains more than one demand or energy block, a detailed explanation indicating the rationale for the blocking and the considerations upon which such blocking is based, including adequate cost support for the specified blocking.\n\n(38) Statement BM—Construction program statement. Statement BM is a summary of data and supporting assumptions relating to the economics of any construction program to replace or expand the utility's power supply that shall be filed if the utility is filing for construction work in progress in rate base under § 35.26(c)(3) of this chapter. The filing utility shall describe generally its program for providing reliable and economic power for the period beginning with the date of the filing and ending with the tenth year after the test period. The statement shall include an assessment of the relative costs of adopting alternative strategies including an analysis of alternative production plant, e.g., cogeneration, small power production, heightened load management and conservation efforts, additions to transmission plant or increased purchases of power, and an explanation of why the program adopted is prudent and consistent with a least-cost energy supply program.\n\n(Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 791-828c; Dept. of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352; E.O. 12009, 42 FR 46267, 3 CFR 142 (1978); Pub.

          "content": "§ 35.14   Fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clauses.\n(a) Fuel adjustment clauses (fuel clause) which are not in conformity with the principles set out below are not in the public interest. These regulations contemplate that the filing of proposed rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements which embody fuel clauses failing to conform to the following principles may result in suspension of those parts of such rate schedules, tariffs, or service agreements: \n\n(1) The fuel clause shall be of the form that provides for periodic adjustments per kWh of sales equal to the difference between the fuel and purchased economic power costs per kWh of sales in the base period and in the current period: \n\nAdjustment Factor = Fm/Sm-Fb/Sb\n\n\nWhere: F is the expense of fossil and nuclear fuel and purchased economic power in the base (b) and current (m) periods; and S is the kWh sales in the base and current periods, all as defined below.\n(2) Fuel and purchased economic power costs (F) shall be the cost of: \n\n(i) Fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in the utility's own plants, and the utility's share of fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in jointly owned or leased plants. \n\n(ii) The actual identifiable fossil and nuclear fuel costs associated with energy purchased for reasons other than identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. \n\n(iii) The total cost of the purchase of economic power, as defined in paragraph (a)(11) of this section, if the reserve capacity of the buyer is adequate independent of all other purchases where non-fuel charges are included in either Fb or Fm;\n\n(iv) Energy charges for any purchase if the total amount of energy charges incurred for the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost; \n\n(v) And less the cost of fossil and nuclear fuel recovered through all inter-system sales. \n\n(3) Sales (S) must be all kWh's sold, excluding inter-system sales. Where for any reason, billed system sales cannot be coordinated with fuel costs for the billing period, sales may be equated to the sum of: (i) Generation, (ii) purchases, (iii) exchange received, less (iv) energy associated with pumped storage operations, less (v) inter-system sales referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, less (vi) total system losses.\n\n(4) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure shall be modified to properly allow for losses (estimated if necessary) associated only with wholesale sales for resale. \n\n(5) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure may be further modified to allow the recovery of gross receipts and other similar revenue based tax charges occasioned by the fuel adjustment revenues. \n\n(6) The cost of fossil fuel shall include no items other than those listed in Account 151 of the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees. The cost of nuclear fuel shall be that as shown in Account 518, except that if Account 518 also contains any expense for fossil fuel which has already been included in the cost of fossil fuel, it shall be deducted from this account. (Paragraph C of Account 518 includes the cost of other fuels used for ancillary steam facilities.) \n\n(7) Where the cost of fuel includes fuel from company-owned or controlled \n1\n sources, that fact shall be noted and described as part of any filing. Where the utility purchases fuel from a company-owned or controlled source, the price of which is subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body, and where the price of such fuel has been approved by that regulatory body, such costs shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be reasonable and includable in the adjustment clause. If the current price, however, is in litigation and is being collected subject to refund, the utility shall so advise the Commission and shall keep a separate account of such amounts paid which are subject to refund, and shall advise the Commission of the final disposition of such matter by the regulatory body having jurisdiction. With respect to the price of fuel purchases from company-owned or controlled sources pursuant to contracts which are not subject to regulatory authority, the utility company shall file such contracts and amendments thereto with the Commission for its acceptance at the time it files its fuel clause or modification thereof. Any subsequent amendment to such contracts shall likewise be filed with the Commission as a rate schedule change and may be subject to suspension under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Fuel charges by affiliated companies which do not appear to be reasonable may result in the suspension of the fuel adjustment clause or cause an investigation thereof to be made by the Commission on its own motion under section 206 of the Federal Power Act. \n\n\n\n1 As defined in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts 18 CFR part 101, Definitions 5B.\n(8) All rate filings which contain a proposed new fuel clause or a change in an existing fuel clause shall conform such clauses with the regulations. Within one year of the effectiveness of this rulemaking, all public utilities with rate schedules that contain a fuel clause should conform such clauses with the regulations. Recognizing that individual public utilities may have special operating characteristics that may warrant granting temporary delays in the implementation of the regulations, the Commission may, upon showing of good cause, waive the requirements of this section of the regulations for an additional one-year period so as to permit the public utilities sufficient time to adjust to the requirements. \n\n(9) All rate filings containing a proposed new fuel clause or change in an existing fuel clause shall include: \n\n(i) A description of the fuel clause with detailed cost support for the base cost of fuel and purchased economic power or energy. \n\n(ii) Full cost of service data unless the utility has had the rate approved by the Commission within a year, provided that such cost of service may not be required when an existing fuel cost adjustment clause is being modified to conform to the Commission's regulations. \n\n(10) Whenever particular circumstances prevent the use of the standards provided for herein, or the use thereof would result in an undue burden, the Commission may, upon application under § 385.207 of this chapter and for good cause shown, permit deviation from these regulations. \n\n(11) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(i) Economic power is power or energy purchased over a period of twelve months or less where the total cost of the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost. \n\n(ii) Total cost of the purchase is all charges incurred in buying economic power and having such power delivered to the buyer's system. The total cost includes, but is not limited to, capacity or reservation charges, energy charges, adders, and any transmission or wheeling charges associated with the purchase. \n\n(iii) Total avoided variable cost is all identified and documented variable costs that would have been incurred by the buyer had a particular purchase not been made. Such costs include, but are not limited to, those associated with fuel, start-up, shut-down or any purchases that would have been made in lieu of the purchase made.\n\n(12) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following procedures and instructions apply: \n\n(i) A utility proposing to include purchase charges other than those for fuel or energy in fuel and purchased economic power costs (F) under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall amend its fuel cost adjustment clause so that it is consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Such amendment shall state the system reserve capacity criteria by which the system operator decides whether a reliability purchase is required. Where the utility filing the statement is required by a State or local regulatory body (including a plant site licensing board) to file a capacity criteria statement with that body, the system reserve capacity criteria in the statement filed with the Commission shall be identical to those contained in the statement filed with the State or local regulatory body. Any utility that changes its reserve capacity criteria shall, within 45 days of such change, file an amended fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clause to incorporate the new criteria. \n\n(ii) Reserve capacity shall be deemed adequate if, at the time a purchase was initiated, the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria were projected to be satisfied for the duration of the purchase without the purchase at issue. \n\n(iii) The total cost of the purchase must be projected to be less than total avoided variable cost, at the time a purchase was initiated, before any non-fuel purchase charge may be included in Fm. \n\n(iv) The purchasing utility shall make a credit to Fm after a purchase terminates if the total cost of the purchase exceeds the total avoided variable cost. The amount of the credit shall be the difference between the total cost of the purchase and the total avoided variable cost. This credit shall be made in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase. If a utility fails to make the credit in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase, it shall, when making the credit, also include in Fm interest on the amount of the credit. Interest shall be calculated at the rate required by § 35.19a(a)(2)(iii) of this chapter, and shall accrue from the date the credit should have been made under this paragraph until the date the credit is made.\n\n(v) If a purchase is made of more capacity than is needed to satisfy the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria because the total costs of the extra capacity and associated energy are less than the buyer's total avoided variable costs for the duration of the purchase, the charges associated with the non-reliability portion of the purchase may be included in F.\n\n(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1902-0096)\n\n(Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 824d, 824e and 825h (1976 & Supp. IV 1980); Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7171, 7172 and 7173(c) (Supp. IV 1980); E.O. 12009, 3 CFR part 142 (1978); 5 U.S.C. 553 (1976))\n\n[Order 271, 28 FR 10573, Oct. 2, 1963, as amended by Order 421, 36 FR 3047, Feb. 17, 1971; 39 FR 40583, Nov. 19, 1974; Order 225, 47 FR 19056, May 3, 1982; Order 352, 48 FR 55436, Dec. 13, 1983; 49 FR 5073, Feb. 10, 1984; Order 529, 55 FR 47321, Nov. 13, 1990; Order 600, 63 FR 53809, Oct. 7, 1998; Order 714, 73 FR 57532, Oct. 3, 2008; 73 FR 63886, Oct. 28, 2008]",

When a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof required to be on file with the Commission is proposed to be cancelled or is to terminate by its own terms and no new rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof is to be filed in its place, a filing must be made to cancel such rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof at least sixty days but not more than one hundred-twenty days prior to the date such cancellation or termination is proposed to take effect. A copy of such notice to the Commission shall be duly posted. With such notice, each filing party shall submit a statement giving the reasons for the proposed cancellation or termination, and a list of the affected purchasers to whom the notice has been provided. For good cause shown, the Commission may by order provide that the notice of cancellation or termination shall be effective as of a date prior to the date of filing or prior to the date the filing would become effective in accordance with these rules.\n\n(b) Applicability.

This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance. \n\n(b) Implementation Procedures. (1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making an abbreviated filing must:\n\n(i) Clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;\n\n(ii) Submit the revisions in accordance with § 35.7; and\n\n(iii) Identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.\n\n(2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so. \n\n(3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal. \n\n[59 FR 65938, Dec. 22, 1994, as amended by Order 714, 73 FR 57533, Oct. 3, 2008]",

(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, this section applies, with respect to rate schedules filed under §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, to the ratemaking treatment of the tax effects of all transactions for which there are timing differences.\n\n(2) This section does not apply to the following timing differences:\n\n(i) Differences that result from the use of accelerated depreciation;\n\n(ii) Differences that result from the use of Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(iii) Differences that result from the use of accelerated amortization provisions on certified defense and pollution control facilities;\n\n(iv) Differences that arise from recognition of extraordinary property losses as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred and amortized expense for book purposes;\n\n(v) Differences that arise from recognition of research, development, and demonstration expenditures as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred and amortized expense for book purposes;\n\n(vi) Differences that result from different tax and book reporting of deferred gains or losses from disposition of utility plant;\n\n(vii) Differences that result from the use of the Asset Guideline Class “Repair Allowance” provision of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(viii) Differences that result from recognition of purchased gas costs as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred expense for book purposes.\n\n\n(See Order 13, issued October 18, 1978; Order 203, issued May 29, 1958; Order 204, issued May 29, 1958; Order 404, issued May 15, 1970; Order 408, issued August 26, 1970; Order 432, issued April 23, 1971; Order 504, issued February 11, 1974; Order 505, issued February 11, 1974; Order 566, issued June 3, 1977; Opinion 578, issued June 3, 1970; and Opinion 801, issued May 31, 1977.)\n(b) General rules—(1) Tax normalization required. (i) A public utility must compute the income tax component of its cost of service by using tax normalization for all transactions to which this section applies.\n\n(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, application of tax normalization by a public utility under this section to compute the income tax component will not be subject to case-by-case adjudication.\n\n(2) Reduction of, and addition to, rate base. (i) The rate base of a public utility using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property;” Account 282, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other property;” and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base. \n\n(ii) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction or other jurisdictional activities.\n\n(iii) If a public utility uses an approved purchased gas adjustment clause or a research, development and demonstration tracking clause, the rate base reductions or additions required under this subparagraph must apply only to the extent that the balances in Account 190 and Accounts 281 through 283 are not used, for purposes of calculating carrying charges, as an offset to balances properly recordable in Account 188, “Research development and demonstration expenditures,” or Account 191, “Unrecovered purchased gas costs.”\n\n(c) Special rules. (1) This paragraph applies:\n\n(i) If the public utility has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization been applied for the tax effects of timing difference transactions originating at any time prior to the test period; or\n\n(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in or in excess of amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities as determined by application of the current tax rate to all timing difference transactions originating in the test period and prior to the test period.\n\n(2) The public utility must compute the income tax component in its cost of service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes described in subparagraphs (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph.\n\n(3) The public utility must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the public utility for determining the cost of service provision described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the public utility, then the public utility must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of this method will be subject to case-by-case determination.\n\n(d) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) Tax normalization means computing the income tax component as if the amounts of timing difference transactions recognized in each period for ratemaking purposes were also recognized in the same amount in each such period for income tax purposes.\n\n(2) Timing differences means differences between amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for ratemaking purposes, which differences arise in one time period and reverse in one or more other time periods so that the total amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and for ratemaking purposes are equal.\n\n(3) Commission-approved ratemaking method means a ratemaking method approved by the Commission in a final decision including approval of a settlement agreement containing a ratemaking method only if such settlement agreement applies that method beyond the effective term of the settlement agreement.\n\n(4) Income tax purposes means for the purpose of computing income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).\n\n(5) Income tax component means that part of the cost of service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.\n\n(6) Ratemaking purposes means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, approving, disapproving or rejecting rates under the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act.\n\n(7) Tax effect means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction.\n\n(8) Transaction means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry that is used in determining revenues or expenses.\n\n[46 FR 26636, May 14, 1981.

          "content": "§ 35.25   Construction work in progress.\n(a) Applicability. This section applies to any rate schedule filed under this part by any public utility as defined in subsection 201(e) of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section: \n\n(1) Constuction work in progress or CWIP means any expenditure for public utility plant in process of construction that is properly included in Accounts 107 (construction work in progress) and 120.1 (nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication) of part 101 of this chapter, the Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Major and Nonmajor), that would otherwise be eligible for allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) treatment. \n\n(2) Double whammy means a situation which may arise when a wholesale electric rate customer embarks upon its own or participates in a construction program to supply itself with all or a portion of its future power needs, thereby reducing its future dependence on the CWIP of the rate applicant, but is simultaneously forced to pay to the CWIP public utility rate applicant the CWIP portion of the wholesale rates that reflects existing levels of service or a different anticipated service level.\n\n(3) Fuel conversion facility means any addition to public utility plant that enables a natural gas-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, or that enables an oil-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, other than natural gas. Such facilities include those that alter internal plant workings, such as oil or coal burners, soot blowers, bottom ash removal systems and concomitant air pollution control facilities, and any facility needed for receiving and storing the fuel to which the plant is being converted, which facility would not be necessary if the plant continued to burn gas or oil.\n\n(4) Pollution control facility means an identifiable structure or portions of a structure that is designed to reduce the amount of pollution produced by the power plant, but does not include any facility that reduces pollution by substituting a different method of generation or that generates the additional power necessitated by the operation of a pollution control facility.\n\n(c) General rule. For purposes of any initial rate schedule or any rate schedule change filed under § 35.12 or § 35.13 of this part, a public utility may include in its rate base any costs of construction work in progress (CWIP), including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), as provided in this section.\n\n(1) Pollution control facilities—(i) General rule. Any CWIP for pollution control facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.\n\n(ii) Qualification as a pollution control facility. In determining whether a facility is a pollution control facility for purposes of this section, the Commission will consider:\n\n(A) Whether such facility is the type facility described in the Internal Revenue Service laws, 26 U.S.C. 169(d)(1), as follows:\n\n\n“A new identifiable treatment facility which is used * * * to abate or control water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing, storing, or preventing the creation or emission of pollutants, contaminants, wastes or heat”;\n(B) Whether such facility has been certified by a local, state, or federal agency as being in conformity with, or required by, a program of pollution control;\n\n(C) Other evidence showing that such facilities are for pollution control.\n\n(2) Fuel conversion facilities. Any CWIP for fuel conversion facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.\n\n(3) Non-pollution control of fuel conversion (non-PC/FC) CWIP. No more than 50 percent of any CWIP allocable to electric power sales for resale not otherwise included in rate base under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, may be included in the rate base of the public utility.\n\n(4) Forward looking allocation ratios. Every test period CWIP project requested for wholesale rate base treatment pursuant to § 35.26(c)(1), (2), and (3) of this part will be allocated to the customer classes on the basis of forward looking allocation ratios reflecting the anticipated average annual use the wholesale customers will make of the system over the estimated service life of the project. Supporting documentation, as required by §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, must be in sufficient detail to permit examination and verification of the forward looking allocation ratio's recognition of each wholesale customer's plans, if any, for future alternative or supplementary power supplies. For the purpose of preventing anticompetitive effects, including CWIP-induced price squeeze and double whammy, sufficient recognition of such plans may require the public utility applicant to provide for separate customer groups or provide for a rate design incorporating selected CWIP project credits.\n\n(d) Effective date. If a public utility proposes in its filed rates to include CWIP in rate base under this section, that portion of the rate related to CWIP is collectible at the time the general rates become effective pursuant to Commission order, whether or not subject to refund, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(e) Discontinuance of AFUDC. On the date that any proposed rate that includes CWIP in rate base becomes effective, a public utility that has included CWIP in rate base must discontinue the capitalization of any AFUDC related to those amounts of CWIP is rate base.\n\n(f) Accounting procedures. When a public utility files to include CWIP in its rate base pursuant to this section, it must propose accounting procedures in that rate schedule filing that:\n\n(1) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for both capitalized AFUDC and corresponding amounts of CWIP proposed to be included in rate base; and\n\n(2) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for any corresponding AFUDC capitalized as a result of different accounting or ratemaking treatments accorded CWIP by state or local regulatory authorities.\n\n(g) Anticompetitive procedures—(1) Filing requirements. In order to facilitate Commission review of the anticompetitive effects of applications for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), a public utility applying for rates based upon inclusion of such CWIP in rate base must include the following information in its filing:\n\n(i) The percentage of the proposed increase in the jurisdictional rate level attributable to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP and the percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP supporting the proposed rate level;\n\n(ii) The percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP permitted by the state or local commission supporting the current retail rates of the public utility against which the relevant wholesale customers compete; and\n\n(iii) Individual earned rate of return analyses of each of the competing retail rates developed on a basis fully consistent with the wholesale cost of service for the same test period if the requested percentage of wholesale non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP exceeds that permitted by the relevant state or local authority to support the currently competing retail rates.\n\n(2) Preliminary relief. (i) If an intervenor in its initial pleading alleges that a price squeeze will occur as a direct result of the public utility's request for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), makes a showing that it is likely to incur harm if such CWIP is allowed subject to refund, and makes a showing of how the harm to the intervenor would be mitigated or eliminated by the types of preliminary relief requested, the Commission will consider preliminary relief at the suspension stage of the case pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section. In determining whether to grant preliminary relief, the Commission will balance the following public interest considerations: \n\n(A) The harm to the intervenor if it is not granted preliminary relief from the requested CWIP; \n\n(B) The harm to the public utility if, during the interim period of preliminary relief, the public utility is required to recover its financing charges later through AFUDC rather than immediately through CWIP; and \n\n(C) Mitigating bias against investment in new plants, ensuring accurate price signals, and fostering rate stability. \n\n(ii) Whether or not preliminary relief is granted at the suspension stage will not preclude consideration of further interim or final remedies later in the proceedings, if warranted.\n\n(3) If the Commission makes a final determination that a price squeeze due solely to allowance of a lower percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in the public utility's retail rate base than allowed by this Commission, the Commission will consider an adjustment to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in order to eliminate or mitigate the price squeeze.\n\n(4) If an intervenor meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Commission, depending on the type of showing made including the likelihood, immediacy, and severity of any anticompetitive harm, may:\n\n(i) Suspend the entire rate increase or all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP component for up to five months;\n\n(ii) Allow all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP only prospectively from the issuance of the Commission's final order on rehearing on the matter; or\n\n(iii) Take such other action as is proper under the circumstances.\n\n[Order 474, 52 FR 23965, June 26, 1987, as amended by Order 474-A, 52 FR 35702, Sept. 23, 1987; Order 474-B, 54 FR 32804, Aug. 10, 1989.

          "content": "§ 35.26   Recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities.\n(a) Purpose. This section establishes the standards that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to recover stranded costs.\n\n(b) Definitions. (1) Wholesale stranded cost means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility or a transmitting utility to provide service to:\n\n(i) A wholesale requirements customer that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled wholesale transmission services customer of such public utility or transmitting utility; or\n\n(ii) A retail customer that subsequently becomes, either directly or through another wholesale transmission purchaser, an unbundled wholesale transmission services customer of such public utility or transmitting utility.\n\n(2) Wholesale requirements customer means a customer for whom a public utility or transmitting utility provides by contract any portion of its bundled wholesale power requirements. \n\n(3) Wholesale transmission services means the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, at wholesale in interstate commerce or ordered pursuant to section 211 of the Federal Power Act (FPA).\n\n(4) Wholesale requirements contract means a contract under which a public utility or transmitting utility provides any portion of a customer's bundled wholesale power requirements.\n\n(5) Retail stranded cost means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility to provide service to a retail customer that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled retail transmission services customer of that public utility.\n\n(6) Retail transmission services means the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, in interstate commerce directly to a retail customer.\n\n(7) New wholesale requirements contract means any wholesale requirements contract executed after July 11, 1994, or extended or renegotiated to be effective after July 11, 1994.\n\n(8) Existing wholesale requirements contract means any wholesale requirements contract executed on or before July 11, 1994.\n\n(c) Recovery of wholesale stranded costs—(1) General requirement. A public utility or transmitting utility will be allowed to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs only as follows:\n\n(i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff.\n\n(ii) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated with a new wholesale requirements contract if such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision.\n\n(iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections 205-206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for FPA section 205 or 211 transmission services.\n\n(iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs.\n\n(v) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the public utility may seek recovery of stranded costs only as follows:\n\n(A) If either party to the contract seeks a stranded cost amendment pursuant to a section 205 or section 206 filing under the FPA made prior to the expiration of the contract, and the Commission accepts or approves an amendment permitting recovery of stranded costs, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 rates for electric energy.\n\n(B) If the contract is not amended to permit recovery of stranded costs as described in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the public utility may file a proposal, prior to the expiration of the contract, to recover stranded costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to the customer.\n\n(vi) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs through FPA section 211-212 transmission rates.\n\n(vii) If a retail customer becomes a legitimate wholesale transmission customer of a public utility or transmitting utility, e.g., through municipalization, and costs are stranded as a result of the retail-turned-wholesale customer's access to wholesale transmission, the utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to that customer.\n\n(2) Evidentiary demonstration for wholesale stranded cost recovery. A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover wholesale stranded costs in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) (v) through (vii) of this section must demonstrate that:\n\n(i) It incurred costs to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer or retail customer based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer;\n\n(ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility, or, in the case of a retail-turned-wholesale customer, had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility; and\n\n(iii) The stranded costs are derived using the following formula: Stranded Cost Obligation = (Revenue Stream Estimate—Competitive Market Value Estimate) × Length of Obligation (reasonable expectation period).\n\n(3) Rebuttable presumption. If a public utility or transmitting utility seeks recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, as permitted in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the existing wholesale requirements contract contains a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the term of the notice provision.\n\n(4) Procedure for customer to obtain stranded cost estimate. A customer under an existing wholesale requirements contract with a public utility seller may obtain from the seller an estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation if it were to leave the public utility's generation supply system by filing with the public utility a request for an estimate at any time prior to the termination date specified in its contract.\n\n(i) The public utility must provide a response within 30 days of receiving the request. The response must include:\n\n(A) An estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation based on the formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section;\n\n(B) Supporting detail indicating how each element in the formula was derived;\n\n(C) A detailed rationale justifying the basis for the utility's reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the termination date in the contract;\n\n(D) An estimate of the amount of released capacity and associated energy that would result from the customer's departure; and\n\n(E) The utility's proposal for any contract amendment needed to implement the customer's payment of stranded costs.\n\n(ii) If the customer disagrees with the utility's response, it must respond to the utility within 30 days explaining why it disagrees. If the parties cannot work out a mutually agreeable resolution, they may exercise their rights to Commission resolution under the FPA.\n\n(5) A customer must be given the option to market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with any stranded costs claimed by the public utility.\n\n(i) To exercise the option, the customer must so notify the utility in writing no later than 30 days after the public utility files its estimate of stranded costs for the customer with the Commission.\n\n(A) Before marketing or brokering can begin, the utility and customer must execute an agreement identifying, at a minimum, the amount and the price of capacity and associated energy the customer is entitled to schedule, and the duration of the customer's marketing or brokering of such capacity and energy.\n\n(ii) If agreement over marketing or brokering cannot be reached, and the parties seek Commission resolution of disputed issues, upon issuance of a Commission order resolving the disputed issues, the customer may reevaluate its decision in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to exercise the marketing or brokering option. The customer must notify the utility in writing within 30 days of issuance of the Commission's order resolving the disputed issues whether the customer will market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with stranded costs allowed by the Commission.\n\n(iii) If a customer undertakes the brokering option, and the customer's brokering efforts fail to produce a buyer within 60 days of the date of the brokering agreement entered into between the customer and the utility, the customer shall relinquish all rights to broker the released capacity and associated energy and will pay stranded costs as determined by the formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.\n\n(d) Recovery of retail stranded costs—(1) General requirement. A public utility may seek to recover retail stranded costs through rates for retail transmission services only if the state regulatory authority does not have authority under state law to address stranded costs at the time the retail wheeling is required.\n\n(2) Evidentiary demonstration necessary for retail stranded cost recovery. A public utility seeking to recover retail stranded costs in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section must demonstrate that:\n\n(i) It incurred costs to provide service to a retail customer that obtains retail wheeling based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer; and\n\n(ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility.\n\n[Order 888-A, 62 FR 12460, Mar. 14, 1997]",

Such tariff must be the pro forma tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, or such other tariff as may be approved by the Commission consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(i) Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iii), (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(1)(v) of this section, the open access transmission tariff, which tariff must be the pro forma tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff, and accompanying rates must be filed no later than 60 days prior to the date on which a public utility would engage in a sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce or in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.\n\n(ii) If a public utility owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, it must file the revisions to its open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff, pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(iii) If a public utility owns, controls, or operates transmission facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, such facilities are jointly owned with a non-public utility, and the joint ownership contract prohibits transmission service over the facilities to third parties, the public utility with respect to access over the public utility's share of the jointly owned facilities must file the revisions to its open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(iv) Any public utility whose transmission facilities are under the independent control of a Commission-approved ISO or RTO may satisfy its obligation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, with respect to such facilities, through the open access transmission tariff filed by the ISO or RTO.\n\n(v) If a public utility obtains a waiver of the tariff requirement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, it does not need to file the open access transmission tariff required by this section.\n\n(vi) Any public utility that seeks a deviation from the pro forma tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, must demonstrate that the deviation is consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(vii) Each public utility's open access transmission tariff must include the standards incorporated by reference in part 38 of this chapter.\n\n(2) Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(3)(iii) of this section, every public utility that owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, and that uses those facilities to engage in wholesale sales and/or purchases of electric energy, or unbundled retail sales of electric energy, must take transmission service for such sales and/or purchases under the open access transmission tariff filed pursuant to this section.\n\n(i) For sales of electric energy pursuant to a requirements service agreement executed on or before July 9, 1996, this requirement will not apply unless separately ordered by the Commission. For sales of electric energy pursuant to a bilateral economy energy coordination agreement executed on or before July 9, 1996, this requirement is effective on December 31, 1996. For sales of electric energy pursuant to a bilateral non-economy energy coordination agreement executed on or before July 9, 1996, this requirement will not apply unless separately ordered by the Commission.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(3) Every public utility that owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, and that is a member of a power pool, public utility holding company, or other multi-lateral trading arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions, must have on file a joint pool-wide or system-wide open access transmission tariff, which tariff must be the pro forma tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, or such other open access transmission tariff as may be approved by the Commission consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(i) For any power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed after October 11, 2011, this requirement is effective on the date that transactions begin under the arrangement or agreement.\n\n(ii) For any power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed on or before May 14, 2007, a public utility member of such power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce must file the revisions to its joint pool-wide or system-wide open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(iii) A public utility member of a power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed on or before July 9, 1996 must take transmission service under a joint pool-wide or system-wide open access transmission tariff filed pursuant to this section for wholesale trades among the pool or system members.\n\n(4) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, every Commission-approved ISO or RTO must have on file with the Commission an open access transmission tariff of general applicability for transmission services, including ancillary services, over such facilities. Such tariff must be the pro forma tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, or such other tariff as may be approved by the Commission consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(i) Subject to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a Commission-approved ISO or RTO must file the revisions to its open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(ii) If a Commission-approved ISO or RTO can demonstrate that its existing open access transmission tariff is consistent with or superior to the pro forma tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, the Commission-approved ISO or RTO may instead set forth such demonstration in its filing pursuant to section 206 in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(5) Any public utility that owns transmission facilities that are not under the public utility's control must, consistent with the pro forma tariff required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, share with the public utility that controls such facilities (and its Market Monitoring Unit(s), if applicable):\n\n(i) Transmission line ratings for each period for which transmission line ratings are calculated for such facilities (with updated ratings shared each time ratings are calculated); and\n\n(ii) Written transmission line rating methodologies used to calculate the transmission line ratings for such facilities provided under subparagraph (i).\n\n(d) Waivers. (1) A public utility subject to the requirements of this section and 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) may file a request for waiver of all or part of such requirements for good cause shown. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an application for waiver must be filed no later than 60 days prior to the time the public utility would have to comply with the requirement.\n\n(2) The requirements of this section, 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) are waived for any public utility that is or becomes subject to such requirements solely because it owns, controls, or operates Interconnection Customer's Interconnection Facilities, in whole or in part, as that term is defined in the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, or comparable jurisdictional interconnection facilities that are the subject of interconnection agreements other than the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, if the entity that owns, operates, or controls such facilities either sells electric energy, or files a statement with the Commission that it commits to comply with and be bound by the obligations and procedures applicable to electric utilities under section 210 of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(i) The waivers referenced in this paragraph (d)(2) shall be deemed to be revoked as of the date the public utility ceases to satisfy the qualifications of this paragraph (d)(2), and may be revoked by the Commission if the Commission determines that it is in the public interest to do so. After revocation of its waivers, the public utility must comply with the requirements that had been waived within 60 days of revocation.\n\n(ii) Any eligible entity that seeks interconnection or transmission services with respect to the interconnection facilities for which a waiver is in effect pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2) may follow the procedures in sections 210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act, 18 CFR 2.20, and 18 CFR part 36. In any proceeding pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii):\n\n(A) The Commission will consider it to be in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2) to use capacity thereon when such owner and/or operator can demonstrate that it has specific plans with milestones to use such capacity to interconnect its or its affiliate's future generation projects.\n\n(B) For the first five years after the commercial operation date of the interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2), the Commission will apply the rebuttable presumption that the owner and/or operator of such facilities has definitive plans to use the capacity thereon, and it is thus in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of such facilities to use capacity thereon.\n\n(e) Non-public utility procedures for tariff reciprocity compliance. (1) A non-public utility may submit an open access transmission tariff and a request for declaratory order that its voluntary transmission tariff meets the requirements of Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the pro forma tariff.\n\n(i) Any submittal and request for declaratory order submitted by a non-public utility will be provided an NJ (non-jurisdictional) docket designation.\n\n(ii) If the submittal is found to be an acceptable open access transmission tariff, an applicant in a Federal Power Act (FPA) section 211 or 211A proceeding against the non-public utility shall have the burden of proof to show why service under the open access transmission tariff is not sufficient and why a section 211 or 211A order should be granted.\n\n(2) A non-public utility may file a request for waiver of all or part of the reciprocity conditions contained in a public utility open access transmission tariff, for good cause shown. An application for waiver may be filed at any time.\n\n(f) Standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements. (1) Every public utility that is required to have on file a non-discriminatory open access transmission tariff under this section must amend such tariff by adding the standard interconnection procedures and agreement and the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements, or such other interconnection procedures and agreements as may be required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the standard interconnection procedures and agreement and the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement.\n\n(i) Any public utility that seeks a deviation from the standard interconnection procedures and agreement or the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements, must demonstrate that the deviation is consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements.\n\n(ii) Any public utility that conducts interconnection studies shall be liable for and eligible to appeal certain penalties under the interconnection procedures and agreements adopted by the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization under paragraph (f)(1) of this section following that public utility's failure to complete an interconnection study by the appropriate deadline.\n\n(iii)-(iv) [Reserved] \n\n(2) The non-public utility procedures for tariff reciprocity compliance described in paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to the standard interconnection procedures and agreements.\n\n(3) A public utility subject to the requirements of this paragraph (f) may file a request for waiver of all or part of the requirements of this paragraph (f), for good cause shown.\n\n(g) Tariffs and operations of Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations—(1) Demand response and pricing—(i) Ancillary services provided by demand response resources. (A) Every Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that operates organized markets based on competitive bidding for energy imbalance, spinning reserves,supplemental reserves, reactive power and voltage control, or regulation and frequency response ancillary services (or its functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's tariff) must accept bids from demand response resources in these markets for that product on a basis comparable to any other resources, if the demand response resource meets the necessary technical requirements under the tariff, and submits a bid under the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's bidding rules at or below the market-clearing price, unless not permitted by the laws or regulations of the relevant electric retail regulatory authority.\n\n(B) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must allow providers of a demand response resource to specify the following in their bids:\n\n(1) A maximum duration in hours that the demand response resource may be dispatched;\n\n(2) A maximum number of times that the demand response resource may be dispatched during a day; and\n\n(3) A maximum amount of electric energy reduction that the demand response resource may be required to provide either daily or weekly.\n\n(ii) Removal of deviation charges. A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization with a tariff that contains a day-ahead and a real-time market may not assess charge to a purchaser of electric energy in its day-ahead market for purchasing less power in the real-time market during a real-time market period for which the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization declares an operating reserve shortage or makes a generic request to reduce load to avoid an operating reserve shortage.\n\n(iii) Aggregation of retail customers. Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, and the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority prohibits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers, or the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers.\n\n(iv) Price formation during periods of operating reserve shortage. (A) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must modify its market rules to allow the market-clearing price during periods of operating reserve shortage to reach a level that rebalances supply and demand so as to maintain reliability while providing sufficient provisions for mitigating market power. Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must trigger shortage pricing for any interval in which a shortage of energy or operating reserves is indicated during the pricing of resources for that interval.\n\n(B) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may phase in this modification of its market rules.\n\n(v) Demand response compensation in energy markets. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has a tariff provision permitting demand response resources to participate as a resource in the energy market by reducing consumption of electric energy from their expected levels in response to price signals must:\n\n(A) Pay to those demand response resources the market price for energy for these reductions when these demand response resources have the capability to balance supply and demand and when payment of the market price for energy to these resources is cost-effective as determined by a net benefits test accepted by the Commission;\n\n(B) Allocate the costs associated with demand response compensation proportionally to all entities that purchase from the relevant energy market in the area(s) where the demand response reduces the market price for energy at the time when the demand response resource is committed or dispatched.\n\n(vi) Settlement intervals. Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must settle energy transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it dispatches energy, must settle operating reserves transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it prices operating reserves, and must settle intertie transactions at the same time interval it schedules intertie transactions.\n\n(2) Long-term power contracting in organized markets. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must provide a portion of its Web site for market participants to post offers to buy or sell power on a long-term basis.\n\n(3) Market monitoring policies. (i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must modify its tariff provisions governing its Market Monitoring Unit to reflect the directives provided in Order No. 719, including the following:\n\n(A) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include in its tariff a provision to provide its Market Monitoring Unit access to Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization market data, resources and personnel to enable the MarketMonitoring Unit to carry out its functions.\n\n(B) The tariff provision must provide the Market Monitoring Unit complete access to the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's databases of market information.\n\n(C) The tariff provision must provide that any data created by the Market Monitoring Unit, including, but not limited to, reconfiguring of the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's data, will be kept within the exclusive control of the Market Monitoring Unit.\n\n(D) The Market Monitoring Unit must report to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors, with its management members removed, or to an independent committee of the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors. A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has both an internal Market Monitoring Unit and an external Market Monitoring Unit may permit the internal Market Monitoring Unit to report to management and the external Market Monitoring Unit to report to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors with its management members removed, or to an independent committee of the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization board of directors. If the internal market monitor is responsible for carrying out any or all of the core Market Monitoring Unit functions identified in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, the internal market monitor must report to the independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors.\n\n(E) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may not alter the reports generated by the Market Monitoring Unit, or dictate the conclusions reached by the Market Monitoring Unit.\n\n(F) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must consolidate the core Market Monitoring Unit provisions into one section of its tariff. Each independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include a mission statement in the introduction to the Market Monitoring Unit provisions that identifies the Market Monitoring Unit's goals, including the protection of consumers and market participants by the identification and reporting of market design flaws and market power abuses.\n\n(ii) Core Functions of Market Monitoring Unit. The Market Monitoring Unit must perform the following core functions:\n\n(A) Evaluate existing and proposed market rules, tariff provisions and market design elements and recommend proposed rule and tariff changes to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization, to the Commission's Office of Energy Market Regulation staff and to other interested entities such as state commissions and market participants, provided that:\n\n(1) The Market Monitoring Unit is not to effectuate its proposed market design itself, and\n\n(2) The Market Monitoring Unit must limit distribution of its identifications and recommendations to the independent system operator or regional transmission organization and to Commission staff in the event it believes broader dissemination could lead to exploitation, with an explanation of why further dissemination should be avoided at that time.\n\n(B) Review and report on the performance of the wholesale markets to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization, the Commission, and other interested entities such as state commissions and market participants, on at least a quarterly basis and submit a more comprehensive annual state of the market report. The Market Monitoring Unit may issue additional reports as necessary.\n\n(C) Identify and notify the Commission's Office of Enforcement staff of instances in which a market participant's or the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's behavior may require investigation, including, but not limited to, suspected Market Violations.\n\n(iii) Tariff administration and mitigation (A) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may not permit its Market Monitoring Unit, whether internal or external, to participate in the administration of the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's tariff or, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section, to conduct prospective mitigation.\n\n(B) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may permit its Market Monitoring Unit to provide the inputs required for the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization to conduct prospective mitigation, including, but not limited to, reference levels, identification of system constraints, and cost calculations.\n\n(C) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may allow its Market Monitoring Unit to conduct retrospective mitigation.\n\n(D) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization with a hybrid Market Monitoring Unit structure may permit its internal market monitor to conduct prospective and/or retrospective mitigation, in which case it must assign to its external market monitor the responsibility and the tools to monitor the quality and appropriateness of the mitigation.\n\n(E) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must identify in its tariff the functions the Market Monitoring Unit will perform and the functions the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization will perform.\n\n(iv) Protocols on Market Monitoring Unit referrals to the Commission of suspected violations. (A) A Market Monitoring Unit is to make a non-public referral to the Commission in all instances where the Market Monitoring Unit has reason to believe that a Market Violation has occurred. While the Market Monitoring Unit need not be able to prove that a Market Violation has occurred, the Market Monitoring Unit is to provide sufficient credible information to warrant further investigation by the Commission. Once the Market Monitoring Unit has obtained sufficient credible information to warrant referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to immediately refer the matter to the Commission and desist from independent action related to the alleged Market Violation. This does not preclude the Market Monitoring Unit from continuing to monitor for any repeated instances of the activity by the same or other entities, which would constitute new Market Violations. The Market Monitoring Unit is to respond to requests from the Commission for any additional information in connection with the alleged Market Violation it has referred.\n\n(B) All referrals to the Commission of alleged Market Violations are to be in writing, whether transmitted electronically, by fax, mail, or courier. The Market Monitoring Unit may alert the Commission orally in advance of the written referral.\n\n(C) The referral is to be addressed to the Commission's Director of the Office of Enforcement, with a copy also directed to both the Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation and the General Counsel.\n\n(D) The referral is to include, but need not be limited to, the following information.\n\n(1) The name[s] of and, if possible, the contact information for, the entity[ies] that allegedly took the action[s] that constituted the alleged Market Violation[s];\n\n(2) The date[s] or time period during which the alleged Market Violation[s] occurred and whether the alleged wrongful conduct is ongoing;\n\n(3) The specific rule or regulation, and/or tariff provision, that was allegedly violated, or the nature of any inappropriate dispatch that may have occurred;\n\n(4) The specific act[s] or conduct that allegedly constituted the Market Violation;\n\n(5) The consequences to the market resulting from the acts or conduct, including, if known, an estimate of economic impact on the market;\n\n(6) If the Market Monitoring Unit believes that the act[s] or conduct constituted a violation of the anti-manipulation rule of Part 1c, a description of the alleged manipulative effect on market prices, market conditions, or market rules;\n\n(7) Any other information the Market Monitoring Unit believes is relevant and may be helpful to the Commission.\n\n(E) Following a referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to continue to notify and inform the Commission of any information that the Market Monitoring Unit learns of that may be related to the referral, but the Market Monitoring Unit is not to undertake any investigative steps regarding the referral except at the express direction of the Commission or Commission Staff.\n\n(v) Protocols on Market Monitoring Unit Referrals to the Commission of Perceived Market Design Flaws and Recommended Tariff Changes. (A) A Market Monitoring Unit is to make a referral to the Commission in all instances where the Market Monitoring Unit has reason to believe market design flaws exist that it believes could effectively be remedied by rule or tariff changes. The Market Monitoring Unit must limit distribution of its identifications and recommendations to the independent system operator or regional transmission organization and to the Commission in the event it believes broader dissemination could lead to exploitation, with an explanation of why further dissemination should be avoided at that time.\n\n(B) All referrals to the Commission relating to perceived market design flaws and recommended tariff changes are to be in writing, whether transmitted electronically, by fax, mail, or courier. The Market Monitoring Unit may alert the Commission orally in advance of the written referral.\n\n(C) The referral should be addressed to the Commission's Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation, with copies directed to both the Director of the Office of Enforcement and the General Counsel.\n\n(D) The referral is to include, but need not be limited to, the following information.\n\n(1) A detailed narrative describing the perceived market design flaw[s];\n\n(2) The consequences of the perceived market design flaw[s], including, if known, an estimate of economic impact on the market;\n\n(3) The rule or tariff change(s) that the Market Monitoring Unit believes could remedy the perceived market design flaw;\n\n(4) Any other information the Market Monitoring Unit believes is relevant and may be helpful to the Commission.\n\n(E) Following a referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to continue to notify and inform the Commission of any additional information regarding the perceived market design flaw, its effects on the market, any additional or modified observations concerning the rule or tariff changes that could remedy the perceived design flaw, any recommendations made by the Market Monitoring Unit to the regional transmission organization or independent system operator, stakeholders, market participants or state commissions regarding the perceived design flaw, and any actions taken by the regional transmission organization or independent system operator regarding the perceived design flaw.\n\n(vi) Market Monitoring Unit ethics standards. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include in its tariff ethical standards for its Market Monitoring Unit and the employees of its Market Monitoring Unit. At a minimum, the ethics standards must include the following requirements:\n\n(A) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must have no material affiliation with any market participant or affiliate.\n\n(B) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not serve as an officer, employee, or partner of a market participant.\n\n(C) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must have no material financial interest in any market participant or affiliate with potential exceptions for mutual funds and non-directed investments.\n\n(D) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not engage in any market transactions other than the performance of their duties under the tariff.\n\n(E) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not be compensated, other than by the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that retains or employs it, for any expert witness testimony or other commercial services, either to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization or to any other party, in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding or commercial transaction relating to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization or to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's markets.\n\n(F) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees may not accept anything of value from a market participant in excess of a de minimis amount.\n\n(G) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must advise a supervisor in the event they seek employment with a market participant, and must disqualify themselves from participating in any matter that would have an effect on the financial interest of the market participant.\n\n(4) Electronic delivery of data. Each Commission-approved regional transmission organization and independent system operator must electronically deliver to the Commission, on an ongoing basis and in a form and manner consistent with its own collection of data and in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, data related to the markets that the regional transmission organization or independent system operator administers.\n\n(5) Offer and bid data. (i) Unless a Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization obtains Commission approval for a different period, each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must release its offer and bid data within three months.\n\n(ii) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must mask the identity of market participants when releasing offer and bid data. The Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organization may propose a time period for eventual unmasking.\n\n(6) Responsiveness of Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations.

The business practices and procedures must provide for stakeholder input into the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's decisions as well as mechanisms to provide feedback to stakeholders to ensure that information exchange and communication continue over time.\n\n(7) Compliance filings. All Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations must make a compliance filing with the Commission as described in Order No. 719 under the following schedule:\n\n(i) The compliance filing addressing the accepting of bids from demand response resources in markets for ancillary services on a basis comparable to other resources, removal of deviation charges, aggregation of retail customers, shortage pricing during periods of operating reserve shortage, long-term power contracting in organized markets, Market Monitoring Units, Commission-approved independent system operators' and regional transmission organizations' board of directors' responsiveness, and reporting on the study of the need for further reforms to remove barriers to comparable treatment of demand response resources must be submitted on or before April 28, 2009.\n\n(ii) A public utility that is approved as a regional transmission organization under § 35.34, or that is not approved but begins to operate regional markets for electric energy or ancillary services after December 29, 2008, must comply with Order No. 719 and the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section before beginning operations.\n\n(8) Frequency regulation compensation in ancillary services markets. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has a tariff that provides for the compensation for frequency regulation service must provide such compensation based on the actual service provided, including a capacity payment that includes the marginal unit's opportunity costs and a payment for performance that reflects the quantity of frequency regulation service provided by a resource when the resource is accurately following the dispatch signal.\n\n(9) Electric storage resources. (i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions providing a participation model for electric storage resources that:\n\n(A) Ensures that a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources in an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market is eligible to provide all capacity, energy, and ancillary services that it is technically capable of providing;\n\n(B) Enables a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources to be dispatched and ensures that such a dispatchable resource can set the wholesale market clearing price as both a wholesale seller and wholesale buyer consistent with rules that govern the conditions under which a resource can set the wholesale price;\n\n(C) Accounts for the physical and operational characteristics of electric storage resources through bidding parameters or other means; and\n\n(D) Establishes a minimum size requirement for resources using the participation model for electric storage resources that does not exceed 100 kW.\n\n(ii) The sale of electric energy from an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market to an electric storage resource that the resource then resells back to that market must be at the wholesale locational marginal price.\n\n(10) Transparency—(i) Uplift reporting. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post two reports, at minimum, regarding uplift on a publicly accessible portion of its website. First, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post uplift, paid in dollars, and categorized by transmission zone, day, and uplift category. Transmission zone shall be defined as the geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Transmission zones with fewer than four resources may be aggregated with one or more neighboring transmission zones, until each aggregated zone contains at least four resources, and reported collectively. This report shall be posted within 20 calendar days of the end of each month. Second, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post the resource name and the total amount of uplift paid in dollars aggregated across the month to each resource that received uplift payments within the calendar month. This report shall be posted within 90 calendar days of the end of each month.\n\n(ii) Reporting Operator-Initiated Commitments. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post a report of each operator-initiated commitment listing the size of the commitment, transmission zone, commitment reason, and commitment start time on a publicly accessible portion of its website within 30 calendar days of the end of each month. Transmission zone shall be defined as a geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Commitment reasons shall include, but are not limited to, system-wide capacity, constraint management, and voltage support.\n\n(iii) Transmission constraint penalty factors. Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include, in its tariff, its transmission constraint penalty factor values; the circumstances, if any, under which the transmission constraint penalty factors can set locational marginal prices; and the procedure, if any, for temporarily changing the transmission constraint penalty factor values. Any procedure for temporarily changing transmission constraint penalty factor values must provide for notice of the change to market participants.\n\n(11) A resource's incremental energy offer must be capped at the higher of $1,000/MWh or that resource's cost-based incremental energy offer. For the purpose of calculating Locational Marginal Prices, Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators must cap cost-based incremental energy offers at $2,000/MWh. The actual or expected costs underlying a resource's cost-based incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh must be verified before that offer can be used for purposes of calculating Locational Marginal Prices. If a resource submits an incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh and the actual or expected costs underlying that offer cannot be verified before the market clearing process begins, that offer may not be used to calculate Locational Marginal Prices and the resource would be eligible for a make-whole payment if that resource is dispatched and the resource's actual costs are verified after-the-fact. A resource would also be eligible for a make-whole payment if it is dispatched and its verified cost-based incremental energy offer exceeds $2,000/MWh. All resources, regardless of type, are eligible to submit cost-based incremental energy offers in excess of $1,000/MWh.\n\n(12) Distributed energy resource aggregators. (i) Each independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions that allow distributed energy resource aggregations to participate directly in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets.\n\n(ii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator, to accommodate the participation of distributed energy resource aggregations, must establish market rules that address:\n\n(A) Eligibility to participate in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets through a distributed energy resource aggregation;\n\n(B) Locational requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;\n\n(C) Distribution factors and bidding parameters for distributed energy resource aggregations;\n\n(D) Information and data requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;\n\n(E) Modification to the list of resources in a distributed energy resource aggregation;\n\n(F) Metering and telemetry system requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;\n\n(G) Coordination between the regional transmission organization or independent system operator, the distributed energy resource aggregator, the distribution utility, and the relevant electric retail regulatory authorities; and\n\n(H) Market participation agreements for distributed energy resource aggregators.\n\n(iii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must establish a minimum size requirement for distributed energy resource aggregations that does not exceed 100 kW.\n\n(iv) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers to be bid into RTO/ISO markets by a distributed energy resource aggregator.\n\n(13) Transmission line ratings. (i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must establish and maintain systems and procedures necessary to allow any public utility whose transmission facilities are under the independent control of the independent system operator or regional transmission organization to electronically update transmission line ratings for such facilities (for each period for which transmission line ratings are calculated) at least hourly, with such data submitted by those public utility transmission owners directly into the independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's EMS through SCADA or related systems.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n[Order 888, 61 FR 21693, May 10, 1996]\n\n\nEditorial Note:For Federal Register citations affecting § 35.28, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.govinfo.gov.",

This subpart applies to any sales of electric power subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Part II of the Federal Power Act from public utilities to the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) at the average system cost (ASC) of that utility's resources (electric power generation by the utility) pursuant to section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 830-839h. The ASC is determined by BPA in accordance with 18 CFR part 301.\n\n(b) Effectiveness of rates. (1) During the period between the date of BPA's determination of ASC and the date of the final order issued by the Commission, the utility may charge the rate based on the ASC determined by BPA, subject to § 35.31(c) of this part.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the ASC ordered by the Commission will be deemed in effect from the beginning of the relevant exchange period, as defined in § 301.1(b)(95) of this chapter. For any initial exchange period after the Commission approves a new ASC methodology, the ASC will be effective retroactively under this paragraph only if the utility files its new ASC within the time allowed under BPA procedures. Any utility that files a revised ASC with BPA in accordance with this paragraph must promptly file with the Commission a notice of timely filing of the new ASC.\n\n(c) Filing requirements. Within 15 business days of the date of issuance of the BPA report on a utility's ASC, the utility must file with the Commission the ASC determined by BPA, the BPA written report, the utility's ASC schedules, material necessary to comply with 18 CFR 35.13(c), and any other material requested by the Commission or its staff.\n\n[Order 337, 48 FR 46976, Oct. 17, 1983, as amended by Order 400, 49 FR 39300, Oct. 5, 1984]",

In calculating the $100 million net worth requirement, the net worth of the Trustee's parent corporation and/or affiliates may be taken into account only if such entities guarantee the Trustee's responsibilities to the Fund.\n\n(5) The Trustee or Investment Manager shall keep accurate and detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements and transactions of the Fund. All accounts, books and records relating to the Fund shall be open to inspection and audit at reasonable times by the utility or its designee or by the Commission or its designee. The utility or its designee must notify the Commission prior to performing any such inspection or audit. The Commission may direct the utility to conduct an audit or inspection.\n\n(6) Absent the express authorization of the Commission, no part of the assets of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than to fund the costs of decommissioning the nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates, and to pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses, including taxes, of the Fund.\n\n(7) If the Fund balances exceed the amount actually expended for decommissioning after decommissioning has been completed, the utility shall return the excess jurisdictional amount to ratepayers, in a manner the Commission determines.\n\n(8) Except for investments tied to market indexes or other mutual funds, the Investment Manager shall not invest in any securities of the utility for which it manages the funds or in that utility's subsidiaries, affiliates, or associates or their successors or assigns.\n\n(9) The utility and the Fiduciary shall seek to obtain the best possible tax treatment of amounts collected for nuclear plant decommissioning. In this regard, the utility and the Fiduciary shall take maximum advantage of tax deductions and credits, when it is consistent with sound business practices to do so.\n\n(10) Each utility shall deposit in the Fund at least quarterly all amounts included in Commission-jurisdictional rates to fund nuclear power plant decommissioning.\n\n(b) The establishment, organization, and maintenance of the Fund shall not relieve the utility or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates of any obligations it may have as to the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant. It is not the responsibility of the Fiduciary to ensure that the amount of monies that a Fund contains are adequate to pay for a nuclear unit's decommissioning.\n\n(c) A utility may establish both qualified and non-qualified Funds with respect to a utility's interest in a specific nuclear plant. This section applies to both “qualified” (under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 468A, or any successor section) and non-qualified Funds.\n\n(d) A utility must regularly supply to the Fund's Investment Manager, and regularly update, essential information about the nuclear unit covered by the Trust Fund Agreement, including its description, location, expected remaining useful life, the decommissioning plan the utility proposes to follow, the utility's liquidity needs once decommissioning begins, and any other information that the Fund's Investment Manager would need to construct and maintain, over time, a sound investment plan.\n\n(e) A utility should monitor the performance of all Fiduciaries of the Fund and, if necessary, replace them if they are not properly performing assigned responsibilities.\n\n[Order 580-A, 62 FR 33348, June 19, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004]",

          "content": "§ 35.35   Transmission infrastructure investment.\n(a) Purpose. This section establishes rules for incentive-based (including performance-based) rate treatments for transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce by public utilities for the purpose of benefiting consumers by ensuring reliability and reducing the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion.\n\n(b) Definitions. (1) Transco means a stand-alone transmission company that has been approved by the Commission and that sells transmission services at wholesale and/or on an unbundled retail basis, regardless of whether it is affiliated with another public utility.\n\n(2) Transmission Organization means a Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, independent transmission provider, or other transmission organization finally approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.\n\n(c) General rule. All rates approved under the rules of this section, including any revisions to the rules, are subject to the filing requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act and to the substantive requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act that all rates, charges, terms and conditions be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\n\n(d) Incentive-based rate treatments for transmission infrastructure investment. The Commission will authorize any incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (d), for transmission infrastructure investment, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. A public utility's request for one or more incentive-based rate treatments, to be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205, must include a detailed explanation of how the proposed rate treatment complies with the requirements of section 219 of the Federal Power Act and a demonstration that the proposed rate treatment is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The applicant must demonstrate that the facilities for which it seeks incentives either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion consistent with the requirements of section 219, that the total package of incentives is tailored to address the demonstrable risks or challenges faced by the applicant in undertaking the project, and that resulting rates are just and reasonable. For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:\n\n(1) For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:\n\n(i) A rate of return on equity sufficient to attract new investment in transmission facilities;\n\n(ii) 100 percent of prudently incurred Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) in rate base;\n\n(iii) Recovery of prudently incurred pre-commercial operations costs;\n\n(iv) Hypothetical capital structure;\n\n(v) Accelerated depreciation used for rate recovery;\n\n(vi) Recovery of 100 percent of prudently incurred costs of transmission facilities that are cancelled or abandoned due to factors beyond the control of the public utility;\n\n(vii) Deferred cost recovery; and\n\n(viii) Any other incentives approved by the Commission, pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph, that are determined to be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\n\n(2) In addition to the incentives in § 35.35(d)(1), the Commission will authorize the following incentive-based rate treatments for Transcos, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential:\n\n(i) A return on equity that both encourages Transco formation and is sufficient to attract investment; and\n\n(ii) An adjustment to the book value of transmission assets being sold to a Transco to remove the disincentive associated with the impact of accelerated depreciation on federal capital gains tax liabilities.\n\n(e) Incentives for joining a Transmission Organization. The Commission will authorize an incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (e), for public utilities that join a Transmission Organization, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Applicants for the incentive-based rate treatment must make a filing with the Commission under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an incentive-based rate treatment means a return on equity that is higher than the return on equity the Commission might otherwise allow if the public utility did not join a Transmission Organization. The Commission will also permit transmitting utilities or electric utilities that join a Transmission Organization the ability to recover prudently incurred costs associated with joining the Transmission Organization, either through transmission rates charged by transmitting utilities or electric utilities or through transmission rates charged by the Transmission Organization that provides services to such utilities.\n\n(f) Approval of prudently-incurred costs. The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs necessary to comply with the mandatory reliability standards pursuant to section 215 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\n\n(g) Approval of prudently incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development. The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\n\n(h) FERC-730, Report of transmission investment activity. Public utilities that have been granted incentive rate treatment for specific transmission projects must file FERC-730 on an annual basis beginning with the calendar year incentive rate treatment is granted by the Commission. Such filings are due by April 18 of the following calendar year and are due April 18 each year thereafter. The following information must be filed:\n\n(1) In dollar terms, actual transmission investment for the most recent calendar year, and projected, incremental investments for the next five calendar years;\n\n(2) For all current and projected investments over the next five calendar years, a project by project listing that specifies for each project the most up-to-date, expected completion date, percentage completion as of the date of filing, and reasons for delays. Exclude from this listing projects with projected costs less than $20 million; and\n\n(3) For good cause shown, the Commission may extend the time within which any FERC-730 filing is to be filed or waive the requirements applicable to any such filing.\n\n(i) Rebuttable presumption. (1) The Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has demonstrated that its project is needed to ensure reliability or reduces the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for:\n\n(i) A transmission project that results from a fair and open regional planning process that considers and evaluates projects for reliability and/or congestion and is found to be acceptable to the Commission; or\n\n(ii) A project that has received construction approval from an appropriate state commission or state siting authority.\n\n(2) To the extent these approval processes do not require that a project ensures reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion, the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that its project satisfies these criteria.\n\n(j) Commission authorization to site electric transmission facilities in interstate commerce. If the Commission pursuant to its authority under section 216 of the Federal Power Act and its regulations thereunder has issued one or more permits for the construction or modification of transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary, such facilities shall be deemed to either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for purposes of section 219(a).\n\n[Order 679, 71 FR 43338, July 31, 2006, as amended by Order 679-A, 72 FR 1172, Jan. 10, 2007, Order 691, 72 FR 5174, Feb. 5, 2007]",

          "content": "§ 35.37   Market power analysis required.\n(a)(1) In addition to other requirements in subparts A and B, a Seller must submit a market power analysis in the following circumstances: When seeking market-based rate authority; for Category 2 Sellers, every three years, according to the schedule posted on the Commission's website; or any other time the Commission directs a Seller to submit one. Failure to timely file an updated market power analysis will constitute a violation of Seller's market-based rate tariff. The market power analysis must be preceded by a submission of information into a relational database that will include a list of the Seller's own assets, the assets of its non-market-based rate affiliate(s) and identification of its ultimate upstream affiliate(s). The relational database submission will also include information necessary to generate the indicative screens, if necessary, as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. When seeking market-based rate authority, the relational database submission must also include other market-based information concerning category status, operating reserves authorization, mitigation, and other limitations.\n\n(2) When submitting a market power analysis, whether as part of an initial application or an update, a Seller must include a description of its ownership structure that identifies all ultimate upstream affiliate(s). With respect to any investors or owners that a Seller represents to be passive, the Seller must affirm in its narrative that the ownership interests consist solely of passive rights that are necessary to protect the passive investors' or owners' investments and do not confer control. The Seller must also include an appendix of assets and, if necessary, indicative screens as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A Seller must include all supporting materials referenced in the indicative screens. The appendix of assets and indicative screens are derived from the information submitted by a Seller and its affiliates into the relational database and retrievable in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.\n\n(b) A market power analysis must address whether a Seller has horizontal and vertical market power.\n\n(c)(1) There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, and primary frequency response service if it passes two indicative market power screens: a pivotal supplier analysis based on annual peak demand of the relevant market, and a market share analysis applied on a seasonal basis. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of operating reserve-spinning and operating reserve-supplemental services if the Seller passes these two indicative market power screens and demonstrates in its market-based rate application how the scheduling practices in its region support the delivery of operating reserve resources from one balancing authority area to another. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller possesses horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, operating reserve-spinning service, operating reserve-supplemental service, and primary frequency response service if it fails either screen.\n\n(2) Sellers and intervenors may also file alternative evidence to support or rebut the results of the indicative screens. Sellers may file such evidence at the time they file their indicative screens. Intervenors may file such evidence in response to a Seller's submissions.\n\n(3) If a Seller does not pass one or both screens, the Seller may rebut a presumption of horizontal market power by submitting a Delivered Price Test analysis. A Seller that does not rebut a presumption of horizontal market power or that concedes market power, is subject to mitigation, as described in § 35.38.\n\n(4) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying regional transmission organization (RTO) or independent system operator (ISO) markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy, ancillary services, and capacity markets may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power Sellers may have in those markets.\n\n(5) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying RTO or ISO markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy and ancillary services markets, but not capacity markets, may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power that Sellers may have in energy and ancillary services. However, Sellers studying such RTOs/ISOs would need to submit indicative market power screens if they wish to obtain market-based rate authority for wholesale sales of capacity in these markets.\n\n(6) Sellers submitting simultaneous transmission import limit studies must file Submittal 1, and, if applicable, Submittal 2, in the electronic spreadsheet format provided on the Commission's Web site.\n\n(d) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power, a Seller that owns, operates or controls transmission facilities, or whose affiliates own, operate or control transmission facilities, must have on file with the Commission an Open Access Transmission Tariff, as described in § 35.28; provided, however, that a Seller whose foreign affiliate(s) own, operate or control transmission facilities outside of the United States that can be used by competitors of the Seller to reach United States markets must demonstrate that such affiliate either has adopted and is implementing an Open Access Transmission Tariff as described in § 35.28, or otherwise offers comparable, non-discriminatory access to such transmission facilities.\n\n(e) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power in wholesale energy markets through the affiliation, ownership or control of inputs to electric power production, such as the transportation or distribution of the inputs to electric power production, a Seller must provide the following information:\n\n(1) A description of its ownership or control of, or affiliation with an entity that owns or controls, intrastate natural gas transportation, intrastate natural gas storage or distribution facilities;\n\n(2) Physical coal supply sources and ownership or control over who may access transportation of coal supplies; and\n\n(3) A Seller must ensure that this information is included in the record of each new application for market-based rates and each updated market power analysis. In addition, a Seller is required to make an affirmative statement that it and its affiliates have not erected barriers to entry into the relevant market and will not erect barriers to entry into the relevant market.\n\n(f) If the Seller seeks to protect any portion of a filing from public disclosure, the Seller must make its filing in accordance with the Commission's instructions for filing privileged materials and critical energy infrastructure information in § 388.112 of this chapter.\n\n[Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, as amended by Order 697-B, 73 FR 79627, Dec. 30, 2008; Order 769, 77 FR 65475, Oct. 29, 2012; Order 784, 78 FR 46209, July 30, 2013; Order 816, 80 FR 67108, Oct. 30, 2015; Order 819, 80 FR 73977, Nov. 27, 2015; Order 861, 84 FR 36386, July 26, 2019; Order 860, 84 FR 36428, July 26, 2019]",

As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the conditions provided in this section, including the restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy and all other affiliate provisions, must be satisfied on an ongoing basis, unless otherwise authorized by Commission rule or order. Failure to satisfy these conditions will constitute a violation of the Seller's market-based rate tariff.\n\n(b) Restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy or capacity. As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, no wholesale sale of electric energy or capacity may be made between a franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate without first receiving Commission authorization for the transaction under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. All authorizations to engage in affiliate wholesale sales of electric energy or capacity must be listed in a Seller's market-based rate tariff.\n\n(c) Separation of functions. (1) For the purpose of this paragraph, entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of a franchised public utility with captive customers (such as entities controlling or marketing power from the electrical generation assets of the franchised public utility) are considered part of the franchised public utility. Entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the market-regulated power sales affiliates of a franchised public utility with captive customers are considered part of the market-regulated power sales affiliates.\n\n(2) (i) To the maximum extent practical, the employees of a market-regulated power sales affiliate must operate separately from the employees of any affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers.\n\n(ii) Franchised public utilities with captive customers are permitted to share support employees, and field and maintenance employees with their market-regulated power sales affiliates. Franchised public utilities with captive customers are also permitted to share senior officers and boards of directors with their market-regulated power sales affiliates; provided, however, that the shared officers and boards of directors must not participate in directing, organizing or executing generation or market functions.\n\n(iii) Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this section, in emergency circumstances affecting system reliability, a market-regulated power sales affiliate and a franchised public utility with captive customers may take steps necessary to keep the bulk power system in operation. A franchised public utility with captive customers or the market-regulated power sales affiliate must report to the Commission and disclose to the public on its Web site, each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the restrictions of section 35.39, within 24 hours of such deviation.\n\n(d) Information sharing. (1) A franchised public utility with captive customers may not share market information with a market-regulated power sales affiliate if the sharing could be used to the detriment of captive customers, unless simultaneously disclosed to the public.\n\n(2) Permissibly shared support employees, field and maintenance employees and senior officers and board of directors under §§ 35.39(c)(2)(ii) may have access to information covered by the prohibition of § 35.39(d)(1), subject to the no-conduit provision in § 35.39(g).\n\n(e) Non-power goods or services. (1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a franchised public utility with captive customers, to a market-regulated power sales affiliate must be at the higher of cost or market price.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a market-regulated power sales affiliate to an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers may not be at a price above market.\n\n(f) Brokering of power. (1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a market-regulated power sales affiliate seeks to broker power for an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers:\n\n(i) The market-regulated power sales affiliate must offer the franchised public utility's power first;\n\n(ii) The arrangement between the market-regulated power sales affiliate and the franchised public utility must be non-exclusive; and\n\n(iii) The market-regulated power sales affiliate may not accept any fees in conjunction with any brokering services it performs for an affiliated franchised public utility.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a franchised public utility with captive customers seeks to broker power for a market-regulated power sales affiliate:\n\n(i) The franchised public utility must charge the higher of its costs for the service or the market price for such services;\n\n(ii) The franchised public utility must market its own power first, and simultaneously make public (on the Internet) any market information shared with its affiliate during the brokering; and\n\n(iii) The franchised public utility must post on the Internet the actual brokering charges imposed.\n\n(g) No conduit provision. A franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate are prohibited from using anyone, including asset managers, as a conduit to circumvent the affiliate restrictions in §§ 35.39(a) through (g).\n\n(h) Franchised utilities without captive customers. If necessary, any affiliate restrictions regarding separation of functions, power sales or non-power goods and services transactions, or brokering involving two or more franchised public utilities, one or more of whom has captive customers and one or more of whom does not have captive customers, will be imposed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n[Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, as amended by Order 697-A, 73 FR 25912, May 7, 2008]",

Pursuant to FPA section 219A(g), Advanced Cybersecurity Technology Information is considered to be Critical Electric Infrastructure Information.\n\nCritical Energy/Electric Infrastructure Information (CEII) has the same meaning as defined in 18 CFR 388.113.\n\nElectric Reliability Organization has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.\n\nReliability Standard has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.\n\n(c) Incentive-based rate treatment for cybersecurity investment. The Commission will authorize incentive-based rate treatment for a utility that voluntarily makes an investment in Advanced Cybersecurity Technology and for a utility that voluntarily participates in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program under this section, provided that the utility meets the requirements of this section and the utility demonstrates that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, as required by sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. Incentive-based rate treatment is available to both public and non-public utilities that have or will have a rate on file with the Commission. A utility may request a single incentive-based rate treatment as specified in paragraph (f) of this section for an eligible cybersecurity investment that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(d) Eligibility criteria. Pursuant to paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, a utility may receive incentive-based rate treatment for a cybersecurity investment that:\n\n(1) Materially improves cybersecurity through either Advanced Cybersecurity Technology or participation in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program; and\n\n(2) Is not already mandated by the Reliability Standards as maintained by the Electric Reliability Organization, or otherwise mandated by local, State, or Federal law, decision, or directive; otherwise legally mandated; or an action taken in response to a Federal or State agency merger condition, consent decree from Federal or State agency, or settlement agreement that resolves a dispute between a utility and a public or private party.\n\n(e) Demonstrating satisfaction of the eligibility criteria. A utility shall demonstrate to the Commission that a proposed cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. Such demonstration shall show that the cybersecurity investment fulfills at least one of the provisions in the following paragraphs (e)(1) through (3):\n\n(1) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment qualifies as one or more of the pre-qualified cybersecurity investments. The Commission shall rebuttably presume that pre-qualified cybersecurity investments satisfy the eligibility criteria. The Commission shall maintain a list on its website of pre-qualified cybersecurity investments and shall update such list from time to time either subject to notice and comment procedures or in a rulemaking.\n\n(2) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment satisfies each of the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria.\n\n(3) A utility shall demonstrate that it will make cybersecurity investments to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria. Any incentives authorized by the Commission pursuant to this section shall terminate when the Reliability Standard takes effect.\n\n(f) Types of incentive-based rate treatment for cybersecurity investment. For purposes of this section, incentive-based rate treatment shall mean deferral of expenses as a regulatory asset.\n\n(g) Incentive duration. (1) A deferred Advanced Cybersecurity Technology regulatory asset whose costs are typically expensed shall be:\n\n(i) Amortized over a period of up to five years;\n\n(ii) Limited to expenses incurred in the first five years following Commission approval of the incentive;\n\n(iii) Limited to ongoing expenses that the applicable utility was not already undertaking more than three months prior to filing an incentive request; and\n\n(iv) Terminated when the cybersecurity investment or activity that serves as the basis of that incentive becomes mandatory.\n\n(2) An incentive granted for participation in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program will not be subject to the five-year duration limitation provisions of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section for as long as the utility participates in the qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program and such participation is not mandatory as to the utility. A utility participating in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program is eligible to continue deferring expenses associated with such participation, which for each year would be amortized over the next five years.\n\n(h) Incentive applications. For the purpose of this section, a utility's request for incentive based-rate treatments for one or more cybersecurity investments must be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Utilities may file such a request either as a part of a general rate request or on a single-issue basis. Such a request shall include a detailed explanation to include the following information:\n\n(1) A demonstration that the cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria, which includes an attestation that cybersecurity investment is not mandatory, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential;\n\n(2) A detailed description of relevant cybersecurity expenses, including whether such cybersecurity expenses are:\n\n(i) Associated with third-party provision of hardware, software, computing networking services, and/or cybersecurity monitoring services;\n\n(ii) For training to implement network analysis and monitoring programs, and/or other cybersecurity protocols; and/or\n\n(iii) Other cybersecurity expenses;\n\n(3) Estimates of the cost of such cybersecurity expenses;\n\n(4) When the cybersecurity expenses are expected to be incurred; and\n\n(5) An attestation that the utility either has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months or that the utility is participating in a cybersecurity threat information-sharing program for the expense at issue. In the case of cybersecurity investments made to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the utility must attest that it has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months prior to the date that the Commission's approval of the Reliability Standard becomes effective.\n\n(i) Reporting requirements. A utility that has received Commission approval for incentive-based rate treatment under this section shall make an annual informational filing on June 1, provided that the utility has received such Commission approval at least 60 days prior to June 1 of that year. A utility that receives Commission approval of an incentive-based rate treatment under this section later than 60 days prior to June 1 shall submit an annual informational filing beginning on June 1 of the following year. The annual filing shall detail the specific cybersecurity investments that were made pursuant to the Commission's approval and the corresponding FERC account used. The annual informational filing shall describe the deferred expenses in sufficient detail to demonstrate that such expenses are specifically related to the cybersecurity investment granted incentives and not for ongoing services including system maintenance, surveillance, and other labor costs. Utilities shall provide a detailed description of any material changes in the nature of such expenses from prior year informational filings.\n\n(j) Transmittal of CEII in incentive applications and annual reports. As appropriate, any CEII submitted to the Commission in a utility's incentive application made pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section or contained in its reporting requirements made pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section shall be filed consistent with part 388 of this title.\n\n[88 FR 28377, May 3, 2023; 88 FR 37145, June 7, 2023]",

This includes a ratemaking method that is part of an approved settlement or arbitration providing that the ratemaking method is to be effective beyond the term of the settlement or arbitration.\n\n(3) Income tax purposes means for the purpose of computing actual income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).\n\n(4) Income tax component means that part of the cost-of-service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.\n\n(5) Ratemaking purposes means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, accepting, approving, disapproving, or rejecting rates under the Natural Gas Act.\n\n(6) Tax effect means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction. \n\n(7) Transaction means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry. \n\n(c) Reduction of, and addition to, Rate Base. (1) The rate base of an interstate pipeline using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property”; Account 282, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other property”: and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base. Include, as an addition or reduction, as appropriate, amounts in Account 182.3, Other regulatory assets, and Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities, that result from a deficiency or excess in the deferred tax accounts (see paragraph (d) of this section) and which have been, or are soon expected to be, authorized for recovery or refund through rates. \n\n(2) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction, or other costs and revenues affecting jurisdictional cost-of-service. \n\n(d) Special rules. (1) This paragraph applies: \n\n(i) If the rate applicant has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization always been applied; or \n\n(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in, or in excess of, amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities. \n\n(2) The interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component in its cost-of-service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes. \n\n(3) The interstate pipeline must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline for determining the cost-of-service provision described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline, then the interstate pipeline must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of such method will be subject to case-by-case determination. \n\n(4) An interstate pipeline must continue to include, as an addition or reduction to rate base, any deficiency or excess attributable to prior flow-through or changes in tax rates (paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section), until such deficiency or excess is fully amortized in accordance with a Commission approved ratemaking method.",

The following must be included in the general terms and conditions: \n\n(1) A statement of the nature of the revenue or costs to be flowed through to the customer; \n\n(2) A statement of the manner in which the cost or revenue will be collected or returned, whether through a surcharge, offset, or otherwise; \n\n(3) A statement of which customers are recipients of the revenue credit and which rate schedules are subject to the cost or fuel reimbursement percentage; \n\n(4) A statement of the frequency of the adjustment and the dates on which the adjustment will become effective; \n\n(5) A step-by-step description of the manner in which the amount to be flowed through is calculated and a step-by-step description of the flowthrough mechanism, including how the costs are classified and allocated. Where the adjustment modifies a rate established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part; \n\n(6) Where costs or revenue credits are accumulated over a past period for periodic recovery or return, the past period must be defined and the mechanism for the recovery or return must be detailed on a step-by-step basis. Where the natural gas company proposes to use a surcharge to clear an account in which the difference between costs or revenues, recovered through rates, and actual costs and revenues accumulate, a statement must be included detailing, on a step-by-step basis, the mechanism for calculating the entries to the account and for passing through the account balance. \n\n(7) Where carrying charges are computed, the calculations must be consistent with the methodology and reporting requirements set forth in § 154.501 using the carrying charge rate required by that section. A natural gas company must normalize all income tax timing differences which are the result of differences between the period in which expense or revenue enters into the determination of taxable income and the period in which the expense or revenue enters into the determination of pre-tax book income. Any balance upon which the natural gas company calculates carrying charges must be adjusted for any recorded deferred income taxes. \n\n(8) Where the natural gas company discounts the rate component calculated pursuant to this section, explain on a step-by-step basis how the natural gas company will adjust for rate discounts in its methodology to reflect changes in costs under this section. \n\n(9) If the costs passed through under a mechanism approved under this section are billed by an upstream natural gas company, explain how refunds received from upstream natural gas companies will be passed through to the natural gas company's customers, including the allocation and classification of such refunds; \n\n(10) A step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to reflect changes in the fuel reimbursement percentage, including the allocation and classification of the fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas. Where the adjustment modifies a fuel reimbursement percentage established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part; \n\n(11) A statement of whether the difference between quantities actually used or lost and the quantities retained from the customers for fuel use and loss will be recovered or returned in a future surcharge. Include a step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to calculate such surcharge. Any period during which these differences accumulate must be defined. \n\n(d) Filing requirements. (1) Filings under this section must include: \n\n(i) A summary statement showing the rate component added to each rate schedule with workpapers showing all mathematical calculations. \n\n(ii) If the filing establishes a new fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge, include computations for each fuel reimbursement or surcharge calculated, broken out by service, classification, area, zone, or other subcategory. \n\n(iii) Workpapers showing the allocation of costs or revenue credits by rate schedule and step-by-step computations supporting the allocation, segregated into reservation and usage amounts, where appropriate. \n\n(iv) Where the costs, revenues, rates, quantities, indices, load factors, percentages, or other numbers used in the calculations are publicly available, include references by source. \n\n(v) Where a rate or quantity underlying the costs or revenue credits is supported by publicly available data (such as another natural gas company's tariff or EBB), the source must be referenced to allow the Commission and interested parties to review the source. If the rate or quantity does not match the rate or quantity from the source referenced, provide step-by-step instructions to tie the rate in the referenced source to the rate in the filing. \n\n(vi) Where a number is derived from another number by applying a load factor, percentage, or other adjusting factor not referenced in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, include workpapers and a narrative to explain the calculation of the adjusting factor. \n\n(2) If the natural gas company is adjusting its rates to reflect changes in transportation and compression costs paid to others: \n\n(i) The changes in transportation and compression costs must be based on the rate on file with the Commission. If the rate is not on file with the Commission or a discounted rate is paid, the rate reflected in the filing must be the rate the natural gas company is contractually obligated to pay; \n\n(ii) The filing must include appropriate credits for capacity released under § 284.243 of this chapter with workpapers showing the quantity released, the revenues received from the release, the time period of the release, and the natural gas pipeline on which the release took place; and, \n\n(iii) The filing must include a statement of the refunds received from each upstream natural gas company which are included in the rate adjustment. The statement must conform to the requirements set forth in § 154.501. \n\n(3) If the natural gas company is reflecting changes in its fuel reimbursement percentage, the filing must include: \n\n(i) A summary statement of actual gas inflows and outflows for each month used to calculate the fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge. For purposes of establishing the surcharge, the summary statement must be included for each month of the period over which the differences defined in paragraph (c) of this section accumulate. \n\n(ii) Where the fuel reimbursement percentage is calculated based on estimated activity over a future period, the period must be defined and the estimates used in the calculation must be justified. If any of the estimates are publicly available, include a reference to the source. \n\n(4) The natural gas company must not recover costs and is not obligated to return revenues which are applicable to the period pre-dating the effectiveness of the tariff language setting forth the periodic rate change mechanism, unless permitted or required to do so by the Commission. \n\n[Order 582, 60 FR 52996, Oct. 11, 1995, as amended by Order 714, 73 FR 57535, Oct. 3, 2008]",

(1) Any natural gas company that collects rates or charges pursuant to this chapter must refund that portion of any increased rates or charges either found by the Commission not to be justified, or approved for refund by the Commission as part of a settlement, together with interest as required in paragraph (d) of this section. The refund plus interest must be distributed as specified in the Commission order requiring or approving the refund, or if no date is specified, within 60 days of a final order. For purposes of this paragraph, a final order is an order no longer subject to rehearing. The pipeline is not required to make any refund until it has collected the refundable money through its rates. \n\n(2) Any natural gas company must refund to its jurisdictional customers the jurisdictional portion of any refund it receives which is required by prior Commission order to be flowed through to its jurisdictional customers or represents the refund of an amount previously included in a filing under § 154.403 and charged and collected from jurisdictional customers within thirty days of receipt or other time period established by the Commission or as established in the pipeline's tariff. \n\n(b) Costs of Refunding. Any natural gas company required to make refunds pursuant to this section must bear all costs of such refunding. \n\n(c) Supplier Refunds. The jurisdictional portion of supplier refunds (including interest received), applicable to periods in which a purchased gas adjustment clause was in effect, must be flowed through to the natural gas company's jurisdictional gas sales customers during that period with interest as computed in paragraph (d) of this section. \n\n(d) Interest on Refunds. Interest on the refund balance must be computed from the date of collection from the customer until the date refunds are made as follows: \n\n(1) At an average prime rate for each calendar quarter on all excessive rates or charges held (including all interest applicable to such rates and charges) on or after October 1, 1979. The applicable average prime rate for each calendar quarter must be the arithmetic mean, to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the prime rate values published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, or in the Federal Reserve's “Selected Interest Rates” (Statistical Release G, 13), for the fourth, third, and second months preceding the first month of the calendar quarter. \n\n(2) The interest required to be paid under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be compounded quarterly. \n\n(3) The refund balance must be either: \n\n(i) The revenues resulting from the collection of the portion of any increased rates or charges found by the Commission not to be justified; or \n\n(ii) An amount agreed upon in a settlement approved by the Commission; or \n\n(iii) The jurisdictional portion of a refund the natural gas company receives. \n\n(e) Unless otherwise provided by the order, settlement or tariff provision requiring the refund, the natural gas company must file a report of refunds, within 30 days of the date the refund was made, which complies with § 154.502 and includes the following: \n\n(1) Workpapers and a narrative sufficient to show how the refunds for jurisdictional services were calculated; \n\n(2) Workpapers and a narrative sufficient to determine the origin of the refund, including step-by-step calculations showing the derivation of the refund amount described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if necessary; \n\n(3) References to any publicly available sources which confirm the rates, quantities, or costs, which are used to calculate the refund balance or which confirm the refund amount itself. If the rate, quantity, cost or refund does not directly tie to the source, a workpaper must be included to show the reconciliation between the rate, quantity, cost, or refund in the natural gas company's report and the corresponding rate, quantity, cost or refund in the source document; \n\n(4) Workpapers showing the calculation of interest on a monthly basis, including how the carrying charges were compounded quarterly; \n\n(5) Workpapers and a narrative explaining how the refund was allocated to each jurisdictional customer. Where the numbers used to support the allocation are publicly available, a reference to the source must be included. Where the allocation methodology has been approved previously, a reference to the order or tariff provision approving the allocation methodology must be included. \n\n(6) A letter of transmittal containing: \n\n(i) A list of the material enclosed; \n\n(ii) The name and telephone number of a company official who can answer questions regarding the filing; \n\n(iii) A statement of the date the refund was disbursed; \n\n(iv) A reference to the authority by which the refund is made, including the specific subpart of these regulations, an order of the Commission, a provision of the company's tariff, or any other appropriate authority. If a Commission order is referenced, include the citation to the FERC Reports, the date of issuance, and the docket number; \n\n(v) Any requests for waiver. Requests must include a reference to the specific section of the statute, regulations, or the company's tariff from which waiver is sought, and a justification for the waiver. \n\n(7) A certification of service to all affected customers and interested state commissions. \n\n(f) Each report filed under paragraph (e) of this section must be posted no later than the date of filing. Each report must be posted to all recipients of a share of the refund and all state commissions whose jurisdiction includes the location of any recipient of a refund share that have made a standing request for such full report. \n\n(g) Recipients of refunds and state commissions that have not made a standing request for such full report shall receive an abbreviated report consisting of the items listed in § 154.501 (e)(5) and (e)(6). \n\n[Order 582, 60 FR 52996, Oct. 11, 1995, as amended by Order 582-A, 61 FR 9629, Mar. 11, 1996]",

Terms defined in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this subpart as they have under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. \n\n(b) Subpart F definitions. For purposes of this subpart: \n\n(1) Certificate holder means any interstate pipeline with an effective blanket certificate issued pursuant to this subpart. \n\n(2)(i) Eligible facility means, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, any facility subject to the Natural Gas Act jurisdiction of the Commission that is necessary to provide service within existing certificated levels. Eligible facility also includes any gas supply facility or any facility, including receipt points, needed by the certificate holder to receive gas into its system for further transport or storage, and interconnecting facilities between transporters that transport natural gas under part 284 of this chapter. Further, eligible facility includes main line, lateral, and compressor replacements that do not qualify under § 2.55(b) of this chapter because they will result in an incidental increase in the capacity of main line facilities, or because they will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of § 2.55(b). Replacements must be done for sound engineering purposes. Replacements for the primary purpose of creating additional main line capacity are not eligible facilities; however, replacements and the modification of facilities to rearrange gas flows or increase compression for the primary purpose of restoring service in an emergency due to sudden unforeseen damage to main line facilities are eligible facilities. Eligible facility also includes auxiliary installations and observation wells which do not qualify under § 2.55(a) of this chapter because they will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of § 2.55(a). Finally, for purposes of abandonment under § 157.216, eligible facilities include auxiliary installations that do not qualify for pre-granted abandonment authority under § 2.55(a)(3) and replacement facilities constructed under § 2.55(b).\n\n(ii) Exclusions: “Eligible facility” does not include:\n\n(A) A main line of a transmission system, except replacement facilities covered under § 157.202(b)(2)(i).\n\n(B) An extension of a main line, except replacement facilities covered under § 157.202(b)(2)(i).\n\n(C) A facility, including compression and looping, that alters the capacity of a main line, except replacement facilities and facility modifications covered under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; \n\n(D) A facility required to test or develop an underground storage field or that alters the certificated capacity, deliverability, or storage boundary, or a facility required to store gas above ground in either a gaseous or liquified state, or a facility used to receive gas from plants manufacturing synthetic gas or from plants gasifying liquefied natural gas, or wells needed to utilize an underground storage field.\n\n(E) Delivery points under § 157.211.\n\n(F) Temporary compression under § 157.209;\n\n(G) A facility that crosses a state line and is constructed for the primary purpose of transporting gas which is also transported by an intrastate pipeline under section 311(a)(2) of the NGPA;\n\n(3) Facility, for purposes of construction under this subpart, does not include an auxiliary facility that qualifies for construction under § 2.55(a) of this chapter or a replacement facility that qualifies for construction under § 2.55(b).\n\n(4) Temporary compression means compressor facilities installed and operated at existing compressor locations for the limited purpose of temporarily replacing existing permanent compressor facilities that are undergoing maintenance or repair or that are pending permanent replacement.\n\n(5) Main line means the principal transmission facilities of a pipeline system extending from supply areas to market areas and does not include small diameter supply or delivery laterals or gathering lines.\n\n(6) Miscellaneous rearrangement of any facility means any rearrangement of a facility, excluding underground storage injection/withdrawal wells, that does not result in any change of service rendered by means of the facilities involved, including changes in existing field operations or relocation of existing facilities: \n\n(i) On the same property;\n\n(ii) When required by highway construction, dam construction, encroachment of residential, commercial, or industrial areas, erosion, or the expansion or change of course of rivers, streams or creeks, or\n\n(iii) To respond to other natural forces beyond the certificate holder's control when necessary to ensure safety or maintain the operational integrity of the certificate holder's facilities.\n\n(7) Project means a unit of improvement or construction that is used and useful upon completion.\n\n(8) Project cost means the total actual cost of constructing the jurisdictional portions of a project. In the case of a project constructed jointly by more than one interstate pipeline, the project cost is the total cost, irrespective of the amount paid by each pipeline.\n\n(9) Right-of-way grantor means (i) a person who grants a right-of-way easement to the certificate holder; or (ii) any successor to an interest which is subject to the easement.\n\n(10) Delivery point means a tap and/or metering and appurtenant facilities, such as heaters, minor gas conditioning, treatment, odorization, and similar equipment, necessary to enable the certificate holder to deliver gas to any party.\n\n(11) Sensitive environmental area means:\n\n(i) The habitats of species which have been identified as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (Pub. L. 93-205, as amended) and essential fish habitat as identified under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq.);\n\n(ii) National or State Forests or Parks;\n\n(iii) Properties listed on, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places, or the National Register of Natural Landmarks;\n\n(iv) Floodplains and wetlands;\n\n(v) Designated or proposed wilderness areas, national or state wild and scenic rivers, wildlife refuges and management areas and sanctuaries;\n\n(vi) Prime agricultural lands, designated by the Department of Agriculture; or\n\n(vii) Sites which are subject to use by American Indians and other Native Americans for religious purposes.\n\n(12) Interconnection facilities means the interconnecting point, which includes the tap, metering, and M&R facilities and the related interconnecting pipeline.\n\n(13) Emergency means a sudden unanticipated loss of gas supply or capacity that requires an immediate restoration of interrupted service for protection of life or health or for maintenance of physical property.\n\n[Order 234, 47 FR 24266, June 4, 1982] \n\n\nEditorial Note:For Federal Register citations affecting § 157.202, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.govinfo.gov.",

If the interstate pipeline has curtailment provisions in its currently effective tariff, the tariff sheets or sections shall amend the existing curtailment provisions. If the interstate pipeline has no curtailment plan in its currently effective tariff, when it files tariff sheets or sections to amend its currently effective tariff to include a curtailment plan such curtailment plan shall comply with the requirements of this subpart. The tariff sheets or sections shall be filed no later than October 1, 1979, with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1979. The Data Verification Committee report prepared in accordance with § 281.213 shall be filed with the tariff sheets or sections. \n\n(b) Index of entitlements. (1) The index of entitlements for an interstate pipeline shall identify the natural gas entitlements in priority of service categories 1 and 2 (established in accordance with § 281.205(a)) for each direct sale customer, each local distribution company customer and each interstate pipeline purchaser on a daily, monthly, seasonal or other periodic basis used in the currently effective curtailment plan. \n\n(2) Periodic update. Each interstate pipeline shall update its index of entitlements annually to reflect changes in Priority 2 entitlements. The new index of requirements shall be filed on September 15 of each year with a proposed effective date of November 1, except that if the interstate pipeline uses a rolling base period in its currently effective curtailment plan it shall file its new index of entitlements on the date upon which other end-uses of the customers of the interstate pipeline are updated in accordance with the currently effective tariff. \n\n(3) Alternative fuel determination. The index of entitlements shall not include the volumes of natural gas for which volumes the essential agricultural user has the ability to use an alternative fuel, as determined under Subpart C of this part. Each interstate pipeline shall amend its index of entitlements pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to remove from the priority 2 entitlements and place in an appropriate priority of service category any such volumes or natural gas included in any index of entitlements that is effective on or after October 31, 1979.\n\n(c) Other tariff provisions. (1) Every tariff filed under this subpart shall contain provisions that will require the interstate pipeline: \n\n(i) To provide for deliveries of sufficient volumes of natural gas to respond to emergency situations (including environmental emergencies) during periods of curtailment where additional supplies are required to forestall irreparable injury to life or to property; and \n\n(ii) To provide for deliveries of sufficient volumes of natural gas to provide for minimum plant protection when the plant is shut down. \n\n(2) Volumetric delivery requirements. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, an interstate pipeline which is delivering natural gas in accordance with this subpart shall not be required to deliver to any customer volumes of natural gas on a daily, monthly, seasonal or other periodic basis which exceed the volumes of natural gas that the interstate pipeline may deliver to such customer without causing the interstate pipeline to violate any daily, monthly, seasonal or other periodic volumetric limitations established in the contract between the interstate pipeline and such customer. \n\n(Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. 3301-3432; Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352; E.O. 12009, 42 FR 46267; Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) \n\n[44 FR 26862, May 8, 1979, as amended at 44 FR 45923, Aug. 6, 1979; 44 FR 62490, Oct. 31, 1979; Order 55-B, 45 FR 54739, July 18, 1980; Order 145, 46 FR 27913, May 22, 1981; Order 714, 73 FR 57535, Oct. 3, 2008]",

A firm shipper may arrange for a replacement shipper to obtain its released capacity from the pipeline. A replacement shipper is any shipper that obtains released capacity.\n\n(2) The rate charged the replacement shipper for a release of capacity may not exceed the applicable maximum rate, except that no rate limitation applies to the release of capacity for a period of one year or less if the release is to take effect on or before one year from the date on which the pipeline is notified of the release. Payments or other consideration exchanged between the releasing and replacement shippers in a release to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section are not subject to the maximum rate.\n\n(c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a firm shipper that wants to release any or all of its firm capacity must notify the pipeline of the terms and conditions under which the shipper will release its capacity. The firm shipper must also notify the pipeline of any replacement shipper designated to obtain the released capacity under the terms and conditions specified by the firm shipper. \n\n(d) The pipeline must provide notice of offers to release or to purchase capacity, the terms and conditions of such offers, and the name of any replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section, on an Internet web site, for a reasonable period. \n\n(e) The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the release. If more than one person offers the highest rate and meets the terms and conditions of the release, the released capacity may be allocated on a basis provided in the pipeline's tariff, provided however, if the replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section offers the highest rate, the capacity must be allocated to the designated replacement shipper.\n\n(f) Unless otherwise agreed by the pipeline, the contract of the shipper releasing capacity will remain in full force and effect, with the net proceeds from any resale to a replacement shipper credited to the releasing shipper's reservation charge.\n\n(g) To the extent necessary, a firm shipper on an interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part is granted a limited-jurisdiction blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act solely for the purpose of releasing firm capacity pursuant to this section.\n\n(h)(1) The following releases need not comply with the bidding requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:\n\n(i) A release of capacity to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section;\n\n(ii) A release of capacity to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section;\n\n(iii) A release for more than one year at the maximum tariff rate; and\n\n(iv) A release for any period of 31 days or less.\n\n(v) If a release is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, notice of the release must be provided on the pipeline's Internet Web site as soon as possible, but not later than the first nomination, after the release transaction commences.\n\n(2) When a release of capacity is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, a firm shipper may not roll over, extend or in any way continue the release to the same replacement shipper using the 31 days or less bidding exemption until 28 days after the first release period has ended. The 28-day hiatus does not apply to any re-release to the same replacement shipper that is posted for bidding or that qualifies for any of the other exemptions from bidding in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.\n\n(3) A release to an asset manager exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section is any pre-arranged release that contains a condition that the releasing shipper may call upon the replacement shipper to deliver to, or purchase from, the releasing shipper a volume of gas up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand of the released transportation or storage capacity, as provided in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) through (h)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.\n\n(i) If the capacity release is for a period of one year or less, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of the lesser of five months (or 155 days) or the term of the release.\n\n(ii) If the capacity release is for a period of more than one year, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of five months (or 155 days) of each twelve-month period of the release, and on five-twelfths of the days of any additional period of the release not equal to twelve months.\n\n(iii) If the capacity release is a release of storage capacity, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation need only be up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand under the release for storage withdrawals or injections, as applicable.\n\n(4) A release to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section is any prearranged capacity release that will be utilized by the replacement shipper to provide the gas supply requirement of retail consumers pursuant to a retail access program approved by the state agency with jurisdiction over the local distribution company that provides delivery service to such retail consumers.\n\n[Order 636, 57 FR 13318, Apr. 16, 1992, as amended by Order 636-A, 57 FR 36217, Aug. 12, 1992; Order 577, 60 FR 16983, Apr. 4, 1995; Order 577-A, 60 FR 30187, June 8, 1995.

Any rate charged for transportation service under subparts B and G of this part must be established under a rate schedule that is filed with the Commission prior to commencement of such service and that conforms to the requirements of this section.\n\n(b) Rate objectives. Maximum rates for both peak and offpeak periods must be designed to achieve the following three objectives:\n\n(1) Rates for service during peak periods should ration capacity;\n\n(2) Rates for firm service during off-peak periods and for interruptible service during all periods should maximize throughput; and\n\n(3) The pipeline's revenue requirement allocated to firm and interruptible services should be attained by providing the projected units of service in peak and off-peak periods at the maximum rate for each service.\n\n(c) Rate design—(1) Volumetric rates. Except as provided in § 284.7(e), any rate filed for service subject to this section must be a one-part rate that recovers the costs allocated to the service to the extent that the projected units of that service are actually purchased and may not include a demand charge, a minimum bill or minimum take provision or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue. Such rate must separately identify cost components attributable to transportation, storage, and gathering costs.\n\n(2) Based on projected units of service. Any rate filed for service subject to this section must be designed to recover costs on the basis of projected units of service. The fixed costs allocated to capacity reservations, as determined in accordance with § 284.7(e), should be used along with the projected nominations accepted by the pipeline to compute the unit reservation fee. The remaining fixed costs and all variable costs should be used to determine the volumetric rate computed on the basis of projected volumes to be transported. The units projected for the service in rates filed under this section may be changed only in a subsequent rate filing under section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.\n\n(3) Differentiation due to time and distance. Any rate filed for service subject to this section must reasonably reflect any material variation in the cost of providing the service due to:\n\n(i) Whether the service is provided during a peak or an off-peak period; and\n\n(ii) The distance over which the transportation is provided.\n\n(4) Cost basis for rates.

An interstate pipeline that transports gas under subparts B or G of this part must comply with the following requirements. The regulations in this paragraph adopt the abbreviations and definitions contained in the North American Energy Standards Board Wholesale Gas Quadrant standards incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n(1) Nominations. \n\n(i) Intra-day nominations. \n\n(A) A pipeline must give scheduling priority to an intra-day nomination submitted by a firm shipper over nominated and scheduled volumes for interruptible shippers. When an interruptible shipper's scheduled volumes are to be reduced as a result of an intra-day nomination by a firm shipper, the interruptible shipper must be provided with advance notice of such reduction and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced. \n\n(B) An intra-day nomination submitted on the day prior to gas flow will take effect at the start of the gas day at 9 a.m. CCT. \n\n(ii) Capacity release scheduling. (A) Pipelines must permit shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. If the pipeline requires the replacement shipper to enter into a contract, the contract must be issued within one hour after the pipeline has been notified of the release, but the requirement for contracting must not inhibit the ability of the replacement shipper to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity. \n\n(B) A pipeline must permit releasing shippers, as a condition of a capacity release, to recall released capacity and renominate such recalled capacity at each nomination opportunity. Each replacement shipper must be provided with advance notice of such recall and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced. \n\n(iii) Within 60 days after a shipper request, a pipeline must file to make appropriate tariff changes at the Commission to allow multiple shippers associated with a designated agent or asset manager to be jointly and severally liable under a single firm transportation service agreement, subject to reasonable terms and conditions.\n\n(2) Flowing gas. (i) Operational balancing agreements. A pipeline must enter into Operational Balancing Agreements at all points of interconnection between its system and the system of another interstate or intrastate pipeline. \n\n(ii) Netting and trading of imbalances. A pipeline must establish provisions permitting shippers and their agents to offset imbalances accruing on different contracts held by the shipper with the pipeline and to trade imbalances with other shippers where such imbalances have similar operational impact on the pipeline's system. \n\n(iii) Imbalance management. A pipeline with imbalance penalty provisions in its tariff must provide, to the extent operationally practicable, parking and lending or other services that facilitate the ability of its shippers to manage transportation imbalances. A pipeline also must provide its shippers the opportunity to obtain similar imbalance management services from other providers and shall provide those shippers using other providers access to transportation and other pipeline services without undue discrimination or preference. \n\n(iv) Operational flow orders. A pipeline must take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impacts of operational flow orders (OFOs) or other measures taken to respond to adverse operational events on its system. A pipeline must set forth in its tariff clear standards for when such measures will begin and end and must provide timely information that will enable shippers to minimize the adverse impacts of these measures. \n\n(v) Penalties. A pipeline may include in its tariff transportation penalties only to the extent necessary to prevent the impairment of reliable service. Pipelines may not retain net penalty revenues, but must credit them to shippers in a manner to be prescribed in the pipeline's tariff. A pipeline with penalty provisions in its tariff must provide to shippers, on a timely basis, as much information as possible about the imbalance and overrun status of each shipper and the imbalance of the pipeline's system.\n\n(3) Communication protocols. (i)(A) All electronic information provided and electronic transactions conducted by a pipeline must be provided on the public Internet. A pipeline must provide, upon request, private network connections using internet tools, internet directory services, and internet communication protocols and must provide these networks with non-discriminatory access to all electronic information. A pipeline may charge a reasonable fee to recover the costs of providing such an interconnection. \n\n(B) A pipeline must implement this requirement no later than June 1, 2000. \n\n(ii) A pipeline must comply with the following requirements for documents constituting public information posted on the pipeline web site: \n\n(A) The documents must be accessible to the public over the public Internet using commercially available web browsers, without imposition of a password or other access requirement; \n\n(B) Users must be able to search an entire document online for selected words, and must be able to copy selected portions of the documents; and \n\n(C) Documents on the web site should be directly downloadable without the need for users to first view the documents on the web site. \n\n(iii) If a pipeline uses a numeric or other designation to represent information, an electronic cross-reference table between the numeric or other designation and the information represented must be available to users, at a cost not to exceed reasonable shipping and handling. \n\n(iv) A pipeline must provide the same content for all information regardless of the electronic format in which it is provided. \n\n(v) A pipeline must maintain, for a period of three years, all information displayed and transactions conducted electronically under this section and be able to recover and regenerate all such electronic information and documents. The pipeline must make this archived information available in electronic form for a reasonable fee. \n\n(vi) A pipeline must post notices of operational flow orders, critical periods, and other critical notices on its Internet web site and must notify affected parties of such notices in either of the following ways to be chosen by the affected party: Internet E-Mail or direct notification to the party's Internet URL address.\n\n(4) Communication and information sharing among pipelines and public utilities. (i) A pipeline is authorized to share non-public, operational information with a public utility, as defined in § 38.2(a) of this chapter or another pipeline covered by this section, for the purpose of promoting reliable service or operational planning.\n\n(ii) Except as permitted in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, a pipeline and its employees, contractors, consultants, and agents are prohibited from disclosing, or using anyone as a conduit for the disclosure of, non-public, operational information received from a public utility pursuant to § 38.2 of this chapter to a third party or to its marketing function employees as that term is defined in § 358.3(d) of this chapter.\n\n[Order 587, 61 FR 39068, July 26, 1996] \n\n\nEditorial Note:For Federal Register citations affecting § 284.12, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.govinfo.gov.",

          "content": "§ 284.123   Rates and charges.\n(a) General rule. Rates and charges for transportation of natural gas authorized under § 284.122(a) shall be fair and equitable as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(b) Election of rates. (1) Subject to the conditions in §§ 284.7 and 284.9 of this chapter, an intrastate pipeline may elect to:\n\n(i) Base its rates upon the methodology used:\n\n(A) In designing rates to recover the cost of gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery or similar service (including storage service) included in one of its then effective firm sales rate schedules for city-gate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency; or \n\n(B) In determining the allowance permitted by the appropriate state regulatory agency to be included in a natural gas distributor's rates for city-gate natural gas service; or\n\n(ii) To use the rates contained in one of its then effective transportation rate schedules for intrastate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency which the intrastate pipeline determines covers service comparable to service under this subpart. \n\n(2)(i) If an intrastate pipeline does not choose to make any election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall apply for Commission approval, by order, of the proposed rates and charges by filing with the Commission the proposed rates and charges, and information showing the proposed rates and charges are fair and equitable. Each petition for approval filed under this paragraph must be accompanied by the fee set forth in § 381.403 or by a petition for waiver pursuant to § 384.106 of this chapter. Upon filing the petition for approval, the intrastate pipeline may commence the transportation service and charge and collect the proposed rate, subject to refund.\n\n(ii) 150 days after the date on which the Commission received an application filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the rate proposed in the application will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service, unless within the 150 day period, the Commission either extends the time for action, or institutes a proceeding in which all interested parties will be afforded an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data and arguments. In such proceeding, the Commission either will approve the rate or disapprove the rate and order refund, with interest, of any amount which has been determined to be in excess of those shown to be fair and equitable or in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.\n\n(iii) A Commission order approving or disapproving a transportation rate under this paragraph supersedes a rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(c) Treatment of revenues. The Commission presumes that all revenues received by an intrastate pipeline in connection with transportation authorized under § 284.122(a) and computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been or will be taken into account by the appropriate state regulatory agency for purposes of establishing transportation charges by the intrastate pipeline for service to intrastate customers.\n\n(d) Presumptions. If the intrastate pipeline is charging a rate computed pursuant to § 284.123(b)(1), the rate charged is presumed to be:\n\n(1) Fair and equitable; and\n\n(2) Not in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service. \n\n(e) Filing requirements. Within 30 days of commencement of new service, any intrastate pipeline that engages in transportation arrangements under this subpart must file with the Commission a statement that includes the pipeline's interstate rates, the rate election made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and a description of how the pipeline will engage in these transportation arrangements, including operating conditions, such as quality standards and financial viability of the shipper. If the pipeline changes its operations, rates, or rate election under this subpart, it must amend the statement and file such amendments not later than 30 days after commencement of the change in operations or the change in rate election.\n\n(f) Electronic filing of statements, and related materials—(1) General rule. All filings made in proceedings initiated under this part must be made electronically, including rates and charges, or parts thereof, and material related thereto, statements, and all workpapers.\n\n(2) Requirements for signature. All filings must be signed in compliance with the following:\n\n(i) The signature on a filing constitutes a certification that the contents are true to the best knowledge and belief of the signer, and that the signer possesses full power and authority to sign the filing.\n\n(ii) A filing must be signed by one of the following:\n\n(A) The person on behalf of whom the filing is made;\n\n(B) An officer, agent, or employee of the company, governmental authority, agency, or instrumentality on behalf of which the filing is made; or,\n\n(C) A representative qualified to practice before the Commission under § 385.2101 of this chapter who possesses authority to sign.\n\n(iii) All signatures on the filing or any document included in the filing must comply, where applicable, with the requirements in § 385.2005 of this chapter with respect to sworn declarations or statements and electronic signatures.\n\n(3) Format requirements for electronic filing. The requirements and formats for electronic filing are listed in instructions for electronic filing and for each form. These formats are available through the Commission's website, https://www.ferc.gov.\n\n(g) Election of Notice Procedures—(1) Applicability. An intrastate pipeline filing for approval of rates, a statement of operating conditions, and any amendments or modifications thereto pursuant to this section may use the notice procedures in this paragraph. Any intrastate pipeline electing to use these notice procedures for a filing must clearly state its election to use these procedures in the filing. Such filing is approved and the rates deemed fair and equitable and not in excess of the amount that an interstate pipeline would be permitted to charge for similar transportation service if the requirements in paragraph (g)(8) of this section have been fulfilled.\n\n(2) Rejection of filing. The Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation or his designee shall reject within 7 days of the date of filing a request which patently fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, without prejudice to the intrastate pipeline refiling a complete application. If such filing was required by this section, that filing must be refiled within 14 days of the date of the rejection.\n\n(3) Publication of notice of filing. The Secretary of the Commission shall issue a notice of the filing within 10 days of the date of the filing, which will then be published in the Federal Register. The notice shall designate a deadline for filing interventions, initial comments, final comments, and protests to the filing. The deadline for interventions and initial comments shall be 21 days after the date of the filing or such other date established by the Secretary of the Commission. The deadline for final comments and protests shall be 60 days after the date of the filing or such other date established by the Secretary of the Commission.\n\n(4) Protests. (i) Any person or the Commission's staff may file a protest prior to the deadline for protests.\n\n(ii) Protests shall be filed with the Commission in the form required by Part 385 of this chapter including a detailed statement of the protestor's interest in the filing and the specific reasons and rationale for the objection and whether the protestor seeks to be an intervenor.\n\n(5) Effect of protest. If a protest is filed in accordance with paragraph (g)(4) of this section, then the intrastate pipeline, the person who filed the protest, any intervenors and Commission staff shall have 30 days from the deadline for filing protests established by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section, to resolve the protest, and to file a withdrawal of the protest pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section. Informal settlement conferences may be convened by the Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation or his designee during this 30 day period. If a protest is not withdrawn or dismissed by end of that 30 day period, the filing shall not be deemed approved pursuant to this paragraph. Within 60 days from the deadline for filing protests established by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section the Commission will establish procedures to resolve the proceeding.\n\n(6) Withdrawal of protests. The protestor may withdraw a protest by submitting written notice of withdrawal to the Secretary of the Commission pursuant to § 385.216 of this chapter and serving a copy on the intrastate pipeline, any intervenors, and any person who has filed a motion to intervene in the proceeding.\n\n(7) Amendments or modifications to tariff records prior to approval. An intrastate pipeline may file to amend or modify a tariff record contained in the initial filing pursuant to the procedures under this paragraph (g) which has not yet been approved pursuant to paragraph (g)(8) of this section. Such filing will toll the notice period established in paragraph (g)(3) of this section and the Secretary of the Commission will issue a notice establishing new deadlines for comments and protests for the entire filing pursuant to paragraph (g)(3).\n\n(8) Final approval. (i) If no protest is filed within the time allowed by the Secretary of the Commission under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the filing by the intrastate pipeline is approved, effective on the date proposed in the filing requesting approval unless the intrastate pipeline withdraws, amends, or modifies its filing or the filing is rejected pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.\n\n(ii) If any protest is filed within the time allowed by the Secretary of the Commission under paragraph (g)(3) of this section and is subsequently withdrawn before the end of the 30-day reconciliation period provided by paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the filing by the intrastate pipeline is approved effective on the date proposed in the filing requesting approval unless the intrastate pipeline withdraws, amends, or modifies its filing or the filing is rejected pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.\n\n(9) Periodic rate review. Rates of pipelines approved by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph are required to be periodically reviewed.\n\n(i) Any intrastate pipeline with rates so approved must file an application for rate approval under this section on or before the date five years following the date it filed the application for authorization of rates pursuant to this paragraph. Any Hinshaw pipeline that has been a granted a blanket certificate under § 284.224 of this chapter and with rates approved pursuant to this paragraph must on or before the date five years following the date it filed the application for authorization of the rates pursuant to this paragraph either file under this section cost, throughput, revenue and other data, in the form specified in § 154.313 of this chapter, to allow the Commission to determine whether any change in rates is required pursuant to section 5 of the Natural Gas Act or an application for rate authorization pursuant to this section.\n\n(ii) An intrastate pipeline with rates approved pursuant to the rate election in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that remain unchanged during the five-year review period which were approved based on then effective state rates may file a certification with the Commission pursuant to this paragraph (g) that the rates continue to comply on the same basis with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such certification of rates will meet the periodic rate review requirement set forth in this paragraph (g)(9) unless the Commission determines that further proceedings concerning the rates are appropriate.\n\n(iii) If the state rate used pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for approval of a rate pursuant to this paragraph (g) is changed, not later than 30 days after that changed rate becomes effective, the intrastate pipeline must file a new rate election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(10) Withdrawal of filing prior to approval. A pipeline may, pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, withdraw in its entirety a filing made pursuant to paragraph (g) that has not been approved by filing a withdrawal motion with the Commission. A filing that is withdrawn will not fulfill the requirements under paragraph (g)(8) of this section.\n\n(h) Withdrawal of filing. A pipeline may withdraw in its entirety a filing pursuant to this section that has not been approved by filing a withdrawal motion with the Commission.\n\n(1) The withdrawal motion must state that any amounts collected subject to refund in excess of the rates authorized the Commission will be refunded with interest calculated and a refund report filed with the Commission in accordance with § 154.501 of this chapter. The refunds must be made within 60 days of the date the withdrawal motion becomes effective.\n\n(2) The withdrawal motion will become effective, and the filing will be deemed withdrawn at the end of 15 days from the date of filing of the withdrawal motion, if no order disallowing the motion is issued within that period. If an answer in opposition is filed within the 15-day period, the withdrawal is not effective until an order accepting the withdrawal is issued.\n\n[44 FR 52184, Sept. 7, 1979, as amended at 44 FR 66791, Nov. 21, 1979; Order 394, 49 FR 35364, Sept. 7, 1984; Order 436, 50 FR 42496, Oct. 18, 1985; 50 FR 52276, Dec. 23, 1985; Order 581, 60 FR 53073, Oct. 11, 1995; Order 714, 73 FR 57535, Oct. 3, 2008; Order 781, 78 FR 45862, July 30, 2013; Order 849, 83 FR 36715, July 30, 2018; Order 849-B, 86 FR 29506, June 2, 2021; Order 899, 88 FR 74031, Oct. 30, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 292.207   Procedures for obtaining qualifying status.\n(a) Self-certification—(1) FERC Form No. 556. The qualifying facility status of an existing or a proposed facility that meets the requirements of § 292.203 may be self-certified by the owner or operator of the facility or its representative by properly completing a FERC Form No. 556 and filing that form with the Commission, pursuant to § 131.80 of this chapter, and complying with paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(2) Factors. For small power production facilities pursuant to § 292.204, the owner or operator of the facility or its representative may, when completing the FERC Form No. 556, provide information asserting factors showing that the facility for which qualification or recertification is sought is at a separate site from other facilities using the same energy resource and owned by the same person(s) or its affiliates.\n\n(3) Commission action. Self-certification and self-recertification are effective upon filing. If no protests to a self-certification or self-recertification are timely filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, no further action by the Commission is required for a self-certification or self-recertification to be effective. If protests to a self-certification or self-recertification are timely filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, a self-certification or self-recertification will remain effective until the Commission issues an order revoking QF certification. The Commission will act on the protest within 90 days from the date the protest is filed; provided that, if the Commission requests more information from the protester, the entity seeking qualification or recertification, or both, the time for the Commission to act will be extended to 60 days from the filing of a complete answer to the information request. In addition to any extension resulting from a request for information, the Commission also may toll the 90-day period for one additional 60-day period if so required to rule on a protest. Authority to toll the 90-day period for this purpose is delegated to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. Absent Commission action before the expiration of the tolling period, a protest will be deemed denied, and the self-certification or self-recertification will remain effective.\n\n(b) Optional procedure—Commission certification—(1) Application for Commission certification. In lieu of the self-certification procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator of an existing or a proposed facility, or its representative, may file with the Commission an application for Commission certification that the facility is a qualifying facility. The application must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by part 381 of this chapter, and the applicant for Commission certification must comply with paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(2) General contents of application. The application must include a properly completed FERC Form No. 556 pursuant to § 131.80 of this chapter. For small power production facilities pursuant to § 292.204, the owner or operator of the facility or its representative may, when completing the FERC Form No. 556, provide information asserting factors showing that the facility for which qualification is sought is at a separate site from other facilities using the same energy resource and owned by the same person(s) or its affiliates.\n\n(3) Commission action. (i) Within 90 days of the later of the filing of an application or the filing of a supplement, amendment or other change to the application, the Commission will either: Inform the applicant that the application is deficient; or issue an order granting or denying the application; or toll the time for issuance of an order. Any order denying certification shall identify the specific requirements which were not met. If the Commission does not act within 90 days of the date of the latest filing, the application shall be deemed to have been granted.\n\n(ii) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the date an application is filed is the date by which the Office of the Secretary has received all of the information and the appropriate filing fee necessary to comply with the requirements of this Part.\n\n(c) Protests and Interventions—(1) Filing a Protest. Any person, as defined in § 385.102(d) of this chapter, who opposes either a self-certification or self-recertification making substantive changes to the existing certification filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or an application for Commission certification or Commission recertification making substantive changes to the existing certification filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for which qualification or recertification is filed on or after December 31, 2020, may file a protest with the Commission. Any protest to and any intervention in a self-certification or self-recertification must be filed in accordance with §§ 385.211 and 385.214 of this chapter, on or before 30 days from the date the self-certification or self-recertification is filed. Any protestor must concurrently serve a copy of such filing pursuant to § 385.211 of this chapter. Any protest must be adequately supported, and provide any supporting documents, contracts, or affidavits to substantiate the claims in the protest.\n\n(2) Limitations on protest. Protests may be filed to any initial self-certification or application for Commission certification filed on or after the effective date of this final rule, and to any self-recertification or application for Commission recertification that are filed on or after December 31, 2020 that makes substantive changes to the existing certification. Once the Commission has certified an applicant's qualifying facility status either in response to a protest opposing a self-certification or self-recertification, or in response to an application for Commission certification or Commission recertification, any later protest to a self-recertification or application for Commission recertification making substantive changes to a qualifying facility's certification must demonstrate changed circumstances that call into question the continued validity of the certification.\n\n(d) Response to protests. Any response to a protest must be filed on or before 30 days from the date of filing of that protest and will be allowed under § 385.213(a)(2) of this chapter.\n\n(e) Notice requirements—(1) General. An applicant filing a self-certification, self-recertification, application for Commission certification or application for Commission recertification of the qualifying status of its facility must concurrently serve a copy of such filing on each electric utility with which it expects to interconnect, transmit or sell electric energy to, or purchase supplementary, standby, back-up or maintenance power from, and the State regulatory authority of each state where the facility and each affected electric utility is located. The Commission will publish a notice in the Federal Register for each application for Commission certification and for each self-certification of a cogeneration facility that is subject to the requirements of § 292.205(d).\n\n(2) Facilities of 500 kW or more. An electric utility is not required to purchase electric energy from a facility with a net power production capacity of 500 kW or more until 90 days after the facility notifies the facility that it is a qualifying facility or 90 days after the utility meets the notice requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.\n\n(f) Revocation of qualifying status. (1)(i) If a qualifying facility fails to conform with any material facts or representations presented by the cogenerator or small power producer in its submittals to the Commission, the notice of self-certification or Commission order certifying the qualifying status of the facility may no longer be relied upon. At that point, if the facility continues to conform to the Commission's qualifying criteria under this part, the cogenerator or small power producer may file either a notice of self-recertification of qualifying status pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, or an application for Commission recertification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate.\n\n(ii) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the motion of any person, revoke the qualifying status of a facility that has been certified under paragraph (b) of this section, if the facility fails to conform to any of the Commission's qualifying facility criteria under this part.\n\n(iii) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the motion of any person, revoke the qualifying status of a self-certified or self-recertified qualifying facility if it finds that the self-certified or self-recertified qualifying facility does not meet the applicable requirements for qualifying facilities.\n\n(2) Prior to undertaking any substantial alteration or modification of a qualifying facility which has been certified under paragraph (b) of this section, a small power producer or cogenerator may apply to the Commission for a determination that the proposed alteration or modification will not result in a revocation of qualifying status. This application for Commission recertification of qualifying status should be submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n[45 FR 17972, Mar. 20, 1980]\n\n\nEditorial Note:For Federal Register citations affecting § 292.207, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.govinfo.gov.",

The mitigative measures will be on file and available to inspect or to download on the Commission's website, https://www.ferc.gov.\n\n(2) The Commission will provide the State and interested persons within 90 days from the date the notice is issued to review and submit comments on the mitigative measures. The applicant for license or exemption has 15 days after the expiration of the public comment period to respond to the comments filed with the Commission.\n\n(i) Material amendments to application. The proposed mitigative measures filed under paragraph (g)(2) of this section will not be considered a material amendment to the application unless the Commission finds that the proposed measures are unnecessary to, or exceed the scope of, mitigating substantial adverse effects. If the Commission finds the proposed mitigative measures constitute a material amendment, the application will be considered filed with the Commission on the date on which the applicant filed the proposed mitigative measures, and all other provisions of § 4.35(a) of this chapter will apply.\n\n(j) Final determination on the petition. The Commission will make a final determination on the petition at the time the Commission issues a license or exemption for the project.\n\n(k) Presumption. (1) If, between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition, the State does not take any action under § 292.208(b)(2), the failure to take action can be the basis for a presumption that there is not substantial adverse effect on the environment (as that term is defined in § 292.202(q)).\n\n(2) If the presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section comes into effect, it:\n\n(i) Is only available for those adverse effects related to the natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes of the environment;\n\n(ii) Can only operate during the time between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition; and\n\n(iii) Has no affect on the Commission's independent obligation to find that the project will not have a substantial adverse effect on the environment under § 292.208(b)(1).\n\n(3) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section does not take effect if the State, the Commission or an interested person demonstrates that the State has acted to protect the natural watercourse under § 292.208(b)(2).\n\n(4) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section can be rebutted if:\n\n(i) The Commission determines that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section; or\n\n(ii) Any interested person, including a State, demonstrates that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n[Order 499, 53 FR 27004, July 18, 1988, as amended by Order 499-A, 53 FR 40724, Oct. 18, 1988; Order 699, 72 FR 45325, Aug. 14, 2007; Order 899, 88 FR 74032, Oct. 30, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 292.302   Availability of electric utility system cost data.\n(a) Applicability. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, paragraph (b) applies to each electric utility, in any calendar year, if the total sales of electric energy by such utility for purposes other than resale exceeded 500 million kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding calendar year.\n\n(2) Each utility having total sales of electric energy for purposes other than resale of less than one billion kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding year, shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until June 30, 1982.\n\n(b) General rule. To make available data from which avoided costs may be derived, not later than November 1, 1980, June 30, 1982, and not less often than every two years thereafter, each regulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall provide to its State regulatory authority, and shall maintain for public inspection, and each nonregulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall maintain for public inspection, the following data:\n\n(1) The estimated avoided cost on the electric utility's system, solely with respect to the energy component, for various levels of purchases from qualifying facilities. Such levels of purchases shall be stated in blocks of not more than 100 megawatts for systems with peak demand of 1000 megawatts or more, and in blocks equivalent to not more than 10 percent of the system peak demand for systems of less than 1000 megawatts. The avoided costs shall be stated on a cents per kilowatt-hour basis, during daily and seasonal peak and off-peak periods, by year, for the current calendar year and each of the next 5 years;\n\n(2) The electric utility's plan for the addition of capacity by amount and type, for purchases of firm energy and capacity, and for capacity retirements for each year during the succeeding 10 years; and\n\n(3) The estimated capacity costs at completion of the planned capacity additions and planned capacity firm purchases, on the basis of dollars per kilowatt, and the associated energy costs of each unit, expressed in cents per kilowatt hour. These costs shall be expressed in terms of individual generating units and of individual planned firm purchases.\n\n(c) Special rule for small electric utilities. (1) Each electric utility (other than any electric utility to which paragraph (b) of this section applies) shall, upon request:\n\n(i) Provide comparable data to that required under paragraph (b) of this section to enable qualifying facilities to estimate the electric utility's avoided costs for periods described in paragraph (b) of this section; or\n\n(ii) With regard to an electric utility which is legally obligated to obtain all its requirements for electric energy and capacity from another electric utility, provide the data of its supplying utility and the rates at which it currently purchases such energy and capacity.\n\n(2) If any such electric utility fails to provide such information on request, the qualifying facility may apply to the State regulatory authority (which has ratemaking authority over the electric utility) or the Commission for an order requiring that the information be provided.\n\n(d) Substitution of alternative method. (1) After public notice in the area served by the electric utility, and after opportunity for public comment, any State regulatory authority may require (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority), or any non-regulated electric utility may provide, data different than those which are otherwise required by this section if it determines that avoided costs can be derived from such data.\n\n(2) Any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated utility which requires such different data shall notify the Commission within 30 days of making such determination. \n\n(e) State Review. (1) Any data submitted by an electric utility under this section shall be subject to review by the State regulatory authority which has ratemaking authority over such electric utility.\n\n(2) In any such review, the electric utility has the burden of coming forward with justification for its data.\n\n[45 FR 12234, Feb. 25, 1980; 45 FR 24126, Apr. 9, 1980]",

Each electric utility shall purchase, in accordance with § 292.304, unless exempted by § 292.309 and § 292.310, any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility:\n\n(1) Directly to the electric utility; or\n\n(2) Indirectly to the electric utility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(b) Obligation to sell to qualifying facilities. Each electric utility shall sell to any qualifying facility, in accordance with § 292.305, unless exempted by § 292.312, energy and capacity requested by the qualifying facility.\n\n(c) Obligation to interconnect. (1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any electric utility shall make such interconnection with any qualifying facility as may be necessary to accomplish purchases or sales under this subpart. The obligation to pay for any interconnection costs shall be determined in accordance with § 292.306.\n\n(2) No electric utility is required to interconnect with any qualifying facility if, solely by reason of purchases or sales over the interconnection, the electric utility would become subject to regulation as a public utility under part II of the Federal Power Act.\n\n(d) Transmission to other electric utilities. If a qualifying facility agrees, an electric utility which would otherwise be obligated to purchase energy or capacity from such qualifying facility may transmit the energy or capacity to any other electric utility. Any electric utility to which such energy or capacity is transmitted shall purchase such energy or capacity under this subpart as if the qualifying facility were supplying energy or capacity directly to such electric utility. The rate for purchase by the electric utility to which such energy is transmitted shall be adjusted up or down to reflect line losses pursuant to § 292.304(e)(4) and shall not include any charges for transmission.\n\n(e) Parallel operation. Each electric utility shall offer to operate in parallel with a qualifying facility, provided that the qualifying facility complies with any applicable standards established in accordance with § 292.308.\n\n[Order 688, 71 FR 64372, Nov. 1, 2006; 71 FR 75662, Dec. 18, 2006]",

          "content": "§ 292.304   Rates for purchases.\n(a) Rates for purchases. (1) Rates for purchases shall:\n\n(i) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest; and\n\n(ii) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.\n\n(2) Nothing in this subpart requires any electric utility to pay more than the avoided costs for purchases.\n\n(b) Relationship to avoided costs. (1) For purposes of this paragraph, “new capacity” means any purchase from capacity of a qualifying facility, construction of which was commenced on or after November 9, 1978.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a rate for purchases satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the rate equals the avoided costs determined after consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section\n\n(3) A rate for purchases (other than from new capacity) may be less than the avoided cost if the State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated electric utility determines that a lower rate is consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, and is sufficient to encourage cogeneration and small power production.\n\n(4) Rates for purchases from new capacity shall be in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether the electric utility making such purchases is simultaneously making sales to the qualifying facility.\n\n(5) In the case in which the rates for purchases are based upon estimates of avoided costs over the specific term of the contract or other legally enforceable obligation, the rates for such purchases do not violate this subpart if the rates for such purchases differ from avoided costs at the time of delivery.\n\n(6) Locational Marginal Price. There is a rebuttable presumption that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Locational Marginal Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located in a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g).\n\n(7) Competitive Price. A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Competitive Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located outside a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g). A Competitive Price may be either a Market Hub Price or a Combined Cycle Price, determined as follows:\n\n(i) A Market Hub Price is a price established at a liquid market hub which a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility determines represents an appropriate measure of the electric utility's avoided cost for as-available energy, and is a hub to which the electric utility has reasonable access, based on an evaluation by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\n(A) Whether the hub is sufficiently liquid that prices at the hub represent a competitive price;\n\n(B) Whether prices developed at the hub are sufficiently transparent;\n\n(C) Whether the electric utility has the ability to deliver power from such hub to its load, even if its load is not directly connected to the hub; and\n\n(D) Whether the hub represents an appropriate market to derive an energy price for the electric utility's purchases from the relevant qualifying facility given the electric utility's physical proximity to the hub or other factors.\n\n(ii) A Combined Cycle Price is a price determined pursuant to a formula established by a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility using published natural gas price indices, a proxy heat rate, and variable operations and maintenance costs for an efficient natural gas combined-cycle generating facility. Before establishing such a formula rate, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility must determine that the resulting Combined Cycle Price represents an appropriate measure of the purchasing electric utility's avoided cost for energy, based on its evaluation of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\n(A) Whether the cost of energy from an efficient natural gas combined cycle generating facility represents a reasonable measure of a competitive price in the purchasing electric utility's region;\n\n(B) Whether natural gas priced pursuant to particular proposed natural gas price indices would be available in the relevant market;\n\n(C) Whether there should be an adjustment to the natural gas price to appropriately reflect the cost of transporting natural gas to the relevant market; and\n\n(D) Whether the proxy heat rate used in the formula should be updated regularly to reflect improvements in generation technology.\n\n(8) Competitive Solicitation Price. (i) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a price determined pursuant to a competitive solicitation process to establish qualifying facility energy and/or capacity rates for sales to electric utilities, provided that such competitive solicitation process is conducted pursuant to procedures ensuring the solicitation is conducted in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) The solicitation process is an open and transparent process that includes, but is not limited to, providing equally to all potential bidders substantial and meaningful information regarding transmission constraints, levels of congestion, and interconnections, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards;\n\n(B) Solicitations are open to all sources, to satisfy that electric utility's capacity needs, taking into account the required operating characteristics of the needed capacity;\n\n(C) Solicitations are conducted at regular intervals;\n\n(D) Solicitations are subject to oversight by an independent administrator; and\n\n(E) Solicitations are certified as fulfilling the above criteria by the relevant state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility through a post-solicitation report.\n\n(ii) To the extent that the electric utility procures all of its capacity, including capacity resources constructed or otherwise acquired by the electric utility, through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the electric utility shall be presumed to have no avoided capacity costs unless and until it determines to acquire capacity outside of such competitive solicitation process. However, the electric utility shall nevertheless be required to purchase energy from qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogeneration facilities.\n\n(iii) To the extent that the electric utility does not procure all of its capacity through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, then there shall be no presumption that the electric utility has no avoided capacity costs.\n\n(c) Standard rates for purchases. (1) There shall be put into effect (with respect to each electric utility) standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less.\n\n(2) There may be put into effect standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of more than 100 kilowatts.\n\n(3) The standard rates for purchases under this paragraph: \n\n(i) Shall be consistent with paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section; and \n\n(ii) May differentiate among qualifying facilities using various technologies on the basis of the supply characteristics of the different technologies. \n\n(d) Purchases “as available” or pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation. (1) Each qualifying facility shall have the option either:\n\n(i) To provide energy as the qualifying facility determines such energy to be available for such purchases, in which case the rates for such purchases shall be based on the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery; or\n\n(ii) To provide energy or capacity pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation for the delivery of energy or capacity over a specified term, in which case the rates for such purchases shall, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be based on either:\n\n(A) The avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or\n\n(B) The avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred.\n\n(iii) The rate for delivery of energy calculated at the time the obligation is incurred may be based on estimates of the present value of the stream of revenue flows of future locational marginal prices, or Competitive Prices during the anticipated period of delivery.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may require that rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation vary through the life of the obligation, and be set at the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery.\n\n(3) Obtaining a legally enforceable obligation. A qualifying facility must demonstrate commercial viability and financial commitment to construct its facility pursuant to criteria determined by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility as a prerequisite to a qualifying facility obtaining a legally enforceable obligation. Such criteria must be objective and reasonable.\n\n(e) Factors affecting rates for purchases. (1) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility based on a purchasing electric utility's locational marginal price calculated by the applicable market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g), or the purchasing electric utility's applicable Competitive Price. Alternatively, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy and/or capacity from a qualifying facility based on a Competitive Solicitation Price. To the extent that capacity rates are not set pursuant to this section, capacity rates shall be set pursuant to subsection (2).\n\n(2) To the extent that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility does not set energy and/or capacity rates pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following factors shall, to the extent practicable, be taken into account in determining rates for purchases from a qualifying facility:\n\n(i) The data provided pursuant to § 292.302(b), (c), or (d), including State review of any such data;\n\n(ii) The availability of capacity or energy from a qualifying facility during the system daily and seasonal peak periods, including:\n\n(A) The ability of the electric utility to dispatch the qualifying facility;\n\n(B) The expected or demonstrated reliability of the qualifying facility;\n\n(C) The terms of any contract or other legally enforceable obligation, including the duration of the obligation, termination notice requirement and sanctions for non-compliance;\n\n(D) The extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facility can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the electric utility's facilities;\n\n(E) The usefulness of energy and capacity supplied from a qualifying facility during system emergencies, including its ability to separate its load from its generation;\n\n(F) The individual and aggregate value of energy and capacity from qualifying facilities on the electric utility's system; and\n\n(G) The smaller capacity increments and the shorter lead times available with additions of capacity from qualifying facilities; and\n\n(iii) The relationship of the availability of energy or capacity from the qualifying facility as derived in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, to the ability of the electric utility to avoid costs, including the deferral of capacity additions and the reduction of fossil fuel use; and\n\n(iv) The costs or savings resulting from variations in line losses from those that would have existed in the absence of purchases from a qualifying facility, if the purchasing electric utility generated an equivalent amount of energy itself or purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity.\n\n(f) Periods during which purchases not required. (1) Any electric utility which gives notice pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section will not be required to purchase electric energy or capacity during any period during which, due to operational circumstances, purchases from qualifying facilities will result in costs greater than those which the utility would incur if it did not make such purchases, but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy itself.\n\n(2) Any electric utility seeking to invoke paragraph (f)(1) of this section must notify, in accordance with applicable State law or regulation, each affected qualifying facility in time for the qualifying facility to cease the delivery of energy or capacity to the electric utility.\n\n(3) Any electric utility which fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section will be required to pay the same rate for such purchase of energy or capacity as would be required had the period described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section not occurred.\n\n(4) A claim by an electric utility that such a period has occurred or will occur is subject to such verification by its State regulatory authority as the State regulatory authority determines necessary or appropriate, either before or after the occurrence.\n\n[Order 69, 45 FR 12234, Feb. 25, 1980, as amended by Order 872, 85 FR 54733, Sept. 2, 2020]",

In determining whether a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of transactions within the relevant market; or\n\n(3) Wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(b) For purposes of § 292.309(a), a renewal of a contract that expires by its own terms is a “new contract or obligation” without a continuing obligation to purchase under an expired contract.\n\n(c) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, with the exception of paragraph (d) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory access to the market if it is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, and Commission-approved interconnection rules.\n\n(1) If the Commission determines that a market meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, and if a qualifying facility in the relevant market is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, a qualifying facility may seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating, inter alia, that it does not have access to the market because of operational characteristics or transmission constraints.\n\n(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may additionally seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating that it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;\n\n(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;\n\n(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section;\n\n(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;\n\n(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or\n\n(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.\n\n(d)(1) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying cogeneration facility with a capacity at or below 20 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.\n\n(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity at or below 5 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.\n\n(3) Nothing in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) affects the rights the rights or remedies of any party under any contract or obligation, in effect or pending approval before the appropriate State regulatory authority or non-regulated electric utility on or before February 16, 2021, to purchase electric energy or capacity from or to sell electric energy or capacity to a small power production facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts under this Act (including the right to recover costs of purchasing electric energy or capacity).\n\n(4) For purposes of implementing paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the Commission will not be bound by the standards set forth in § 292.204(a)(2).\n\n(e) Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), ISO New England Inc. (ISO-NE), and New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) qualify as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than 5 megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to those markets through Commission-approved open access transmission tariffs and interconnection rules, and that electric utilities that are members of such regional transmission organizations or independent system operators should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.\n\n(1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating, inter alia, that:\n\n(i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or\n\n(ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.\n\n(2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;\n\n(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;\n\n(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);\n\n(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;\n\n(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or\n\n(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.\n\n(f) The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) qualifies as a market described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than five megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to that market through Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved open access protocols, and that electric utilities that operate within ERCOT should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.\n\n(1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating, inter alia, that:\n\n(i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or\n\n(ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.\n\n(2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;\n\n(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;\n\n(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);\n\n(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;\n\n(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or\n\n(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.\n\n(g) The California Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. satisfy the criteria of § 292.309(a)(2)(i).\n\n(h) No electric utility shall be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase from or sell electric energy to a facility that is not an existing qualifying cogeneration facility unless the facility meets the criteria for new qualifying cogeneration facilities established by the Commission in § 292.205.\n\n(i) For purposes of § 292.309(h), an “existing qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that:\n\n(1) Was a qualifying cogeneration facility on or before August 8, 2005; or\n\n(2) Had filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification or self-recertification, or an application for Commission certification, under § 292.207 prior to February 2, 2006.\n\n(j) For purposes of § 292.309(h), a “new qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that satisfies the criteria for qualifying cogeneration facilities pursuant to § 292.205.\n\n[Order 688, 71 FR 64372, Nov. 1, 2006; 71 FR 75662, Dec. 18, 2006; Order 872, 85 FR 54735, Sept. 2, 2020; 85 FR 86725, Dec. 30, 2020]",

An exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company, or its representative, may file with the Commission a notice of self-certification demonstrating that it satisfies the definition of exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company (including stating the location of its generation); such notices of self-certification must be subscribed, consistent with § 385.2005(a) of this chapter, but need not be verified. In the case of exempt wholesale generators, the person filing a notice of self-certification under this section must also file a copy of the notice of self-certification with the state regulatory authority of the state in which the facility is located, and that person must also represent to this Commission in its submittal with this Commission that it has filed a copy of the notice of self-certification with the state regulatory authority of the state in which the facility is located. Notice of the filing of a notice of self-certification will be published in the Federal Register. Persons that file a notice of self-certification must include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications in § 385.203(d) of this chapter. A person filing a notice of self-certification in good faith will be deemed to have temporary exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status. If the Commission takes no action within 60 days from the date of filing of the notice of self-certification, the self-certification shall be deemed to have been granted; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)) any self-certification of an exempt wholesale generator may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary (if such determinations are not necessary, the notice of self-certification should state so). The Commission may toll the 60-day period to request additional information, or for further consideration of the request; in such cases, the person's exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status will remain temporary until such time as the Commission has determined whether to grant or deny exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)), any self-certification of an exempt wholesale generator may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary (if such determinations are not necessary, the notice of self-certification should state so). Authority to toll the 60-day period is delegated to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and authority to act on uncontested notices of self-certification is delegated to the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee.\n\n(b) Optional procedure for Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status or foreign utility company status. A person may file for a Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status or foreign utility company status under § 366.1 by filing a petition for declaratory order pursuant to § 385.207(a) of this chapter, justifying the request for such status; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)), a Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary. (If such determinations are not necessary, the petition for declaratory order should state so.) Persons that file petitions must include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications in § 385.203(d) of this chapter.\n\n(c) Procedure for notification of material change in facts. If there is any material change in facts that may affect an exempt wholesale generator's or a foreign utility company's status as an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company, the exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company shall within 30 days of the material change in facts:\n\n(1) Submit a new notice of self-certification or a new petition for declaratory order, pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate;\n\n(2) File a written explanation why the material change in facts does not affect its status; or\n\n(3) Notify the Commission that it no longer seeks to maintain its exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status.\n\n(d) Revocation of status. (1) If an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company fails to conform to the criteria for such status or fails to conform with any material facts or representations presented in its submittals to the Commission, the notice of self-certification of the status of the facility or Commission order certifying the status of the facility may no longer be relied upon.\n\n(2) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the complaint of any person, revoke the status of a facility or company, if the facility or company fails to conform to any of the criteria under this part for such status. \n\n(e) An exempt wholesale generator shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7, i.e., procedures for obtaining exempt wholesale generator status. A foreign utility company shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7, i.e., procedures for obtaining foreign utility company status.\n\n[Order 667-A, 71 FR 28457, May 16, 2006, as amended by Order 667-B, 71 FR 42756, July 28, 2006]",

However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.\n\n(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any related profit, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee must compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless:\n\n(i) It is practicable for the company to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and\n\n(ii) The implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n(iii) If both of those conditions are met, the lessee must use the implicit rate.\n\n(b) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement must be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section must be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, must be considered as a new agreement and must be classified according to the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) must not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.",

An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost must be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\n\n(b) The service company must initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), and charge the associated asset retirement costs to service company property (including account 101.1 in § 367.1011) related to the property that gives rise to the legal obligation.

The earnings and expenses during construction must constitute a component of construction costs.\n\n(19) Training costs. When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain property that is being constructed and the property is not conventional in nature, or is new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once property is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs must cease and subsequent training costs must be expensed.

Each company must maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of property and apply the listing consistently.\n\n(b) The addition and retirement of retirement units must be accounted for as follows:\n\n(1) When a retirement unit is added, the related cost must be added to the appropriate service company property account.\n\n(2) When a retirement unit is retired, with or without replacement, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included, determined in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to service company property must be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to the property. The cost of removal and the salvage must be charged or credited, as appropriate, to the depreciation account.\n\n(c) The addition and retirement of minor items of property must be accounted for as follows:\n\n(1) When a minor item of property that did not previously exist is added to service company property, the related cost must be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge must be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.\n\n(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable property, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation must be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when the unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when the minor item is retired.\n\n(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement must be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item. However, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment must be charged to the appropriate property account.\n\n(d) The book cost of service company property retired must be the amount at which the property is included in the property accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost must be determined from the service company's records and, if this cannot be done, it must be estimated. Service companies must furnish the particulars of the estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or related small cost, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, must be used as the book cost of the units retired.\n\n(e) The book cost of land retired must be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for related depreciation or amortization that has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be recorded in accounts 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211) or 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212), as appropriate.\n\n(f) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable service company property retired must be charged in its entirety to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of service company property (§ 367.1080).\n\n(g) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 303, Miscellaneous intangible property (§ 367.3030), and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, must be as provided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated provision for amortization of service company property (§ 367.1110), account 404, Amortization of limited-term property (§ 367.4040), and account 405, Amortization of other property (§ 367.4050).",

A meeting or a portion of a meeting may be closed only when the Commission votes by a majority of the membership to close the meeting. A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each Commission meeting or portion of a meeting which is proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series.

Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a meeting or a portion of a meeting requests that the Commission close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (a) (5), (6), or (7) of § 375.205, the Commission, upon request of any one of its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting. \n\n(c) Release of vote.

Prior to a determination that a meeting should be closed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the General Counsel of the Commission shall publicly certify that, in his opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision.

          "content": "§ 376.209   Continuity of Operations Plan and suspension of Commission operations.\n(a)(1)(i) Activation of COOP and suspension of Commission operations. The Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan may be activated by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate). In circumstances in which the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission headquarters operations may be temporarily disrupted in whole or in part or communications with Commission headquarters may be temporarily unavailable, either of which may prevent the public or the Commission from meeting regulatory or statutory requirements. After the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission operations other than emergency functions may be suspended in whole or in part by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate). The provisions of this section are effective upon activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and the subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, and shall remain in effect up to 30 days, or such shorter time than 30 days as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate, or such longer time than 30 days as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to section 376.204 of this Part, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate. Resumption of Commission operations following activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and any subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, may occur either simultaneously for all activities, or over time for just some activities, and in such manner and at such time, as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) or the Commission (or the Commission's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate.\n\n(ii) Notification of COOP activation and, following such activation, notification of suspension of Commission operations. During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) will notify the public that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part by sending a press release announcing that fact to major wire services, industry press, and appropriate metropolitan area radio stations The Commission's Web site (http://www.ferc.gov) or the Commission's alternative Web site (http://www.fercalt.gov), as appropriate, will be activated and a notice that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part will be prominently displayed thereon. The Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, will act as a resource for the press, industry, and general public. An additional press release will be sent to appropriate media outlets and a notice will be prominently displayed on the Commission's Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, when the Continuity of Operations Plan is deactivated and the Commission's headquarters are reopened or reconstituted and Commission operations resume.\n\n(2) Activities continued during COOP. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, during periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Commission will continue to conduct emergency functions. As part of its emergency functions, the Commission will act on requests to ensure continued construction of essential natural gas facilities with sensitive construction timelines, on Commencement of Service requests, and on completion of dam safety work, in a manner consistent with the maintenance of environmental protections. Also as part of its emergency functions, the Commission will ensure that its personnel are available to respond to plant accidents or reportable incidents at LNG facilities, and to address dam safety, public safety, and security incidents at jurisdictional hydropower projects and to address other matters involving the safety of human life or protection of property. Alternate channels of communication will include measures to ensure that these activities can go forward unhindered.\n\n(b) Standards of conduct for transmission service providers. During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, a Transmission Provider affected by the same emergency affecting the Commission may, for up to 30 days, or such other time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) may direct, delay compliance with the requirement to report to the Commission each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the standards of conduct within 24 hours of such deviation. If the emergency prevents such Transmission Provider from posting information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, the Transmission Provider may, for up to 30 days, or such shorter time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) may direct or such longer time as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to § 376.204, as appropriate) may direct, also delay compliance with the requirements of § 358.4(a)(2) of this chapter to post this information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, as applicable.\n\n(c) Tolling of time periods for Commission action. Unless otherwise directed, for those pending matters where the date that the Commission must act falls during the period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part and also during the 14 days thereafter, the Commission tolls, for purposes of further consideration, the time period in which the Commission must act. Such matters include:\n\n(1) 60-day period to act on requests for Exempt Wholesale Generator or Foreign Utility Company status;\n\n(2) 90-day period for acting on requests for certification of qualifying facility status;\n\n(3) 60-day period for acting on interlocking directorate applications;\n\n(4) 60-day period for acting on Public Utility Holding Company Act exemptions and waivers;\n\n(5) 180-period for acting on applications under section 203 of the Federal Power Act;\n\n(6) 150-day period for acting on intrastate pipeline applications for approval of proposed rates;\n\n(7) Period ending 60 days prior to the Electric Reliability Organization's (ERO) fiscal year for acting on the ERO's budget;\n\n(8) 60-day period for acting on notifications that a Reliability Standard may conflict with a function, rule, order, tariff, rate schedule or agreement;\n\n(9) 60-day period for acting on applications for review of a penalty imposed by the ERO for violation of a Reliability Standard;\n\n(10) 45-day protest period for protesting Prior Notice Filings, and the 30-day period for resolving and filing to withdraw such Protests;\n\n(11) 30-day period for acting on requests for rehearing;\n\n(12) Time periods for action by a presiding officer or the Motions Commissioner, as well as by the Commission, on motions to permit interlocutory appeals, interlocutory appeals and certified questions; and\n\n(13) 90-day period for acting on applications requesting relief from, or reinstatement of, an electric utility's mandatory purchase obligation pursuant to section 210(m) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.\n\n(d) Suspension of certain requirements. Unless otherwise directed, during periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, the requirements to file by a certain date are suspended when communications with Commission headquarters are unavailable such that filings, submissions, and notifications cannot be received by the Commission. Unless otherwise directed by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate), those filings, submissions, and notifications, the filing of which was suspended, will be due the first day that communications with Commission headquarters are available such that filings, submissions, and notifications can be received by the Commission. Such filings, submissions, and notifications include:\n\n(1) Filings to comply with orders or notices, including orders or notices issued by the Commission, a presiding officer, and a Commission decisional employee (including the directors of the Commission's various offices and their delegates);\n\n(2) Filings required to be made by a date certain either under the Commission's regulations, or under orders and notices issued by the Commission, a presiding officer, and a Commission decisional employee (including the directors of the Commission's various offices and their delegates); such filings include, e.g., briefs, motions, and answers to motions;\n\n(3) Motions to intervene and notices of intervention, or protests;\n\n(4) Comments responding to notices of inquiry, proposed rulemakings or technical conferences;\n\n(5) Responses to data requests and deficiency letters issued either by the Commission or by a decisional employee pursuant to delegated authority;\n\n(6) Self-reports of violations;\n\n(7) Responses to staff audit reports;\n\n(8) Contacts with the Commission's Enforcement Hotline;\n\n(9) Accounting filings required by the Commission's Uniform Systems of Accounts;\n\n(10) Forms required to be filed by a date certain;\n\n(11) Notices of intent to file new applications and applications for new licenses pursuant to section 15 of the Federal Power Act;\n\n(12) Requests for rehearing of orders and letter orders issued either by the Commission or by a decisional employee pursuant to delegated authority; and\n\n(13) The Electric Reliability Organization's advising the Commission of the Electric Reliability Organization's intent to issue Level 1 Advisories, Level 2 Recommendations, and Level 3 Essential Actions, and the Electric Reliability Organization's reporting to the Commission on actions taken in response to Level 2 Recommendations and Level 3 Essential Actions.\n\n(e) Acceptance and suspension of rate and other filings. Unless otherwise directed, if the date by which the Commission is required to act on rate and other filings made pursuant to section 4 of the Natural Gas Act, section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and section 6(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act falls during a period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part and also during the 14 days thereafter, such filings shall be deemed to be accepted for filing and suspended and made effective on the requested effective date, subject to refund and further order of the Commission. The acceptance for filing and suspension of these filings is without prejudice to any further action the Commission may take with respect to these filings.\n\n(f) Electric Reliability Organization penalties. Unless otherwise directed, if the date a penalty imposed by the Electric Reliability Organization under section 215 of the Federal Power Act would take effect falls during a period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part and also during the 14 days thereafter, review of such penalty by the Commission shall be deemed to be initiated and the penalty shall be stayed pending further action of the Commission.\n\n(g) Consistency of State action with Reliability Standard.

(i) Unless an objection to discovery under this section is based on the ground that production would impose an undue burden, the objecting participant must provide the participant seeking discovery with a schedule of items withheld and a statement of: \n\n(A) The character and specific subject matter of each item; and \n\n(B) The specific objection asserted for each item. \n\n(ii) If an objection under this section is based on the ground that production of the requested material would impose an undue burden, the objecting participant must provide the participant seeking discovery with a description of the approximate number of documents that would have to be produced and a summary of the information contained in such documents. \n\n(3) Objections to other discovery requests. If the discovery to which objection is made is not a request for documents, the objection must clearly state the grounds on which the participant bases its objection. \n\n(4) Objections to compile or process information. The fact that information has not been compiled or processed in the form requested is not a basis for objection unless the objection presents grounds for limiting discovery under paragraph (c) of this section. \n\n(b) Motions to compel. Any participant seeking discovery may file a motion to compel discovery, if: \n\n(1) A participant to whom a data request is made or upon whom an interrogatory is served under Rule 406 fails or refuses to make a full, complete, and accurate response; \n\n(2) A person named in a notice of intent to take a deposition or a subpoena fails or refuses to appear for the deposition; \n\n(3) An organization named in a notice of intent to take a deposition fails or refuses to designate one or more persons to testify on its behalf under Rule 404(b)(3); \n\n(4) A deponent fails or refuses to answer fully, completely, and accurately a question propounded or to sign the transcript of the testimony as required by Rule 404(f)(2); \n\n(5) A participant upon whom a request for admissions is served fails or refuses to respond to the request in accordance with Rule 408(b); or \n\n(6) A participant upon whom an order to produce or to permit inspection or entry is served under Rule 407 fails or refuses to comply with that order. \n\n(c) Orders limiting discovery. A presiding officer may, by order, deny or limit discovery or restrict public disclosure of discoverable matter in order to:\n\n(1) Protect a participant or other person from undue annoyance, burden, harassment or oppression; \n\n(2) Prevent undue delay in the proceeding; \n\n(3) Preserve a privilege of a participant, person, or governmental agency; \n\n(4) Prevent a participant from requiring another participant to provide information which is readily available to the requesting participant from other sources with a reasonable expenditure of effort given the requesting participant's position and resources; \n\n(5) Prevent unreasonably cumulative or duplicative discovery requests; or \n\n(6) Provide a means by which confidential matters may be made available to participants so as to prevent public disclosure. Material submitted under a protective order may nevertheless be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests and review. \n\n(d) Privilege—(1) In general. (i) In the absence of controlling Commission precedent, privileges will be determined in accordance with decisions of the Federal courts with due consideration to the Commission's need to obtain information necessary to discharge its regulatory responsibilities. \n\n(ii) A presiding officer may not quash a subpoena or otherwise deny or limit discovery on the ground of privilege unless the presiding officer expressly finds that the privilege claimed is applicable. If a presiding officer finds that a qualified privilege has been established, the participant seeking discovery must make a showing sufficient to warrant discovery despite the qualified privilege. \n\n(iii) A presiding officer may issue a protective order under Rule 410(c) to deny or limit discovery in order to preserve a privilege of a participant, person, or governmental agency. \n\n(2) Of the Commission. (i) If discovery under this subpart would require the production of Commission information, documents, or other matter that might fall within a privilege, the Commission trial staff must identify in writing the applicable privilege along with the matters claimed to be privileged or the individuals from whom privileged information is sought, to the presiding officer and the parties. \n\n(ii) If the presiding officer determines that the privilege claimed for the Commission is applicable, the Commission information, documents, or other matter may not be produced. If the presiding officer determines that no privilege is applicable, that a privilege is waived, or that a qualified privilege is overcome, the presiding officer will certify the matter to the Commission in accordance with Rule 714. Certification to the Commission under this paragraph must describe the material to be disclosed and the reasons which, in the presiding officer's view, justify disclosure. The information will not be disclosed unless the Commission affirmatively orders the material disclosed. \n\n[Order 225, 47 FR 19022, May 3, 1982, as amended by Order 466-A, 52 FR 35910, Sept. 24, 1987]",

(1) Participants may, subject to the limitations of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, use alternative means of dispute resolution to resolve all or part of any pending matter if the participants agree. The alternative means of dispute resolution authorized under subpart F of this part will be voluntary procedures that supplement rather than limit other available dispute resolution techniques.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the decisional authority will not consent to use of an alternative dispute resolution proceeding if:\n\n(i) A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value;\n\n(ii) The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and the proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy;\n\n(iii) Maintaining established policies is of special importance;\n\n(iv) The matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;\n\n(v) A full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide a record; or\n\n(vi) The Commission must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the Commission's fulfilling that requirement.\n\n(3) If one or more of the factors outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is present, alternative dispute resolution may nevertheless be used if the alternative dispute resolution proceeding can be structured to avoid the identified factor or if other concerns significantly outweigh the identified factor.\n\n(4) A determination to use or not to use a dispute resolution proceeding under subpart F of this part is not subject to judicial review.\n\n(5) Settlement agreements reached through the use of alternative dispute resolution pursuant to subpart F of this part will be subject to the provisions of Rule 602, unless the decisional authority, upon motion or otherwise, orders a different procedure.\n\n(b) Definitions. For the purposes of subpart F of this part:\n\n(1) Alternative means of dispute resolution means any procedure that is used, in lieu of an adjudication, to resolve issues in controversy, including but not limited to, settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials, and arbitration, or any combination thereof;\n\n(2) Award means any decision by an arbitrator resolving the issues in controversy;\n\n(3) Dispute resolution communication means any oral or written communication prepared for the purposes of a dispute resolution proceeding, including any memoranda, notes or work product of the neutral, parties or non-party participant.

Any participant who receives the notice and within 15 calendar days does not offer to defend a refusal of the neutral to disclose the requested information waives any objection to the disclosure. \n\n(f) Nothing in Rule 606 prevents the discovery or admissibility of any evidence that is otherwise discoverable, merely because the evidence was presented in the course of a dispute resolution proceeding. \n\n(g) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not preclude disclosure of information and data that are necessary to document an agreement reached or order issued pursuant to a dispute resolution proceeding. \n\n(h) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not prevent the gathering of information for research and educational purposes, in cooperation with other agencies, governmental entities, or dispute resolution programs, so long as the participants and the specific issues in controversy are not identifiable. \n\n(i) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not prevent use of a dispute resolution communication to resolve a dispute between the neutral in a dispute resolution proceeding and a participant in the proceeding, so long as the communication is disclosed only to the extent necessary to resolve the dispute. \n\n(j) Nothing in this section precludes parties from seeking privileged treatment for documents under this chapter. \n\n(k) Where disclosure is authorized by this section, nothing in this section precludes use of a protective agreement or protective orders. \n\n(l) A dispute resolution communication that may not be disclosed under this rule shall also be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).\n\n[Order 578, 60 FR 19508, Apr. 19, 1995, as amended by Order 602, 64 FR 17099, Apr. 8, 1999; Order 769, 77 FR 65476, Oct. 29, 2012]",

(1) Within 20 days after the commencement of a proceeding, the Secretary:\n\n(i) Will file with the Secretary for the presiding officer a copy of the contested order; and\n\n(ii) May, in addition, elect to file a statement setting forth the factual elements of the alleged violation, which statement the Secretary will serve on all participants in the proceeding.\n\n(2) If the petitioner requests permission to raise new facts or issues pursuant to Rule 907(a) (new facts and issues), the Secretary may file, within 10 days after the filing of the petitioner's answer, a reply responding to the petitioner's request to raise new facts or issues. In the reply, the Secretary may also request the permission of the presiding officer to raise new facts or issues under the criteria set forth in Rule 907(b) (new facts and issues) and to conduct discovery relating to the new facts or issues he may raise pursuant to Rule 907(b) (new facts and issues). Failure by the Secretary to request permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery in this reply constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Secretary will file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon other participants in the proceedings, a brief in support of the affirmative case, which will set forth:\n\n(i) The elements of the alleged violation, including references to the authorities upon which the Secretary relies, including but not limited to regulations, rulings, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission; and\n\n(ii) A complete statement of the factual and legal basis of the contested order.\n\n(4) The Secretary's brief will be filed according to the following time period appropriate to the particular proceeding:\n\n(i) If no participant (including persons requesting intervention) has requested permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), (c)(7), and (c)(8) of this section, within 20 days after the filing of the petitioner's answer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;\n\n(ii) If the presiding officer has determined, under Rule 908(d) (discovery) that no discovery shall be permitted, within 20 days after the presiding officer's determination under such rule;\n\n(iii) If discovery is permitted under Rule 908(d) (discovery) within 20 days after the conclusion of the time period set for discovery under such rule;\n\n(b) By the petitioner. (1) Within 15 days after petitioner gives written notice to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199C(b) that petitioner wishes to appeal the remedial order, the petitioner must file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon the Secretary and other participants in the proceedings, an answer to the contested order admitting or denying each of the Secretary's findings in the contested order and setting forth affirmative defenses, if any. Each answer filed with the Secretary of the Commission by the petitioner, in accordance with this paragraph, must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by § 381.303 of this chapter.\n\n(2) In the answer, the petitioner may:\n\n(i) Contest any part of the record; \n\n(ii) Request permission to raise new facts or issues not raised in the prior proceedings if the new facts or issues meet the criteria set forth in Rule 907(a) (new facts and issues); and \n\n(iii) Request permission to conduct discovery, subject to criteria provided in Rule 908(a) (discovery). Failure by the petitioner to contest the record or to request permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery in this answer constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.\n\n(3) Within 15 days after filing of the Secretary's brief under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the petitioner shall file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon other participants in the proceeding, a brief stating fully the objections to the contested order, including references to the authorities upon which the petitioner relies, including but not limited to regulations, rulings, interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission.\n\n(c) By interveners. (1) A person qualifying under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may request the presiding officer to permit intervention in the proceeding under this subpart in accordance with the procedures described in this paragraph.\n\n(2) A motion to intervene may be filed by any person claiming:\n\n(i) An interest which may be directly affected and which is not adequately protected by existing parties and as to which the persons requesting intervention may be bound by the Commissions action in the proceeding; or\n\n(ii) Any other interest of such nature that participation by the person requesting intervention may be in the public interest.\n\n(3) A motion to intervene must set forth clearly and concisely the facts from which the nature of the requester's alleged right or interest can be determined, the grounds of the proposed intervention, and the position of the intervener in the proceeding, so as fully and completely to advise the participants and the presiding officer as to the specific issues of fact or law to be raised or controverted, by admitting, denying, or otherwise answering, specifically and in detail, each material allegation of fact or law raised or controverted, including references to the authorities upon which the requester relies, including, but not limited to, regulations, rulings, interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission.\n\n(4) Motions to intervene may be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, within 20 days after the commencement of the proceeding under Rule 904 (commencement of proceedings) unless, in extraordinary circumstances and for good cause shown, the presiding officer authorizes a late filing. A person requesting intervention must serve the motion to intervene on the participants in the proceeding at the same time the request is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.\n\n(5) A participant in the proceedings may file an answer to a motion to intervene. Failure to object constitutes a waiver of any objection to the granting of such request. If made, answers must be filed within 15 days after the filing of the request to intervene.\n\n(6) After expiration of the time for filing answers to requests to intervene or default thereof, as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the presiding officer will grant or deny such request, in whole or in part, or may, if found to be appropriate, authorize limited participation. The presiding officer will serve the determination on a motion to intervene upon the participants in the proceeding and upon the person requesting intervention. A person wholly or partially denied intervention may take an interlocutory appeal of the order denying intervention, under Rule 715 (interlocutory appeals to the Commission from rulings of presiding officers), and will be considered a “participant” (as that term is defined in Rule 102(b) (definitions)) for the limited purpose of permitting that person to file an interlocutory appeal under Rule 715 (interlocutory appeals to the Commission from rulings of presiding officers) contesting denial, in whole or in part, of that person's motion to intervene.\n\n(7) A person filing a motion to intervene, may request therein the permission of the presiding officer to raise new facts or issues not raised in the prior proceedings on the contested order, if the new facts or issues meet the criteria set forth in Rule 903(c) (request for nondisclosure of information). Failure by the person requesting permission to intervene to request permission to raise new facts or issues in the motion to intervene constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.\n\n(8) A person filing a motion to intervene may request the permission of the presiding officer to conduct discovery, subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 908(c) (discovery). Failure by the person requesting permission to intervene to request permission to conduct discovery in the motion to intervene constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.\n\n(d) Attachments of pleadings. (1) Each party will file, as an appendix to each pleading which cites documents in the record developed in the prior proceedings on the remedial order, one copy of each such document in its entirety and, if any such document contains information exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Rule 903, a second copy of such document with such information deleted. The top of the first page of each such document will contain the word “PUBLIC” or “NONPUBLIC,” to indicate whether it contains such exempt information.\n\n(2) One copy of each version shall be served on counsel for the petitioner and/or the Secretary, and one copy of the PUBLIC version shall be served on counsel for each other participant separately represented unless the conditions of Rule 903 are met, in which situation such counsel shall be served with copies of both versions.\n\n(3) In compiling their appendices, the parties will include only documents specifically cited and relied upon in their pleadings. They will have regard for the fact that the Secretary's entire administrative record is always available to the Commission and will not include irrelevant or duplicative documents in the appendices.\n\n[Order 225, 47 FR 19022, May 3, 1982, as amended by Order 395, 49 FR 35357, Sept. 7, 1984; Order 416, 50 FR 15733, Apr. 22, 1985; Order 416-A, 50 FR 36054, Sept. 5, 1985]",

          "content": "§ 385.1305   Joint and concurrent hearings (Rule 1305).\n(a) The term “joint hearing” used in sections 209 and 17, respectively, of the Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts is understood to cover any hearing in which members of the Commission and members of one or more State commissions may sit together in a proceeding pending before one such commission, whether or not a proceeding or proceedings involving similar or corresponding issues be pending before any other commission.\n\n(b) Two different types of proceedings have been called “joint hearings”. One is that type of proceeding where members of one or more State commissions sit with members of the Commission for information or in an advisory capacity. The State commissioners in such case do not develop a record for their respective commissions and may not, at their own discretion, make a recommendation to the Commission. The other type of joint hearing is often referred to as a “concurrent hearing”. Under this procedure the Commission and one or more State commissions sit together to hear and jointly make a record upon a matter over which all of the participating commissions have jurisdiction and responsibility for action.\n\n(c) The Commission or any State commission or commissions should feel free to suggest or request a joint or concurrent hearing at any time. It is believed that the concurrent hearing is the type of cooperative hearing which is likely to be most useful and effective.\n\n(d) Whenever a concurrent hearing has been agreed upon by the Commission and one or more State commissions, the procedure will be:\n\n(1) Each commission will designate the representative or representatives of such commission to sit at such concurrent hearing, and will designate the representative who will be the presiding officer for such commission.\n\n(2) It will be understood that participation in such concurrent hearing will in no way affect the complete control by each commission of the proceeding before it. It will be understood, also, that participation in either a joint or concurrent hearing will in no way preclude any commission from causing to be presented in any such case pertinent evidence with respect to matters in issue.\n\n(3) The representative designated by the Commission will be the presiding officer to announce rulings with respect to which there is no disagreement; and such rulings will be considered concurrent rulings. However, the presiding officer for any commission which does not concur in any ruling may announce a divergent ruling and such divergent ruling, whether with respect to the admissibility of evidence or any other matter, will be considered the ruling for his or her commission.\n\n(4) The record of the concurrent hearing will be the record of each commission participating, except that, if divergent rulings are made, the rulings will be reported so as to separate and distinguish clearly the record of the respective participating commissions and the evidence admitted in each record, in accordance with the rulings of the respective commissions. If, in any proceeding, the ruling of one presiding officer has the effect of admitting any voluminous exhibit or testimony which is excluded by the ruling of another presiding officer, the taking of such evidence, whenever possible, will be deferred until after the completion of the proceedings which can be conducted under concurrent rulings. When such testimony is taken, the transcript of such evidence will be made available to the participating commissions, if desired.\n\n(5) In all respects concerning which there is no divergence of ruling, the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the Commission, subject to the express understanding that each participating State commission will control its own record and make its own rulings as to the admissibility of evidence and as to other matters affecting its proceedings, and will make its own separate final decision or order therein.\n\n(e) Before either the Commission or a participating State commission will enter any order or orders in a concurrent proceeding, opportunity will be afforded for conference between the Commission and the State commissions participating.\n\n(f) Whenever a joint hearing other than a concurrent hearing is agreed upon, the commissioners which take part therein will agree upon the procedure to be followed in such hearing in advance of the opening of the same. With respect to any concurrent hearing, a special agreement may be made by the commissions taking part therein for a procedure or action differing from that outlined in this plan.\n\n(g) Cooperation between two or more commissions in a concurrent hearing will preclude either from taking the position of an advocate or a litigant. If a commission wishes to take such a position, it will not be a cooperating participant in that proceeding. In such situation the appropriate method of procedure will be intervention under Rule 214.",

(i) The request must be accompanied by a statement that to the best of the applicant's personal information, knowledge, and belief there is no untrue statement of a material or relevant fact and there is no omission of a material or relevant fact made in the request.\n\n(ii) Any untrue statement or omission of a material or relevant fact upon which the Office of the General Counsel relied in a request for an interpretation is deemed to be a statement or entry under section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code.\n\n(5) Notification of other parties. (i) A person submitting a request must specify each person who is a direct participant in the circumstance, act or transaction; must notify them in writing of the request for an interpretation; and must send them a copy of such request. Such notification and the addresses of the persons notified must be included in a request to the General Counsel.\n\n(ii) Each person notified pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section may submit information regarding any fact provided in the request of which it has personal knowledge, if such fact is different from the facts presented by the applicant. Such fact must be presented to the Office of the General Counsel as set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(6) The request must be accompanied by the fee prescribed in § 381.405 of this chapter or by a petition for waiver pursuant to § 381.106 of this chapter. \n\n(e) Additional information. The General Counsel may request additional information, documentation or legal analysis in connection with any request for any interpretation.\n\n(f) Referral of information. Information submitted in a request for interpretation may be used by the Commission or its Staff in their official capacity. Any information received will be placed in a public file in the Commission's Office of Public Information.\n\n(g) The interpretation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the General Counsel will provide a copy of his or her written interpretation of the NGPA or rule as applied to the act, transaction, or circumstance presented upon the person who made the request for the interpretation and upon persons named in the request as direct participants in the act, transaction, or circumstance.\n\n(2) The General Counsel may determine not to issue an interpretation, in which case the person who made the request and direct participants as specified in the request will be notified in writing of the decision not to issue an interpretation, and the reason for the decision.\n\n(3) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically addressed and other persons who are named in the request, who have been informed by the applicant for an interpretation of the pendency of the request and who are direct participants in the act, transaction or circumstance presented, may rely upon it. The effectiveness of an interpretation depends entirely on the accuracy of the facts presented to the General Counsel. If a material or relevant fact has been misrepresented or omitted or if any material or relevant fact changes after an interpretation is issued or if the action taken differs from the facts presented in the request, the interpretation may not be relied upon by any person.\n\n(4) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified prospectively at any time. A rescission or modification is effected by notifying persons entitled to rely on the interpretation at the address contained in the original request.\n\n(5) Any interpretation based on the NGPA or a rule issued thereunder in effect at the time of issuance may be relied upon only to the extent such law or rule remains in effect.\n\n(6) Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(3), (g)(4) and (g)(5) of this section, the Staff will not recommend any action to the Commission which is inconsistent with the position espoused in the interpretation. The interpretation of the General Counsel is not the interpretation of the Commission. An interpretation provided by the General Counsel is given without prejudice to the Commission's authority to consider the same or like question and to issue a declaratory order to take other action which has the effect of rescinding, revoking, or modifying the interpretation of the General Counsel.\n\n(h) Appeal. There is no appeal to the Commission of an interpretation.\n\n(i) Interpretative rules. Upon the petition of any person or upon its own motion, the Commission may publish in the Federal Register an interpretative rule regarding any question arising under the NGPA or a rule promulgated thereunder. Any person is entitled to rely upon an interpretative rule.\n\n(j) Applications for adjustments treated as requests for interpretations. Except for the notification provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the provisions of this section apply to any petition for an adjustment which is deemed a request for an interpretation under Rule 1117. Notice to all parties to an adjustment proceeding under subpart K of this part that is deemed to be a request for an interpretation will be given under Rule 1117(d)(1).\n\n[Order 225, 47 FR 19022, May 3, 1982, as amended by Order 394, 49 FR 35366, Sept. 7, 1984; Order 737, 75 FR 43405, July 26, 2010]",

This section governs off-the-record communications with the Commission in a manner that permits fully informed decision making by the Commission while ensuring the integrity and fairness of the Commission's decisional process. This rule will apply to all contested on-the-record proceedings, except that the Commission may, by rule or order, modify any provision of this subpart, as it applies to all or part of a proceeding, to the extent permitted by law. \n\n(b) General rule prohibiting off-the-record communications. Except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section, in any contested on-the-record proceeding, no person outside the Commission shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any decisional employee, and no decisional employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any person outside the Commission, any off-the-record communication. \n\n(c) Definitions.

Responses will also be placed in the non-public decisional file and held confidential. If the Commission determines that the communication does not contain sensitive national security-related information, it will be placed in the decisional file.\n\n(h) Public notice requirement of prohibited and exempt off-the-record communications. (1) The Secretary will, not less than every 14 days, issue a public notice listing any prohibited off-the-record communications or summaries of the communication received by his or her office. For each prohibited off-the-record communication the Secretary places in the non-decisional public file under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the notice will identify the maker of the off-the-record communication, the date the off-the-record communication was received, and the docket number to which it relates. \n\n(2) The Secretary will not less than every 14 days, issue a public notice listing any exempt off-the-record communications or summaries of the communication received by the Secretary for inclusion in the decisional record and required to be disclosed under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. \n\n(3) The public notice required under this paragraph (h) will be posted in accordance with § 388.106 of this chapter, as well as published in the Federal Register, and disseminated through any other means as the Commission deems appropriate. \n\n(i) Sanctions.

(1) The Commission may, by rule or order, modify any provision of this section as it applies to all or part of a proceeding, to the extent permitted by law. \n\n(2) The provisions of this section are not intended to limit the authority of a decisional employee to decline to engage in permitted off-the-record communications, or where not required by any law, statute or regulation, to make a public disclosure of any exempted off-the-record communication.\n\n[Order 607-A, 65 FR 71254, Nov. 30, 2000, as amended by Order 623, 66 FR 67482, Dec. 31, 2001; Order 699, 72 FR 45328, Aug. 14, 2007; Order 718, 73 FR 62886, Oct. 22, 2008; Order 756, 77 FR 4895, Feb. 1, 2012]",

For any Commission approval not assigned an expiration date, the Commission's approval shall expire five years from the approval date unless prior thereto the Commission extends the approval for an additional period of up to five years, based upon a written request from the project sponsor accompanied by supporting documentation demonstrating that the following criteria have been met:\n\n(i) No material changes to the project as approved are proposed;\n\n(ii) The condition of the project site has not changed in a manner important to determining whether the project would substantially impair or conflict with the Commission's Comprehensive Plan;\n\n(iii) The Commission's Comprehensive Plan has not changed in a manner important to determining whether the project would substantially impair or conflict with the Comprehensive Plan; and\n\n(iv) The project sponsor is diligently pursuing the project as shown by its planning, construction or project operational activities, its project expenditures, its efforts to secure government approvals necessary for the project, or its active participation in appeals of government decisions on its applications for government approvals. The project sponsor is not required by this paragraph (a)(1)(iv) to conduct activities that it is not legally authorized to conduct or that it demonstrates would be unreasonable for it to conduct before obtaining all necessary final government approvals.\n\n(2) Denial of extension request. Otherwise, the extension request shall be denied, and the project sponsor may apply for renewal of its approval under paragraph (b) of this section by a date to be established by the Commission. If the Commission denies the request for an extension pursuant to this section, the docket approval shall not be administratively continued automatically pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The Commission may, however, in its discretion, administratively extend the docket approval in whole or in part for a period ending on or before the date on which the Commission renders a final decision on the sponsor's re-application under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(3) Public notice. The Commission will publish notice of receipt of a request for extension under this paragraph (a) and will provide notice at least ten days prior to the date of a business meeting at which the Commissioners may act on such request.\n\n(4) Public comment. An opportunity for written comment of at least ten days' length will be provided on a request for extension. The project sponsor will be afforded an opportunity to respond in writing to the comments received. A public hearing will be provided if three or more Commission members ask the Executive Director in writing to schedule one or vote during a public meeting of the Commission to provide one.\n\n(5) Administrative continuance. A docket that is the subject of a request for extension under paragraph (a) of this section filed at least 90 days before the docket's expiration shall be administratively continued pending the Commission's final action on the request in the event that such action occurs after the otherwise effective date of termination under this section.\n\n(6) Extensions no longer needed. If the activities authorized by a docket are limited to construction activities, an extension is no longer required once construction is complete; however, the expiration of the docket, including any approved extension, does not eliminate ongoing docket obligations expressly identified as such in the docket approval.\n\n(b) Re-application (material change). If the Commission determines that the project sponsor has failed to demonstrate that no material changes to the project as approved are proposed and that the other criteria listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are satisfied, the project sponsor must apply for renewal and any necessary modification of its approval in accordance with the customary application procedure for any docket renewal or approval.\n\n(c) Automatic termination of application. Any application that remains dormant (no proof of active pursuit of approvals) for a period of three years from date of receipt, shall be automatically terminated without further action of the Commission.

The purpose of the One Permit Program set forth in this section is to provide the opportunity for the environmental agency and/or other administrative agency of a Signatory Party (“Signatory Party Agency”) and the Commission to coordinate and collaborate in the administration of a single process for the review and adjudication of projects. The One Permit Program allows the Signatory Party Agency and Commission to incorporate requirements and determinations of both entities in a single permit or other approval instrument, pursuant to a duly adopted Administrative Agreement under paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(b) Scope. This section applies to all projects that:\n\n(1) Are reviewable under the Compact;\n\n(2) Meet the thresholds for review set forth in § 401.35 of these Rules of Practice and Procedure;\n\n(3) Are subject to review by a Signatory Party Agency under its own statutory authorities; and\n\n(4) Are within regulatory programs that have been identified in a duly adopted Administrative Agreement between the Commission and a Signatory Party Agency under this section. For any project that requires an approval under the Compact that is outside the scope of the Signatory Party Agency's approval issued in accordance with an Administrative Agreement under this section, the project sponsor shall apply to the Commission in accordance with procedures established by the Commission.\n\n(c) Regulatory programs. Regulatory programs eligible for administration under the One Permit Program may include but are not limited to those concerning: Basin discharges, Basin water withdrawals, and Basin flood plain requirements.\n\n(d) Procedure. The categories of projects covered and the procedures for processing applications under the One Permit Program shall be set forth in one or more Administrative Agreements between the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency that have been adopted by the Commission following a duly noticed public hearing and are in form and substance acceptable to the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency, consistent with the following:\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section or in an Administrative Agreement that has been duly executed by the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency under this section, an application for initial approval, renewal or revision of any project subject to the One Permit Program shall be filed only with the Signatory Party Agency.\n\n(2) To enable the Commission to compile and make available to the public a current list of pending applications for projects within the Basin subject to Commission jurisdiction, the Signatory Party Agency shall notify the Commission at least monthly of applications the Signatory Party has received during the preceding month that may be eligible for review under the One Permit Program.\n\n(3) For those categories of projects identified in the Administrative Agreement as requiring Commission input, the Commission staff shall provide the Signatory Party Agency with such input, including where specified by the Administrative Agreement, a recommendation as to any conditions of approval that may be necessary or appropriate to include in the project review determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact as to those regulatory programs identified in an Administrative Agreement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(4) Unless the Signatory Party Agency disapproves the project or the Administrative Agreement provides for separate Commission action under Section 3.8 of the Compact, the Signatory Party Agency shall make the project review determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact, as specified in the Administrative Agreement, as to the regulatory program covered by the Signatory Party Agency's approval and include the determination and any associated conditions of approval within the permit or other approval instrument that it issues to the project sponsor. If in accordance with the applicable Administrative Agreement the determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact is made by the Commission, the Signatory Party Agency may include the determination together with any associated conditions of approval in its permit or other approval instrument covering the project.\n\n(5) The Commission will maintain on its Web site a list of all projects being administered pursuant to the Program.\n\n(e) Comprehensive Plan projects. Articles 11 and 13 of the Compact require certain projects to be included in the Comprehensive Plan. To add a project not yet included in the Comprehensive Plan, the project sponsor shall submit a separate application to the Commission. If following its review and public hearing the Commission approves the addition of the project to the Comprehensive Plan, the Commission's approval will include such project requirements as are necessary under the Compact and this part. All other project approvals that may be required from the Signatory Party Agency or the Commission under regulatory programs administered pursuant to this section may be issued through the One Permit Program. An application for renewal or modification of a project in the Comprehensive Plan that does not materially change the project may be submitted only to the Signatory Party Agency unless otherwise specified in the Administrative Agreement.\n\n\n\n(f) Retention of Commission review and enforcement authorities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any Commissioner or the Executive Director may designate for Commission review any project that is reviewable under the Compact. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Commission to exercise its review authority under the Compact and applicable Commission regulations. Similarly, although Administrative Agreements executed pursuant to this section may include collaborative and cooperative compliance and enforcement procedures, nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Commission to exercise its enforcement authority under the Compact and applicable regulations.\n\n(g) Exhaustion of Signatory Party administrative remedies prerequisite to appeal. Before commencing an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction challenging any final action taken by a Signatory Party Agency under this section, the appellant must first exhaust its administrative remedies under the law of the Signatory Party whose agency issued the decision at issue.\n\n(h) Fees. The Commission shall establish and maintain a schedule of fees for any or all of the services it renders pursuant to this section. The applicable fee(s) for Commission services rendered pursuant to this section shall be those set forth in DRBC Resolution No. 2009-2 (available at http://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/Res2009-2.pdf) for the review and renewal of project approvals. Project sponsors shall pay such fees, if any, directly to the Commission in accordance with the current schedule and applicable rules.\n\n(i) Effect of One Permit Program on Commission dockets. (1) Unless the Executive Director or Commission otherwise directs, if a docket holder submits, or has submitted, a timely application to a Signatory Party Agency for a project subject to review under an Administrative Agreement duly adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, the most recent docket for the project shall, upon expiration, be deemed administratively continued until final action is taken in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) Unless the Executive Director or Commission otherwise directs, upon a Signatory Party Agency's final action on an application for a project subject to the One Permit Program:\n\n(i) Any existing or administratively continued docket for such project shall terminate as to all of its provisions and conditions that pertain to regulatory programs administered by the Signatory Party Agency under the Administrative Agreement (“the Covered Programs”); and\n\n(ii) The docket shall continue in effect as to any provisions and conditions not pertaining only to Covered Programs, including, as applicable, the incorporation of the project in the Commission's Comprehensive Plan.\n\n(j) Modification of rules of practice and procedure to conform to this section. Any project subject to review under an Administrative Agreement duly adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, shall be governed by this section and not §§ 401.4, 401.5, 401.6, 401.8, 401.34(a), (c) and (e), 401.37, 401.38 and 18 CFR part 401, subpart F, where they are inconsistent with the procedures provided in this section.\n\n(k) No interference with Supreme Court decree. In accordance with Sections 3.3(a) and 3.5 of the Compact, nothing in this section shall grant the authority to any Signatory Party Agency to impair, diminish or otherwise adversely affect the diversions, compensating releases, rights, conditions, obligations and provisions for administration thereof provided in the United States Supreme Court decree in New Jersey v. New York, 347 U.S. 995 (1954) (“Decree”). Any such action shall be taken only by the Commission with the unanimous consent of the parties to the Decree or upon unanimous consent of the members of the Commission following a declaration of a state of emergency in accordance with Section 3.3(a) of the Compact.\n\n[81 FR 5587, Feb. 3, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 51826, June 20, 2024]",

Activities to be covered by the fees include the review of applications for projects that are subject to review under the Delaware River Basin Compact and implementing regulations; and ongoing activities associated with such projects, including but not limited to, effluent and ambient monitoring, data analysis, hydrodynamic and water quality modeling, and coordination with state and federal agencies.\n\n(b) Types of fees. The following types of fees are established by this section:\n\n\n\n(1) Application fee. Except as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the application fee shall apply to:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Project requiring a DRBC-issued docket or permit. Any project that, in accordance with the Delaware River Basin Compact and DRBC regulations, requires a Commission-issued docket or permit, whether it be a new or existing project for which the Commission has not yet issued an approval or a project for which the renewal of a previous Commission approval is required.\n\n(ii) Project requiring inclusion in the comprehensive plan. Any project that in accordance with section 11 or section 13.1 of the Delaware River Basin Compact and DRBC regulations must be added to the Comprehensive Plan (also, “Plan”). In addition to any new project required to be included in the Plan, such projects include existing projects that in accordance with section 13.1 of the Compact are required to be included in the Plan and which were not previously added to the Plan. Any existing project that is materially changed from the project as described in the Plan shall be deemed to be a new and different project for purposes of this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Exemptions. The application fee shall not apply to:\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) Any project for which the Signatory Party Agency serves as lead under the One Permit Program rule (§ 401.42), unless such project must be added by the Commission to the Comprehensive Plan.\n\n(B) Any project for which an agency, authority or commission of a signatory to the Compact is the primary sponsor. Projects sponsored by political subdivisions of the signatory states shall not be included in this exemption. For purposes of this section “political subdivisions” shall include without limitation municipalities, municipal utility authorities, municipal development corporations, and all other entities not directly under the budgetary and administrative control of the Commission's members.\n\n(2) Annual monitoring and coordination fee. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, an annual monitoring and coordination fee shall apply to each active water allocation or wastewater discharge approval issued pursuant to the Compact and implementing regulations in this part, regardless of whether the approval was issued by the Commission in the form of a docket, permit or other instrument, or by a Signatory Party Agency under the One Permit Program rule (§ 401.42).\n\n\n\n(ii) For any withdrawal or diversion covered in part by a certificate of entitlement issued pursuant to §§ 420.31 and 420.32 of the water supply charges regulations (18 CFR part 420), the annual monitoring and coordination fee shall be based on the allocated amount, if any, in excess of the quantity specified in the entitlement.\n\n(3) Alternative review fee. In instances where the Commission's activities and related costs associated with the review of an existing or proposed project are expected to involve extraordinary time and expense, an alternative review fee equal to the Commission's actual costs may be imposed. The Executive Director shall inform the project sponsor in writing when the alternative review fee is to be applied and may require advance payment in the amount of the Commission's projected costs. Instances in which the alternative review fee may apply include, but are not limited to, matters in which:\n\n(i) DRBC staff perform a detailed pre-application review, including but not limited to the performance or review of modeling and/or analysis to identify target limits for wastewater discharges.\n\n(ii) DRBC staff perform or review complex modeling in connection with the design of a wastewater discharge diffuser system.\n\n(iii) DRBC manages a public process for which the degree of public involvement results in extraordinary effort and expense, including but not limited to, costs associated with multiple stakeholder meetings, special public hearings, and/or voluminous public comment.\n\n(iv) DRBC conducts or is required to engage third parties to conduct additional analyses or evaluations of a project in response to a court order.\n\n(4) Additional fees—(i) Emergency approval. A request for an emergency certificate under § 401.40 to waive or amend a docket condition shall be subject to a minimum fee in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. An alternative review fee also may be charged in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.\n\n(ii) Late filed renewal application. Any renewal application submitted fewer than 180 calendar days in advance of the expiration date or after such other date specified in the docket or permit or letter of the Executive Director for filing a renewal application shall be subject to a late filed renewal application charge in excess of the otherwise applicable fee.\n\n\n\n(iii) Modification of a DRBC approval. Following Commission action on a project, any material change to the project as approved shall require an additional application and accompanying fee. Such fee shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and may be subject to an alternative review fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.\n\n\n\n(iv) Name change or change of ownership. Each project with a docket or permit issued by the DRBC will be charged an administrative fee as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section if it undergoes a change in name or a “change in ownership” as that term is defined at § 420.31(e)(2) of this subchapter.\n\n\n\n(v) Change of ownership. Each project that undergoes a “change in ownership” as that term is defined at 18 CFR 420.31(e)(2) will be charged an administrative fee as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n\n\n(c) Indexed adjustment. On July 1 of every year, beginning July 1, 2017, all fees established by this section will increase commensurate with any increase in the annual April 12-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Philadelphia, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics during that year.\n1\n In any year in which the April 12-month CPI for Philadelphia declines or shows no change, the application fee and annual monitoring and coordination fee will remain unchanged. Following any indexed adjustment made under this paragraph (c), a revised fee schedule will be published in the Federal Register by July 1 and posted on the Commission's website. Interested parties may also obtain the fee schedule by contacting the Commission directly during business hours.\n\n\n\n1 Consumer Price Index—U/Series ID: CUURA102SA0/Not Seasonally Adjusted/Area: Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-DE-MD/Item: All items/Base Period: 1982-84=100.\n(d) Late payment charge. When any fee established by this section remains unpaid 30 calendar days after the payment due date provided on the Commission's invoice, an incremental charge equal to 2% of the amount owed shall be automatically assessed. Such charge shall be assessed every 30 days thereafter until the total amount owed, including any late payment charges has been paid in full.\n\n(e) Fee schedules.

Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain policy statements and procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. In particular, all Federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. \n\n(b) Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977, amended E.O. 11514 and directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA. Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) on November 29, 1978, which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979. Section 1507.3(a) of CEQ regulations provides that each Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing procedures to supplement the regulations. Section 1507.3(b) of the CEQ NEPA regulations identifies those sections of the regulations which must be addressed in agency procedures.",

The “Responsible Federal Official (RFO)” is the official of the Federal Government designated by this rule who shall be responsible for the implementation of NEPA, including regulations issued by the CEQ (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) and the rule. Of particular importance, the RFO determines the need for an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with § 707.8 (a)(2) and (b), and if an EIS is required, files the draft and final EIS, makes the Record of Decision and assures appropriate public involvement in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6. The Chairman of the RBC's are the RFO's for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of NEPA and the P&S for those activities which are funded in whole or in part through the WRC and carried out by the RBC's, such as framework studies, special studies, comprehensive coordinated joint plans, regional or river basin (Level B) plans and revisions thereof. The Chairman of the WRC, or his designee, is the RFO for complying with the provisons of NEPA and the P&S for those framework studies, regional or river basin plans, comprehensive coordinated joint plans, and special studies which are funded by the WRC and carried out by WRC interagency committees and WRC coordinating committees; principles, standards and procedures for planning water and related land resources; rules and regulations of the WRC, and other activities of the WRC. \n\n(b) Major Federal Action. “Major Federal action” as defined in the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.18) includes actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility. Such actions include WRC interagency committee, and WRC coordinating committee adoption, approval or submittal of plans for water and related land resources. For the purpose of this rule, RBC adoption, approval or submittal of a plan for water and related land resources is considered a major Federal action by virtue of the scope and significant environmental consequences of such actions, the participation of Federal officials in these RBC actions, and the WRC requirements for Federal agency consistency with approved regional water resource management plans (WRC Policy Statement No. 4—The Utilization of Comprehensive Regional Water Resource Management Plans).",

Generally, the environmental analysis done during the development of the Environmental Quality (EQ) account under the P&S partially overlaps the analysis required in an EIS, presenting an opportunity for integration. The requirements of NEPA and the P&S will be carried out by integrating the two processes to the fullest extent practicable and by combining to the fullest extent practicable the Environmental Assessment or, when required, Environmental Impact Statement, with each study or plan into a single document that will comply fully with the requirements of both processes, as provided by the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 and 1506.4). \n\n(b) Public participation. For each environmental assessment and impact statement, the appropriate RFO will establish a specific program and schedule for public participation of all interested parties in the NEPA process, and shall otherwise provide for public involvement in accordance with the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). \n\n(c) Environmental Impact Statements. Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) as required under Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA will be prepared by river basin commissions, interagency committee, or WRC coordinating committees for comprehensive coordinated joint plans and regional or river basin (Level B) plans, or revisions thereof. The Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared concurrently with the preparation of the study or plan. The statement will reflect the level of planning involved and will address those environmental considerations and alternatives relevant to decisionmaking at that level (see § 707.9 Tiering). Review and comment on the draft study or plan and the incorporated draft environmental impact statement will be performed simultaneously, and the final combined report will incorporate and discuss the comments received on the draft.",

          "content": "§ 806.22   Standards for consumptive uses of water.\n(a) The project sponsors of all consumptive water uses subject to review and approval under § 806.4, § 806.5 or § 806.6 of this part shall comply with this section.\n\n(b) Mitigation. All project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval under § 806.4, § 806.5, § 806.6, or § 806.17 shall mitigate such consumptive use. Except to the extent that the project involves the diversion of the waters out of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the requirements of this section. Mitigation may be provided by one or a combination of the following:\n\n\n\n(1) During low flow periods as may be designated by the Commission for consumptive use mitigation.\n\n(i) Reduce withdrawal from the approved source(s), in an amount equal to the project's consumptive use, and withdraw water from alternative surface water storage or aquifers or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 45 continuous days such that impacts to nearby surface waters will not likely be at a magnitude or in a timeframe that would exacerbate present low flow conditions.\n\n(ii) Release water for flow augmentation, in an amount equal to the project's consumptive use, from surface water storage or aquifers, or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 45 continuous days such that impacts to nearby surface waters will not likely be at a magnitude or in a timeframe that would exacerbate present low flow conditions.\n\n(iii) Discontinue the project's consumptive use, which may include reduction of the project sponsor's consumptive use to less than 20,000 gpd during periods of low flow. In any case of failure to provide the specified discontinuance, such project shall provide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for the calendar year in which such failure occurs, after which the Commission will reevaluate the continued acceptability of the discontinuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Use, as a source of consumptive use water, surface storage that is subject to maintenance of a conservation release acceptable to the Commission. In any case of failure to provide the specified conservation release, such project shall provide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (3), below, for the calendar year in which such failure occurs, and the Commission will reevaluate the continued acceptability of the conservation release.\n\n(3) Provide monetary payment to the Commission, for all water consumptively used over the course of a year, in an amount and manner prescribed by the Commission.\n\n(4) Implement other alternatives approved by the Commission.\n\n(c) Determination of manner of mitigation. The Commission will, in its sole discretion, determine the acceptable manner of mitigation to be provided by project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval. Such a determination will be made after considering the project's location, source characteristics, anticipated amount of consumptive use, proposed method of mitigation and their effects on the purposes set forth in § 806.2 of this part, and any other pertinent factors. The Commission may modify, as appropriate, the manner of mitigation, including the magnitude and timing of any mitigating releases, required in a project approval.\n\n(d) Quality of water released for mitigation. The physical, chemical and biological quality of water released for mitigation shall at all times meet the quality required for the purposes listed in § 806.2, as applicable.\n\n(e) Approval by rule for consumptive uses—(1) General rule. Except with respect to projects involving hydrocarbon development subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, any project that is solely supplied water for consumptive use by public water supply, stormwater, wastewater, or other reused or recycled water, or any combination thereof, may be approved by the Executive Director under this paragraph (e) in accordance with the following, unless the Executive Director determines that the project cannot be adequately regulated under this approval by rule.\n\n(2) Notification of intent. Prior to undertaking a project or increasing a previously approved quantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall submit a notice of intent (NOI) on forms prescribed by the Commission, and the appropriate application fee, along with any required attachments.\n\n(3) Time of notice. Within 20 days after submittal of an NOI under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the project sponsor shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in § 806.15.\n\n(4) Metering, daily use monitoring, and quarterly reporting. The project sponsor shall comply with metering, daily use monitoring, and quarterly reporting as specified in § 806.30.\n\n(5) Standard conditions. The standard conditions set forth in § 806.21 shall apply to projects approved by rule.\n\n(6) Mitigation. The project sponsor shall comply with mitigation in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) or (b)(2) or (3) of this section.\n\n(7) Compliance with other laws. The project sponsor shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals required for the project from other federal, state or local government agencies having jurisdiction over the project. The Commission reserves the right to modify, suspend or revoke any approval under this paragraph (e) if the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain such approvals.\n\n(8) Decision. The Executive Director may grant, deny, suspend, revoke, modify or condition an approval to operate under this approval by rule, or renew an existing approval by rule previously granted hereunder, and will notify the project sponsor of such determination, including the quantity of consumptive use approved. Use of small capacity sources or sources used only for supply of potable water may be appropriately included as a part of this approval by rule in the discretion of the Executive Director.\n\n(9) Term. Approval by rule shall be effective upon written notification from the Executive Director to the project sponsor, shall expire 15 years from the date of such notification, and shall be deemed to rescind any previous consumptive use approvals.\n\n(f) Approval by rule for consumptive use related to unconventional natural gas and other hydrocarbon development projects. (1) Any unconventional natural gas development project subject to review and approval under § 806.4(a)(8), or any other hydrocarbon development project subject to review and approval under § 806.4, § 806.5, or § 806.6, shall be subject to review and approval by the Executive Director under this paragraph (f) regardless of the source or sources of water being used consumptively.\n\n(2) Notification of Intent: Prior to undertaking a project or increasing a previously approved quantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) on forms prescribed by the Commission, and the appropriate application fee, along with any required attachments.\n\n(3) Within 20 days after submittal of an NOI under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the project sponsor shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in § 806.15.\n\n(4) The project sponsor shall comply with metering, daily use monitoring and quarterly reporting as specified in § 806.30, or as otherwise required by the approval by rule. The project sponsor shall submit a post-hydrofracture report in a form and manner as prescribed by the Commission.\n\n(5) The project sponsor shall comply with the mitigation requirements set forth in § 806.22(b).\n\n(6) Any flowback or production fluids utilized by the project sponsor for hydrofracture stimulation undertaken at the project shall be separately accounted for, but shall not be included in the daily consumptive use amount calculated for the project, or be subject to the mitigation requirements of § 806.22(b).\n\n(7) The project sponsor shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals required for the project from other federal, state, or local government agencies having jurisdiction over the project. The Executive Director reserves the right to modify, suspend or revoke any approval under this paragraph (f) if the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain such approvals.\n\n(8) The project sponsor shall certify to the Commission that all flowback and production fluids have been re-used or treated and disposed of in accordance with applicable state and federal law.\n\n(9) The Executive Director may grant, deny, suspend, revoke, modify or condition an approval to operate under this approval by rule, or renew an existing approval by rule granted hereunder, and will notify the project sponsor of such determination, including the sources and quantity of consumptive use approved. The issuance of any approval hereunder shall not be construed to waive or exempt the project sponsor from obtaining Commission approval for any water withdrawals or diversions subject to review pursuant to § 806.4(a). Any sources of water approved pursuant to this section shall be further subject to any approval or authorization required by the member jurisdiction.\n\n(10) Approval by rule shall be effective upon issuance by the Executive Director to the project sponsor, shall expire five years from the date of such issuance, and supersede any previous consumptive use approvals to the extent applicable to the project.\n\n(11) In addition to water sources approved for use by the project sponsor pursuant to § 806.4 or this section, for unconventional natural gas development or hydrocarbon development, whichever is applicable, a project sponsor issued an approval by rule pursuant to paragraph (f)(9) of this section may utilize any of the following water sources at the drilling pad site, subject to such monitoring and reporting requirements as the Commission may prescribe:\n\n(i) Tophole water encountered during the drilling process, provided it is used only for drilling or hydrofracture stimulation.\n\n(ii) Captured stormwater, provided it is used only for drilling or hydrofracture stimulation.\n\n(iii) Drilling fluids, formation fluids, flowback or production fluids obtained from a drilling pad site, production well site or hydrocarbon water storage facility, provided it is used only for hydrofracture stimulation, and is handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards and requirements of the applicable member jurisdiction.\n\n(12) A project sponsor issued an approval by rule pursuant to paragraph (f)(9) of this section may utilize a source of water, except a public water supply, approved by the Commission pursuant to § 806.4(a) and issued to persons other than the project sponsor, provided any such source is approved for use in unconventional natural gas development, or hydrocarbon development, whichever is applicable, the project sponsor has an agreement for its use and the project sponsor registers such source with the Commission on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Commission. Use of the registered source shall not commence until the Commission acknowledges in writing that the registration is proper and complete.\n\n(13) A project sponsor issued an approval by rule pursuant to paragraph (f)(9) of this section may also utilize other sources of water, including but not limited to, water withdrawals or wastewater discharge not otherwise associated with an approval issued by the Commission pursuant to § 806.4(a), public water supplies, or another approval by rule issued pursuant to paragraph (f)(9) of this section, provided such sources are first approved by the Executive Director. Any request for approval shall be submitted on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Commission, shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in § 806.15, and shall be subject to review pursuant to the standards set forth in subpart C of this part.\n\n(14) [Reserved] \n\n(15) The project sponsor shall provide a copy of any registration or source approval issued pursuant to this section to the appropriate agency of the applicable member jurisdiction. The project sponsor shall record on a daily basis, and report quarterly on a form and in a manner prescribed by the Commission, the quantity of water obtained from any source registered or approved hereunder. Any source approval issued hereunder shall also be subject to such monitoring and reporting requirements as may be contained in such approval or otherwise required by this part.\n\n[71 FR 78579, Dec. 29, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 78620, Dec. 23, 2008; 74 FR 49812, Sept. 29, 2009; 75 FR 60621, Oct. 1, 2010; 77 FR 8099, Feb. 14, 2012; 79 FR 75430, Dec. 18, 2014; 82 FR 29393, June 29, 2017; 85 FR 16546, Mar. 24, 2020; 86 FR 52969, Sept. 24, 2021]",

The following is a non-exclusive list of actions by the Executive Director that are subject to an appeal to the Commission:\n\n(1) A determination that a project requires review and approval under § 806.5;\n\n(2) An approval or denial of an application for transfer under § 806.6;\n\n(3) An approval of a Notice of Intent under a general permit under § 806.17;\n\n(4) An approval of a minor modification under § 806.18;\n\n(5) A determination regarding an approval by rule under § 806.22(e) or (f);\n\n(6) A determination regarding an emergency certificate under § 806.34;\n\n(7) Enforcement orders issued under § 808.14;\n\n(8) A finding regarding a civil penalty under § 808.15(c);\n\n(9) A determination of grandfathered quantity under § 806.44;\n\n(10) A decision to modify, suspend or revoke a previously granted approval; and\n\n(11) A records access determination made pursuant to Commission policy.\n\n(b) The appeal shall identify the specific action or decision being appealed, the date of the action or decision, the interest of the person requesting the hearing in the subject matter of the appeal, and a statement setting forth the basis for objecting to or seeking review of the action or decision.\n\n(c) Any request not filed on or before the applicable deadline established in paragraph (a) of this section hereof will be deemed untimely and such request for a hearing shall be considered denied unless the Commission, upon written request and for good cause shown, grants leave to make such filing nunc pro tunc; the standard applicable to what constitutes good cause shown being the standard applicable in analogous cases under Federal law. Receipt of requests for hearings pursuant to this section, whether timely filed or not, shall be submitted by the Executive Director to the commissioners for their information.\n\n(d) Petitioners shall be limited to a single filing that shall set forth all matters and arguments in support thereof, including any ancillary motions or requests for relief. Issues not raised in this single filing shall be considered waived for purposes of the instant proceeding. Where the petitioner is appealing a final determination on a project application and is not the project sponsor, the petitioner shall serve a copy of the appeal upon the project sponsor within five days of its filing.\n\n(e) The Commission will determine the manner in which it will hear the appeal. If a hearing is granted, the Commission shall serve notice thereof upon the petitioner and project sponsor and shall publish such notice in the Federal Register. The hearing shall not be held less than 20 days after publication of such notice. Hearings may be conducted by one or more members of the Commission, or by such other hearing officer as the Commission may designate.\n\n(1) The petitioner may also request a stay of the action or decision giving rise to the appeal pending final disposition of the appeal, which stay may be granted or denied by the Executive Director after consultation with the Commission chair and the member from the affected member State. The decision of the Executive Director on the request for stay shall not be appealable to the Commission under this section and shall remain in full force and effect until the Commission acts on the appeal.\n\n(2) In addition to the contents of the request itself, the Executive Director, in granting or denying the request for stay, will consider the following factors:\n\n(i) Irreparable harm to the petitioner.\n\n(ii) The likelihood that the petitioner will prevail.\n\n(f) The Commission shall grant the hearing request pursuant to this section if it determines that an adequate record with regard to the action or decision is not available, or that the Commission has found that an administrative review is necessary or desirable. If the Commission denies any request for a hearing, the party seeking such hearing shall be limited to such remedies as may be provided by the compact or other applicable law or court rule. If a hearing is granted, the Commission shall refer the matter for hearing to be held in accordance with § 808.3, and appoint a hearing officer.\n\n(g) If a hearing is not granted, the Commission may set a briefing schedule and decide the appeal based on the record before it. The Commission may, in its discretion, schedule and hear oral argument on an appeal.\n\n(h)(1) A request for intervention may be filed with the Commission by persons other than the petitioner within 20 days of the publication of a notice of the granting of such hearing in the Federal Register. The request for intervention shall state the interest of the person filing such notice, and the specific grounds of objection to the action or decision or other grounds for appearance. The hearing officer(s) shall determine whether the person requesting intervention has standing in the matter that would justify their admission as an intervener to the proceedings in accordance with Federal case law.\n\n(2) Interveners shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.\n\n(i) Where a request for an appeal is made, the 90-day appeal period set forth in section 3.10 (6) and Federal reservation (o) of the compact shall not commence until the Commission has either denied the request for or taken final action on an administrative appeal.\n\n[82 FR 29396, June 29, 2017]",

(1) The hearing officer shall have the power to rule upon offers of proof and the admissibility of evidence, to regulate the course of the hearing, to set the location or venue of the hearing, to hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues and the stipulation of facts, to determine the proper parties to the hearing, to determine the scope of any discovery procedures, to delineate the hearing issues to be adjudicated, and to take notice of judicially cognizable facts and general, technical, or scientific facts. The hearing officer may, with the consent of the parties, conduct all or part of the hearing or related proceedings by telephone conference call or other electronic means.\n\n(2) The hearing officer shall cause each witness to be sworn or to make affirmation.\n\n(3) Any party to a hearing shall have the right to present evidence, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, submit rebuttal evidence, and to present summation and argument.\n\n(4) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the hearing, the hearing officer may limit the number of times any witness may testify, the repetitious examination or cross-examination of witnesses, or the extent of corroborative or cumulative testimony.\n\n(5) The hearing officer shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence, but the parties shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received provided it shall be founded upon competent, material evidence which is substantial in view of the entire record.\n\n(6) Any party may appear and be heard in person or be represented by an attorney at law who shall file an appearance with the Commission.\n\n(7) Briefs and oral argument may be required by the hearing officer and may be permitted upon request made prior to the close of the hearing by any party. They shall be part of the record unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer.\n\n(8) The hearing officer may, as he/she deems appropriate, issue subpoenas in the name of the Commission requiring the appearance of witnesses or the production of books, papers, and other documentary evidence for such hearings. \n\n(9) A record of the proceedings and evidence at each hearing shall be made by a qualified stenographer designated by the Executive Director. Where demanded by the petitioner, or any other person who is a party to the appeal proceedings, or where deemed necessary by the Hearing Officer, the testimony shall be transcribed. In those instances where a transcript of proceedings is made, two copies shall be delivered to the Commission. The petitioner or other persons who desire copies shall obtain them from the stenographer at such price as may be agreed upon by the stenographer and the person desiring the transcript.\n\n(c) Staff and other expert testimony. The Executive Director shall arrange for the presentation of testimony by the Commission's technical staff and other experts, as he/she may deem necessary or desirable, to be incorporated in the record to support the administrative action, determination or decision which is the subject of the hearing.\n\n(d) Written testimony. If the direct testimony of an expert witness is expected to be lengthy or of a complex, technical nature, the presiding officer may order that such direct testimony be submitted to the Commission in sworn, written form. Copies of said testimony shall be served upon all parties appearing at the hearing at least 10 days prior to said hearing. Such written testimony, however, shall not be admitted whenever the witness is not present and available for cross-examination at the hearing unless all parties have waived the right of cross-examination.\n\n(e) Assessment of costs. (1) Whenever a hearing is conducted, the costs thereof, as herein defined, shall be assessed by the presiding officer to the petitioner or such other party as the hearing officer deems equitable. For the purposes of this section, costs include all incremental costs incurred by the Commission, including, but not limited to, hearing officer and expert consultants reasonably necessary in the matter, stenographic record, rental of the hall and other related expenses.\n\n(2) Upon the scheduling of a matter for hearing, the hearing officer shall furnish to the petitioner a reasonable estimate of the costs to be incurred under this section. The project sponsor may be required to furnish security for such costs either by cash deposit or by a surety bond of a corporate surety authorized to do business in a member state.\n\n(3) A party to an appeal under this section who desires to proceed in forma pauperis shall submit an affidavit to the Commission requesting the same and showing in detail the assets possessed by the party, and other information indicating the reasons why that party is unable to pay costs incurred under this section or to give security for such costs. The Commission may grant or refuse the request based upon the contents of the affidavit or other factors, such as whether it believes the appeal or intervention is taken in good faith.\n\n(f) Findings and report. The hearing officer shall prepare a report of his/her findings and recommendations based on the record of the hearing. The report shall be served by personal service or certified mail (return receipt requested) upon each party to the hearing or its counsel. Any party may file objections to the report. Such objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on all parties within 20 days after the service of the report. A brief shall be filed together with objections. Any replies to the objections shall be filed and served on all parties within 10 days of service of the objections. Prior to its decision on such objections, the Commission may grant a request for oral argument upon such filing.\n\n(g) Action by the Commission. The Commission will act upon the findings and recommendations of the presiding officer pursuant to law. The determination of the Commission will be in writing and shall be filed in Commission records together with any transcript of the hearing, report of the hearing officer, objections thereto, and all plans, maps, exhibits and other papers, records or documents relating to the hearing.",

TVA's Guide to Information, which may be accessed on the TVA Web site at https://www.tva.com/Information/Freedom-of-Information/A-Guide-to-Information-About-The-Tennessee-Valley-Authority may be helpful in making your request.\n\n(2) If you are making a request about yourself, see subpart B Privacy Act for additional requirements.\n\n(3) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, TVA may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable TVA personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help TVA identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the TVA's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the agency determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency shall inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the agency's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.\n\n(c) Format of records sought. Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. TVA will accommodate your request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.\n\n(d) Requester contact information. Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the agency in communicating with them and providing released records.",

A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. TVA's FOIA Officer or the FOIA Officer's designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by TVA.\n\n(c) Consultation, referral and coordination. When reviewing records located by TVA in response to a request, TVA will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, TVA shall proceed in one of the following ways:\n\n(1) Consultation. When records originated with the agency processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the agency processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.\n\n(2) Referral. (i) When the agency processing the request believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the agency typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the agency processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n\n(ii) Whenever an agency refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.\n\n(3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the agency that received the request should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.\n\n(d) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the agency must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving agency must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the agency must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(e) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by TVA will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.\n\n(f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. TVA may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.",

          "content": "§ 1301.5   Timing of responses to requests.\n(a) In general. TVA ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt and placement in an appropriate processing track as follows.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. TVA has established three tracks for handling requests and the track to which a request is assigned will depend on the nature of the request and the estimated processing time. Among the factors TVA may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. TVA will also designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. TVA will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.\n\n(1) Track 1. Requests that can be answered with readily available records or information. These are the fastest to process. These requests ordinarily will be responded to within 20 working days of receipt of a proper request by the FOIA Officer. The 20 working day time limit provided in this paragraph may be extended by TVA for unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, upon written notice to the person requesting the records.\n\n(2) Track 2. Requests where we need records or information from other offices throughout TVA, where we must consult with other Government agencies, or when we must process a submitter notice as described in § 1301.8(d), but we do not expect that the decision on disclosure will be as time consuming as for requests in Track 3.\n\n(3) Track 3. Requests which require a decision or input from another office or agency, extensive submitter notifications because of the presence of Business Information as defined in § 1301.8(b)(1), and a considerable amount of time will be needed for that, or the request is complicated or involves a large number of records. Usually, these requests will take the longest to process.\n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” and TVA extends the time limit on that basis, TVA will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which TVA estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, TVA will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at https://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html. TVA will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonable necessary to the proper processing of the particular requests:\n\n(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;\n\n(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or\n\n(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.\n\n(d) Aggregating requests. To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, TVA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. TVA cannot aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.\n\n(e) Expedited processing. (1) TVA will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;\n\n(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.\n\n(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. For a prompt determination, requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section should be submitted to the TVA FOIA Officer. Requests based on paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section should be submitted in accordance with the agency's requirements as described in § 1301.3. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the TVA Chief FOIA Officer and Appeals Official.\n\n(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, TVA may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(4) TVA will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the agency must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.",

TVA, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the Internet electronically, such as email.\n\n(b) Acknowledgments of requests. TVA will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. TVA will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.\n\n(c) Estimated dates of completion and interim responses. Upon request, TVA will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, TVA may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.\n\n(d) Grants of requests. Once TVA determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. TVA will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1301.11 of this subpart and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.\n\n(e) Adverse determinations of requests. If TVA makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing. In the event of an adverse determination, TVA will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance to requesters.\n\n(f) Content of denial. The denial must be signed by the head of the agency or their designee and must include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1301.9(a) of this subpart, and a description of the appeal requirements.\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.\n\n(g) Markings on released documents. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(h) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that TVA identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), TVA will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy, to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) If an exclusion is invoked, TVA will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.",

Such records include bids and information concerning the identity and number of bids received prior to bid opening and award; and all negotiations in progress involving contracts or agreements for the acquisition or disposal of real or personal property by TVA prior to the conclusion of such negotiations.

A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.\n\n(c) When notice to submitters is required. (1) TVA will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if TVA determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) TVA has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.\n\n(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the agency may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.\n\n(d) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:\n\n(1) TVA determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, TVA will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) TVA will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.\n\n(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide TVA a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.\n\n(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. TVA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(f) Analysis of objections. TVA will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever TVA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, TVA will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as TVA intends to release them; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice.\n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit.

Summit Hill Drive (WT 7C), Knoxville, TN 37902-1401. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked within 90 calendar days after the date of the initial response. The appeal should clearly identify the agency determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The TVA Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official or designee will act on all appeals under this section.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.\n\n(c) Decisions on appeals.

          "content": "§ 1301.11   Fees.\n(a) In general. (1) TVA will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:\n\n(i) Commercial use requesters;\n\n(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and\n\n(iii) All other requesters.\n\n(2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. TVA will consider requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, TVA may contact a requester for additional information. TVA will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. TVA ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Tennessee Valley Authority, or by another method as determined by TVA.\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. TVA's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. TVA will notify requesters of their placement in this category.\n\n(2) Direct costs are those expenses that TVA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.\n\n(3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. TVA may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\n\nExample 1.A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.\n\nExample 2.A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.\n\nExample 3.A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.\n(5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\n(6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\n(7) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(8) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1301.7 of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, TVA will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, agencies should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. TVA will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: For time spent by clerical employees, the charge is $14.90 per hour. For time spent by supervisory and professional employees, the charge is $34.30 per hour.\n\n(iii) TVA will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. TVA must notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.\n\n(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by TVA at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), TVA will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Duplication. TVA will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where TVA can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, TVA will provide one copy per request at the cost of 10 cents per page for sheets no larger than 8\n1/2 by 14 inches. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, TVA will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, TVA will charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. TVA will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by TVA to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with an agency's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) When TVA determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.\n\n(2)(i) If TVA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in responding to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.\n\n(ii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.\n\n(iii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, TVA may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. TVA must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and TVA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, TVA may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.\n\n(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, TVA must provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When TVA determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, TVA will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, TVA will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) If TVA notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. TVA is not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but TVA estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, TVA will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. TVA will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if TVA chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(g) Charging interest. TVA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by TVA. TVA must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(h) Aggregating requests. When TVA reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, TVA may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. TVA may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, TVA will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.\n\n(i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, TVA cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When TVA determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. TVA may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, TVA may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and TVA may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before TVA begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where TVA has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which TVA requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of TVA's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n\n(j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, TVA will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.\n\n(k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) TVA will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:\n\n(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. TVA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, TVA will consider the following criteria:\n\n(A) TVA must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, TVA must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. TVA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.\n\n(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to TVA and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.",

They provide procedures by which an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Act to determine whether a TVA system contains a record pertaining to him; to gain access to such records; to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof; and to request administrative correction or amendment of such records. They prescribe fees to be charged for copying records; establish identification requirements; list penalties provided by statute for certain violations of the Act; and establish exemptions from certain requirements of the Act for certain TVA systems or components thereof. \n\n(b) Nothing in §§ 1301.21 to 1301.34 entitles an individual to any access to any information or record compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. \n\n(c) Certain records of which TVA may have physical possession are the official records of another government agency which exercises dominion and control over the records, their content, and access thereto. In such cases, TVA's maintenance of the records is subject to the direction of the other government agency. Except for a request for a determination of the existence of the record, when TVA receives requests related to these records, TVA will immediately refer the request to the controlling agency for all decisions regarding the request, and will notify the individual making the request of the referral. \n\n\n\n[40 FR 45313, Oct. 1, 1975.

A request for determination may be combined with a request for access. \n\n(b) Requests under this section shall: \n\n(1) Be in writing and signed by the individual seeking the determination or access; \n\n(2) Include the individual's mailing address; \n\n(3) Name the TVA system as listed in the TVA system notice; \n\n(4) Include any additional identifying information specified in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the applicable TVA system notice; \n\n(5) Specify whether the request is for determination only or for both determination and access; and \n\n(6) Include such proof of identity as may be required by § 1301.24 and the applicable system notice. Requests may be presented in person or by mail. In-person requests shall be presented during normal TVA business hours, as set out in § 1301.24(g). \n\n(c) Requests for determination only shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Requests for both determination and access shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Access procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Certain TVA system notices designate officials at field locations of TVA systems. With respect to such TVA systems, an individual who believes his record is located at the field location may present a request to the designated official at the field location. If the record is not available at that field location, the request will be forwarded to the appropriate TVA office. \n\n(d) If a request is for determination only, the determination will normally be made within 10 days after receipt of the request. If the determination cannot be made within 10 days after receipt of a request, the designated official will acknowledge the request in writing and state when the determination will be made. Upon making a determination, the designated official will notify the individual making the request whether the record exists. The notice will include any additional information necessary to enable the individual to request access to the record. \n\n(e) A request which includes a request for access will be acknowledged within 10 days after receipt. If access can be granted as requested, the acknowledgment will provide a time and place for disclosure of the requested record. Disclosure will normally be made within 30 days of the date of the acknowledgement, but the designated official may extend the 30-day period for reasons found by him to be good cause. In case of an extension, TVA will notify the individual, in writing, that disclosure will be delayed, the reasons for delay, and the anticipated date on which the individual may expect the record to be disclosed. TVA will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests for disclosure at specified times and dates, as set forth in a request for access, so far as compatible with the conduct of TVA business. \n\n\n\n[40 FR 45313, Oct. 1, 1975.

A comparison of the signature of the requester with either the signature on the card or a signature in the record may be used to confirm identity. \n\n(c) Because of the sensitivity of the subject matter in a TVA system, a TVA system notice may prescribe special identification requirements for the disclosure of the existence of or access to records in that TVA system. In such case, the special identification requirements prescribed in the TVA system notice shall apply in lieu of those prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section. \n\n(d) If TVA deems it warranted by the nature of identification presented, the subject matter of the material to be disclosed, or other reasons found by TVA to be sufficient, TVA may require the individual requesting access to sign a statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. \n\n(e) Where TVA is requested to provide access to records by mailing copies of records to the requester, the request shall contain or be accompanied by adequate identifying information to make it likely the requester is the person he purports to be and a notarized statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. \n\n(f) Where sensitivity of record information may warrant (i.e., unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual) or disclosure by mail to third persons is requested, TVA may require in-person confirmation of identity. If in-person confirmation of identity is required, the individual may arrange with the designated TVA official to provide such identification at any of these TVA locations convenient to the individual: Knoxville, Nashville, and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Muscle Shoals, Alabama; Washington, DC, or another location agreed upon by the individual and the designated TVA official.

An appeal must be taken within 20 days of receipt of notice of TVA's initial refusal to amend the record and is taken by delivering a written notice of appeal to the Privacy Act Reviewing Official, Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902-1401. Such notice shall be signed by the appellant and shall state: \n\n(1) That it is an appeal from a denial of a request to amend the individual's records under these regulations and under the Privacy Act of 1974; \n\n(2) The reasons why the appellant believes the denial to have been erroneous; \n\n(3) The date on which the denial was issued; and \n\n(4) The date on which the denial was received by the appellant. \n\n(b) Appeals shall be determined by a reviewing official. Such determination may be based on information provided for the initial determination; any additional information which TVA or the appellant may desire to provide; and any other material the reviewing official deems relevant to the determination. The reviewing official, in his sole discretion, may request TVA or the appellant to provide additional information deemed relevant to the appeal. The appellant will be given an opportunity to respond to any information provided by TVA or independently procured by the reviewing official. If in the sole discretion of the reviewing official a hearing is deemed necessary for resolution of the appeal, the reviewing official may conduct a hearing upon notice to TVA and the appellant, at which both TVA and the appellant shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the appeal. The rules governing any hearing will be set forth in the notice of hearing. \n\n(c) The reviewing official shall make final determination on the appeal within 30 days after it is received unless such period is extended for good cause. If the reviewing official finds good cause for an extension, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of the reason for the delay and of the approximate date on which the reviewing official expects to complete his determination of the appeal. \n\n(d) If the reviewing official determines that a record should be amended in whole or in part in accordance with an appellant's request, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of its determination and correct or amend the record. If an accounting of disclosures has been made, TVA will, to the extent of the accounting, inform prior recipients of the record of the fact that the correction was made and of the substance of the correction. \n\n(e) If the reviewing official determines not to amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with a request, TVA will advise the individual: \n\n(1) Of its refusal to amend and the reasons therefor; \n\n(2) Of the appellant's right to file a concise statement of reasons for disagreement with the refusal as set out in paragraph (f) of this section; \n\n(3) Of the procedures for filing a statement of disagreement; \n\n(4) That any statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with any statement by TVA summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record; \n\n(5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained; and \n\n(6) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to amend a record. \n\n(f) If the reviewing official's final determination of an appeal is a refusal to correct or amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with the request, the appellant may file with TVA a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of TVA to amend the records. Such statements normally should not exceed 100 words. A statement of disagreement should be submitted within 30 days of receipt of notice of the reviewing official's decision on the appeal, and should be sent to system manager. In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement which occurs after the filing of the statement, TVA will clearly note any portion of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement with the disclosure. Copies of the statement will also be furnished to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was made. TVA may attach to the statement of disagreement a brief summary of TVA's reasons for refusing to amend the record. Such summaries will be disclosed to the individual, but are not subject to amendment. \n\n[40 FR 45313, Oct. 1, 1975.

This exemption is pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(5) and (6).\n\n(b)(1) The TVA systems “Apprentice Training Record System-TVA,” “Consultant and Contractor Records-TVA,” “Employment Applicant Files-TVA,” “Personnel Files-TVA,” and “Nuclear Quality Assurance Personnel Records-TVA” are exempted from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and corresponding sections of these rules to the extent that disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

The General Counsel shall consider the following factors, among others, in deciding whether requested testimony or materials must be withheld:\n\n(1) Whether production is appropriate in light of any relevant privilege;\n\n(2) Whether production is appropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the procedures governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;\n\n(3) Whether the material requested is relevant to the matter at issue;\n\n(4) Whether allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;\n\n(5) Whether disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order, or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a;\n\n(6) Whether disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights or national security interests;\n\n(7) Whether disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets or proprietary confidential information without the owner's consent;\n\n(8) Whether disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of TVA's functions;\n\n(9) Whether the records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;\n\n(10) Whether disclosure would result in TVA appearing to favor one litigant over another;\n\n(11) Whether the demand or request is within the authority of the party making it; and\n\n(12) Whether a substantial Government interest is implicated.\n\n(d) Restrictions on testimony or production of records or official information.

In particular, section 26a of the Act requires that TVA's approval be obtained prior to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any dam, appurtenant works, or other obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations along or in the Tennessee River or any of its tributaries. By way of example only, such obstructions may include boat docks, piers, boathouses, buoys, floats, boat launching ramps, fills, water intakes, devices for discharging effluent, bridges, aerial cables, culverts, pipelines, fish attractors, shoreline stabilization projects, channel excavations, and floating cabins as described in § 1304.101. Any person considering constructing, operating, or maintaining any such obstruction on a stream in the Tennessee River Watershed should carefully review the regulations in this part and the 26a Applicant's Package before doing so. The regulations also apply to certain activities on TVA-owned land alongside TVA reservoirs and to land subject to TVA flowage easements. TVA uses and permits use of the lands and land rights in its custody alongside and subjacent to TVA reservoirs and exercises its land rights to carry out the purposes and policies of the Act. In addition, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., have declared it to be congressional policy that agencies should administer their statutory authorities so as to restore, preserve, and enhance the quality of the environment and should cooperate in the control of pollution. It is the intent of the regulations in this part 1304 to carry out the purposes of the Act and other statutes relating to these purposes, and this part shall be interpreted and applied to that end. \n\n\n\n[68 FR 46936, Aug. 7, 2003, as amended at 83 FR 44472, Aug. 31, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1304.2   Application.\n(a) If the facility is to be built on TVA land, the applicant must, in addition to the other requirements of this part, own the fee interest in or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest of sufficient tenure to cover the normal useful life of the proposed facility in land immediately adjoining the TVA land. If the facility is to be built on private land, the applicant must own the fee interest in the land or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest in the property where the facility will be located. If the facility is an existing floating cabin, it must meet the requirements of subpart B. TVA recognizes, however, that in some cases private property has been subdivided in a way that left an intervening strip of land between the upland boundary of a TVA flowage easement and the waters of the reservoir, or did not convey to the adjoining landowner the land underlying the waters of the reservoir. In some of these situations, the owner of the intervening strip or underlying land cannot be identified or does not object to construction of water-use facilities by the adjacent landowner. In these situations, TVA may exercise its discretion to permit the facility, provided there is no objection from the fee owner of the intervening strip or underlying land. A TVA permit conveys no property interest. The applicant is responsible for locating the proposed facility on qualifying land and ensuring that there is no objection from any owner of such land. TVA may require the applicant to provide appropriate verification of ownership and lack of objection, but TVA is not responsible for resolving ownership questions. In case of a dispute, TVA may require private parties requesting TVA action to grant or revoke a TVA permit to obtain a court order declaring respective ownership and/or land rights. TVA may exercise its discretion to permit a facility on TVA land that is located up or downstream from the land which makes the applicant eligible for consideration to receive a permit.\n\n\n\n(b) Applications shall be submitted on TVA's online application system or addressed to the Tennessee Valley Authority, at the appropriate location as listed on the application and on TVA's website. \n\n To contact an office, call 1-800-882-5263 or email plic@tva.gov. Applications are available on TVA's website.\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Submittal of section 26a application. Applicants must submit certain required information depending upon whether a proposed facility is a minor or major facility. Examples of the two categories are provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Most residential related facilities are minor facilities. Commercial or community facilities generally are major facilities. TVA shall determine whether a proposed facility is minor or major. An application shall not be complete until payment of the appropriate fee as determined in accordance with 18 CFR part 1310, and disclosed to the applicant in the materials provided with the application package or by such other means of disclosure as TVA shall from time to time adopt. For purposes of the information required to be submitted under this section and the determination of fees, a request for a variance to the size limitations for a residential-related facility (other than a waiver request under § 1304.212 or § 1304.300(a)) shall be regarded as an application for a major facility. In addition to the information required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, TVA may require the applicant to provide such other information as TVA deems necessary for adequate review of a particular application. \n\n(1) Information required for review of minor facility. By way of example only, minor facilities may include: boat docks, piers, rafts, boathouses, fences, steps, gazebos, and floating cabins. One copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions included in the section 26a Applicant's Package. The application shall include: \n\n\n\n(i) Completed application form. One copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted. Application forms are available on TVA's website. The application shall include a project description which indicates what is to be built, removed, or modified, and the sequence of the work. Applications for floating cabins shall include written evidence that the floating cabin was located or moored on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, and detailed descriptions of mooring method, how electrical service is provided, and how wastewater is managed. An application to relocate a floating cabin to a marina shall include evidence of approval from the accepting marina operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Project, plan, or drawing. The project plan/drawing shall: \n\n\n\n(A) Be prepared electronically or on paper suitable for reproduction (no larger than 11 by 17 inches).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Identify the kind of structure, purpose/intended use; \n\n(C) Show principal dimensions, size, and location in relation to shoreline; \n\n(D) Show the elevation of the structure above the full summer pool; and \n\n(E) Indicate the river or reservoir name, river mile, locator landmarks, and direction of water flow if known. \n\n(iii) A site photograph. The photograph shall be at least 3 by 5 inches in size and show the location of the proposed structure or alteration and the adjacent shoreline area. \n\n(iv) Location map. The location map shall clearly show the location of the proposed facility and the extent of any site disturbance for the proposed project. An 8\n1/2 by 11-inch copy of one of the following is ideal: a TVA land map, a subdivision map, or a portion of a United States Geological Survey topographic map. The subdivision name and lot number and the map number or name shall be included, if available. \n\n(v) Environmental consultations and permits. To the fullest extent possible the applicant shall obtain or apply for other required environmental permits and approvals before or at the same time as applying for section 26a approvals. Consultations under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall take place, and permits from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and State agencies for water or air regulation shall be obtained or applied for at the same time as or before application for section 26a approval. The applicant shall provide TVA with copies of any such permits or approvals that are issued. \n\n(2) Information required for a major facility. One (1) copy of the application shall be prepared and submitted according to instructions included in the section 26a Applicant's Package. By way of example only, major projects and facilities may include: marinas, community docks, barge terminals, utility crossings, bridges, culverts, roads, wastewater discharges, water intakes, dredging, and placement of fill. The application shall include:\n\n(i) Completed application form. Application forms are available on TVA's website. The application shall include a narrative project description which indicates what is to be built, removed, or modified, and the sequence of the work. \n\n(ii) Project plan or drawing. Adequate project plans or drawings shall accompany the application. They shall: \n\n\n\n(A) Be prepared electronically or on paper suitable for reproduction (no larger than 11 by 17 inches).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(B) Contain the date; applicant name; stream; river or reservoir name; river mile; locator landmarks; and direction of water flow, if known;\n\n(C) Identify the kind of structure, purpose/intended use; \n\n(D) Include a plan and profile view of the structure; \n\n(E) Show principal dimensions, size, and location in relation to shoreline; \n\n(F) Show the elevations of the structure above full summer pool if located on a TVA reservoir or above the normal high water elevation if on a free-flowing stream or river; and \n\n(G) Show the north arrow. \n\n(iii) Location map. The location map must clearly indicate the exact location and extent of site disturbance for the proposed project. An 8\n1/2- by 11-inch copy of the appropriate portion of a United States Geological Survey topographic map is recommended. The map number or name shall be included. In addition, recent photos of the location are helpful for TVA's review and may be included. \n\n(iv) Other information where applicable. The location of any material laydown or assembly areas, staging areas, equipment storage areas, new access roads, and road/access closure required by the project or needed for construction; the location of borrow or spoil areas on or off TVA land; the extent of soil and vegetative disturbance; and information on any special reservoir operations needed for the project, such as drawdown or water discharge restrictions. \n\n(v) Site plans. Some projects, particularly larger ones, may require a separate site plan which details existing and proposed changes to surface topography and elevations (cut and fill, clearing, etc.), location of all proposed facilities, and erosion control plans. \n\n(vi) Environmental consultations and permits. To the fullest extent possible the applicant shall obtain or apply for other required environmental permits and approvals before or at the same time as applying for section 26a approvals. Consultations under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall take place, and permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and State agencies for water or air regulation shall be obtained or applied for at the same time as or before application for section 26a approval. The applicant shall provide TVA with copies of any such permits or approvals that are issued. TVA, in its sole discretion, may proceed with the review of an application in the absence of some materials listed in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Discharges into navigable waters of the United States. If construction, maintenance, or operation of the proposed structure or any part thereof, or the conduct of the activity in connection with which approval is sought may result in any discharge into navigable waters of the United States, applicant shall also submit with the application, in addition to the material required by paragraph (c) of this section, a copy of the request for certification from the state in which such discharge would originate, or if appropriate, from the interstate water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over the navigable waters at the point where the discharge would originate, or from the Environmental Protection Agency, that such state or interstate agency or the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that the applicant's proposed activity will be conducted in a manner that will comply with applicable water quality standards. The applicant shall further submit such supplemental and additional information as TVA may deem necessary for the review of the application, including, without limitation, information concerning the amounts, chemical makeup, temperature differentials, type and quantity of suspended solids, and proposed treatment plans for any proposed discharges. No section 26a permit will be granted until required certification has been obtained or has been waived. If a certifying agency has not acted within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, of an applicant's request for certification from the respective agency and certification is waived, TVA will proceed with processing of the section 26a permit application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) TVA's issuance of a permit does not mean that TVA has determined a facility or obstruction is safe for any purpose or that TVA has any duty to make such a determination. In issuing a permit, TVA assumes no liability to the applicant or to any third party for any damages to property or personal injuries arising out of or in any way connected with applicant's construction, operation, or maintenance of the permitted facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[68 FR 46936, Aug. 7, 2003, as amended at 79 FR 4621, Jan. 29, 2014; 86 FR 50632, Sept. 10, 2021; 89 FR 104881, Dec. 26, 2024] \n\n\nEffective Date Note:At 68 FR 46936, Aug. 7, 2003, § 1304.2 was revised.

Floating cabins as applied to this subpart include existing nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA and other existing structures, whose design and use is primarily for human habitation or occupation and not for navigation or transportation on the water. Floating cabins that were not located or moored on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed new floating cabins. New floating cabins are prohibited and subject to the removal provisions of this part and Section 9b of the TVA Act. No new floating cabins shall be moored, anchored, or installed on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins that were located or moored in the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed existing floating cabins. Existing floating cabins may remain moored on the Tennessee River System provided they remain in compliance with the rules in this part and obtain a section 26a permit from TVA issued after October 12, 2021. Existing floating cabins that do not apply for a permit by the deadline in this part or do not remain in compliance with the rules in this part are subject to the removal provisions of this part and section 9b of the TVA Act. All permits for nonnavigable houseboats or floating cabins that were not located on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, are terminated.

          "content": "§ 1304.101   Floating cabins.\n(a)(1) Floating cabins include nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA as of December 16, 2016, and other floating structures moored on the Tennessee River System as of this date and determined by TVA in its sole discretion to be designed and used primarily for human habitation or occupation and not designed and used primarily for navigation or transportation on the water as of December 16, 2016. If, at any time, the floating cabin is modified such that it no longer meets the criteria to be deemed a floating cabin, the approval for that existing floating cabin will be terminated. TVA's judgment will be guided by, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\n(i) Whether the structure is usually kept at a fixed mooring point;\n\n(ii) Whether the structure is actually used on a regular basis for transportation or navigation;\n\n(iii) Whether the structure has a permanent or continuous connection to the shore for electrical, plumbing, water, or other utility service;\n\n(iv) Whether the structure has the performance characteristics of a vessel typically used for navigation or transportation on water;\n\n(v) Whether the structure can be readily removed from the water;\n\n(vi) Whether the structure is used for intermittent or extended human-habitation or occupancy;\n\n(vii) Whether the structure clearly has a means of propulsion, and appropriate power/size ratio;\n\n(viii) Whether the structure is safe to navigate or use for transportation purposes.\n\n(2) That a structure could occasionally move from place to place, or that it qualifies under another federal or state regulatory program as a vessel or boat, are factors that TVA also will consider but would not be determinative. Floating cabins are not recreational vessels to which § 1304.409 applies.\n\n(b) Owners of floating cabins are required to register the floating cabin with TVA by January 10, 2022. Floating cabin owners shall include the following information with their registration: Clear and current photographs of the structure; a drawing or drawings showing in reasonable detail the size and shape of the floating cabin (length, width, and height) and attached structures, such as decks or slips (length, width, and height); and a completed and signed TVA registration form. The completed TVA registration form shall include the mailing and contact information of the owner(s); the TVA permit or TVA-issued numbers (when applicable); the mooring location of the floating cabin; how the floating cabin is moored; how electrical service is provided; how wastewater and sewage are managed; and an owner's signature.\n\n(c) All floating cabins shall comply with the rules contained in this part and make application for a section 26a permit by October 1, 2029. TVA may, at its sole discretion, deny an initial application for a floating cabin submitted after this date. Unpermitted structures are subject to the removal provisions of this part and section 9b of the TVA Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Existing floating cabins may remain on the Tennessee River System provided they stay in compliance with the rules contained in this part and pay any necessary and reasonable fees levied by TVA to ensure compliance with TVA's regulations, in accordance with section 9b of the TVA Act.\n\n(e) Existing floating cabins must be moored at one of the following locations:\n\n(1) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin is the owner or lessee (or the licensee of such owner or lessee) of the proposed mooring location provided the floating cabin was moored at such location as of December 16, 2016;\n\n(2) At locations described by § 1304.201(a)(1), (2), and (3) provided the floating cabin was moored at such location as of December 16, 2016;\n\n(3) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin obtained written approval from TVA pursuant to subpart A of this part authorizing mooring at such location as of December 16, 2016; or\n\n(4) Within the designated and approved harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. As provided in § 1304.404, TVA may adjust harbor limits and require relocation of an existing floating cabin within the harbor limits.\n\n(f) Applications for mooring of a floating cabin outside of designated harbor limits will be disapproved if TVA determines that the proposed mooring location would be contrary to the intent of this subpart.\n\n(g) A floating cabin moored at a location approved pursuant to this subpart shall not be relocated and moored at a different location without a permit from TVA, except for movement to a new location within the designated harbor limits of the same commercial marina. Existing floating cabins may only relocate to the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404 on the same reservoir where the floating cabin was moored as of December 16, 2016. Relocation of a floating cabin to another TVA reservoir is prohibited.\n\n(h)(1) Existing floating cabins shall be maintained in a good state of repair and may be maintained without additional approval from TVA. By way of example, these activities may include painting, changing the internal walls within the existing enclosed space, replacing the shingles, siding, electrical wiring, or plumbing, or adding new flotation in compliance with § 1304.400. Repair and maintenance activities shall not modify the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the floating cabin, any external walls, or the enclosed or open space.\n\n(2) Any alterations to the dimensions or approved plans for an existing floating cabin (monolithic frame or attached structure) shall be deemed a structural modification and shall require prior written approval from TVA. All expansions in length, width, or height are prohibited, except under the following circumstances if approved in writing in advance by TVA. Structural modifications to attached structures are subject to § 1304.101(i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) TVA may allow alterations necessary to comply with health, safety, and environmental standards;\n\n(ii) TVA may allow changes in roof pitch or allow open portions of the monolithic frame to be covered, but no part of the floating cabin may exceed a total height of 14 feet above the lowest floor level; or\n\n(iii) TVA may allow enclosure of existing open space on the monolithic frame of the existing floating cabin if the enclosure will not result in expansion to the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the monolithic frame, subject to § 1304.101(i). At least 24 contiguous square feet of open space with a minimum width of four feet shall be maintained on the monolithic frame for unrestricted boarding.\n\n(3) Owners must submit an application to TVA sixty (60) days in advance of proposed rebuilding of an entire or significant portion of a floating cabin (monolithic frame or attached structures). The owner shall not begin construction until prior written acknowledgment from TVA is received. Plans for removal of the existing floating cabin or portions to be rebuilt shall be acknowledged in writing by TVA before removal occurs, and the removal shall be at the owner's expense before construction of the rebuild may begin. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator to rebuild within the approved harbor limits of a commercial marina. TVA may require a new permit for the proposed rebuilding. Construction of the rebuilt floating cabin must be completed within 18 months. The rebuilt monolithic frame of the floating cabin shall match the exact configuration and dimensions (length, width, and height) of both the total monolithic frame and the enclosed and open space as approved by TVA; attached structures are subject to § 1304.101(i). The footprint of the attached structures shall not be incorporated into the footprint of the monolithic frame of the floating cabin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) TVA may allow the exchange of multiple existing floating cabins removed from the Tennessee River System for a single combined floating cabin under the following conditions:\n\n(i) Prior written approval from TVA shall be obtained before taking any actions. Evidence shall be provided to TVA that all existing floating cabins to be exchanged were located on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016.\n\n(ii) Plans for removal of the existing floating cabin(s) shall be approved in writing by TVA before removal occurs, and the floating cabin(s) shall be removed at the owner's expense before construction of the new combined floating cabin may begin. Approvals of the existing floating cabins to be exchanged will be terminated. Construction on the new combined floating cabin must be completed within 18 months.\n\n(iii) The combined floating cabin shall be moored within the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator to locate within the marina. The combined floating cabin must be located on the same reservoir as any of the existing floating cabins to be exchanged.\n\n(iv) The maximum total size of the monolithic frame of the combined floating cabin is 1,000 square feet or the sum of the square footage of the monolithic frames of the existing exchanged floating cabins, whichever is less. At least 24 contiguous square feet with a minimum width of four feet must remain open to allow for unrestricted boarding of the combined floating cabin. Any square footage of the existing exchanged floating cabins that exceeds the maximum allowable total size of the combined floating cabin is not transferrable to other projects or owners.\n\n(v) The maximum height of any part of the combined floating cabin is 14 feet above the lowest floor level.\n\n(vi) Floating attached structures, such as decks or platforms, are subject to § 1304.101(i).\n\n(i) With written approval from TVA, floating cabins may be accompanied by floating attached structures subject to the following:\n\n(1) A single floating cabin may have multiple floating attached structures. The footprint of each attached structure will be measured as a rectangular or square area. The total footprint of all attached structures for a single floating cabin cannot exceed 400 square feet or the total footprint of the existing attached structures that were part of the floating cabin as of December 16, 2016, whichever is greater.\n\n(2) The footprint of the attached structures shall not be incorporated into the footprint of the monolithic frame of the floating cabin.\n\n(3) Attached structures shall not exceed 14 feet in height from the lowest floor level, shall not be enclosed, shall not be connected to the monolithic frame by a single roofline, and shall comply with § 1304.204(p).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) All attached structures must be permitted to the floating cabin owner. The owner shall provide evidence of approval from the marina operator for the attached structures.\n\n(5) Existing attached structures that were part of the floating cabin as of December 16, 2016, may remain with written approval from TVA. Any requests to rebuild or reconfigure attached structures must comply with § 1304.101(i)(1) through (4). Attached structures associated with a request for a structural modification as described in § 1304.101(h)(2)(iii) or a combined floating cabin as described in § 1304.101(h)(4) shall not exceed a total footprint of 400 square feet.\n\n(j) Any floating cabin not in compliance with this part is subject to the applicable removal provisions of § 1304.406 and section 9b of the TVA Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[86 FR 50633, Sept. 10, 2021, as amended at 89 FR 104881, Dec. 26, 2024]",

          "content": "§ 1304.405   Fuel storage tanks and handling facilities.\nFuel storage tanks and handling facilities are generally either underground (UST) or aboveground (AST) storage tank systems. An UST is any one or combination of tanks or tank systems defined in applicable Federal or State regulations as an UST. Typically (unless otherwise provided by applicable Federal or State rules), an UST is used to contain a regulated substance (such as a petroleum product) and has 10 percent or more of its total volume beneath the surface of the ground. The total volume includes any piping used in the system. An UST may be a buried tank, or an aboveground tank with buried piping if the piping holds 10 percent or more of the total system volume including the tank. For purposes of this part, an aboveground storage tank (AST) is any storage tank whose total volume (piping and tank) is less than 10 percent underground or any storage tank defined by applicable law or regulation as an AST. \n\n(a) TVA requires the following to be included in all applications submitted after September 8, 2003 to install an UST or any part of an UST system below the 500-year flood elevation on a TVA reservoir, or regulated tailwater: \n\n(1) A copy of the State approval for the UST along with a copy of the application sent to the State and any plans or drawings that were submitted for the State's review; \n\n(2) Evidence of secondary containment for all piping or other systems associated with the UST; \n\n(3) Evidence of secondary containment to contain leaks from gas pump(s); \n\n(4) Calculations certified by a licensed, professional engineer in the relevant State showing how the tank will be anchored so that it does not float during flooding; and \n\n(5) Evidence, where applicable, that the applicant has complied with all spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) requirements. \n\n(b) The applicant must accept and sign a document stating that the applicant shall at all times be the owner of the UST system, that TVA shall have the right (but no duty) to prevent or remedy pollution or violations of law, including removal of the UST system, with costs charged to the applicant, that the applicant shall at all times maintain and operate the UST system in full compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local UST regulations, and that the applicant shall maintain eligibility in any applicable State trust fund. \n\n(c) An application to install an AST or any part of an AST system below the 500-year elevation on a TVA reservoir or a regulated tailwater is subject to all of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section except that paragraph (a)(1) shall not apply in States that do not require application or approval for installation of an AST. Eligibility must be maintained for any applicable AST trust fund, and the system must be maintained and operated in accordance with any applicable AST regulations. The applicant must notify and obtain any required documents or permission from the State fire marshal's office prior to installation of the AST. The applicant must also follow the National Fire Protection Association Codes 30 and 30A for installation and maintenance of flammable and combustible liquids storage tanks at marine service stations. \n\n(d) Fuel handling on private, non-commercial docks and piers. TVA will not approve the installation, operation, or maintenance of fuel handling facilities on any private, non-commercial dock or pier. \n\n(e) Floating fuel handling facilities. TVA will not approve the installation of any floating fuel handling facility or fuel storage tank. \n\n(f) Demonstration of financial responsibility. Applicants for a fuel handling facility to be located in whole or in part on TVA land shall be required to provide TVA, in a form and amount acceptable to TVA, a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, pollution liability insurance, or other evidence of financial responsibility in the event of a release.",

Under TVA's implementation of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, repetitive actions are projects within a class of actions TVA has determined to be approvable without further review and documentation related to flood control storage, provided the loss of flood control storage caused by the project does not exceed one acre-foot. A partial list of repetitive actions includes: \n\n(1) Private and public water-use facilities; \n\n(2) Commercial recreation boat dock and water-use facilities; \n\n(3) Water intake structures; \n\n(4) Outfalls; \n\n(5) Mooring and loading facilities for barge terminals; \n\n(6) Minor grading and fills; and \n\n(7) Bridges and culverts for pedestrian, highway, and railroad crossings. \n\n(b) Projects resulting in flood storage loss in excess of one acre-foot will not be considered repetitive actions. \n\n(c) For projects not qualifying as repetitive actions, the applicant shall be required, as appropriate, to evaluate alternatives to the placement of fill or the construction of a project within the flood control storage zone that would result in lost flood control storage. The alternative evaluation would either identify a better option or support and document that there is no reasonable alternative to the loss of flood control storage. If this determination can be made, the applicant must then demonstrate how the loss of flood control storage will be minimized. \n\n(1) In addition, documentation shall be provided regarding: \n\n(i) The amount of anticipated flood control storage loss; \n\n(ii) The cost of compensation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from the flood control storage zone, haul it to an upland site and dispose of it); \n\n(iii) The cost of mitigation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from another site within the flood control storage zone, haul it to the project site and use as the fill material); \n\n(iv) The cost of the project; and \n\n(v) The nature and significance of any economic and/or natural resource benefits that would be realized as a result of the project. \n\n(2) TVA may, in its discretion, decline to permit any project that would result in the loss of flood control storage. \n\n(d) Recreational vehicles parked or placed within flood control storage zones of TVA reservoirs shall be deemed an obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations within the meaning of section 26a of the Act unless they: \n\n(1) Remain truly mobile and ready for highway use. The unit must be on its wheels or a jacking system and be attached to its site by only quick disconnect type utilities; \n\n(2) Have no permanently attached additions, connections, foundations, porches, or similar structures; and \n\n(3) Have an electrical cutoff switch that is located above the flood control zone and fully accessible during flood events.",

A claim must: \n\n(1) State the amount of monetary relief, or the kind of nonmonetary relief, sought, and identify the contract provision relied upon; \n\n(2) Include sufficient supporting data to permit the Contracting Officer to decide the claim, or provide appropriate reference to previously submitted data; \n\n(3) If monetary relief totalling more than $50,000 is involved, include a signed certification by the Contractor that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, and that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes TVA is liable; \n\n(4) Be signed by the Contractor, or on its behalf if the Contractor is other than an individual. If signed on a Contractor's behalf, the claim must include evidence of the authority of the individual so signing it, and of the individual signing any certification required by this paragraph, unless such authority appears in the contract or contract file. \n\nThe Contracting Officer has no authority to waive any of the requirements of this paragraph. \n\n(d) The term contract means an agreement in writing entered into by TVA for: \n\n(1) The procurement of property, other than real property in being; \n\n(2) The procurement of nonpersonal services; \n\n(3) The procurement of construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of real property; or \n\n(4) The disposal of personal property. The term “contract” does not include any TVA contract for the sale of fertilizer or electric power, or any TVA contract related to the conduct or operation of the electric power system. \n\n(e) The term Contracting Officer means TVA's Director of Purchasing, or duly authorized representative acting within the limits of the representative's authority. The TVA Purchasing Agent who administers a contract for TVA is designated as the duly authorized representative of the Director of Purchasing to act as Contracting Officer for all purposes in the administration of the contract (including, without limitation, decision of claims under the disputes clause). Such a designation continues until it is revoked or modified by written notice to the Contractor and the Purchasing Agent from TVA's Director of Purchasing. \n\n(f) The term Contractor means a party to a TVA contract which contains a disputes clause. The term “Contractor” does not include TVA. \n\n(g) The term disputes clause means a clause in a TVA contract requiring that a contract dispute be resolved through a TVA-conducted administrative process. It does not include, for example, arbitration provisions, or provisions specifying an independent third party to decide certain kinds of matters or special mechanisms to establish prices or price adjustments in contracts. \n\n(h) The term Hearing Officer means a member of the Board who has been designated to hear and determine a particular matter pending before the Board. \n\n(i) The term TVA means the Tennessee Valley Authority. \n\n(j) A term defined as in a contract subject to this part shall have the meaning given it in the contract.",

Contractor shall notify the TVA Concerns Resolution Staff Site Representative of such allegation or complaint in writing, together with a copy of any complaint. Contractor shall provide TVA any investigative reports that it may prepare and shall also provide to TVA a full written description of any management action taken in response to any such allegation or complaint.

Floodplain generally refers to the base floodplain, i.e., that area subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.\n\nImportant farmland includes prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland of statewide importance as defined in 7 CFR part 657.\n\nNatural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values refer to such attributes as the capability of floodplains and wetlands to provide natural moderation of floodwaters, water quality maintenance, fish and wildlife habitat, plant habitat, open space, natural beauty, scientific and educational study areas, and recreation.\n\nOfficial responsible for NEPA compliance refers to the TVA official who manages the NEPA compliance staff and is responsible for overall review of TVA NEPA compliance.\n\nPracticable, as used in subpart G of this part, refers to the capability of an action being performed within existing constraints. The test of what is practicable depends on the situation and includes an evaluation of all pertinent factors, such as environmental impact, economic costs, statutory authority, legality, technological achievability, and engineering constraints.\n\nWetland refers to an area inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does or would support, a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands do not include temporary human-made ponds associated with active construction projects.",
