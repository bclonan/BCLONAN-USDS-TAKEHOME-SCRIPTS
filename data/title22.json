This is true whether the debt is being collected under administrative offset, including salary offset, or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If STATE agrees to accept payment in installments, it may require a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability of the debtor to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within 3 years.",

For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain debts, debtors may also request an outside hearing. See subpart C of this part. This subpart rather than subpart C applies to collections by salary offset for debts arising under 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances), 5 U.S.C. 4108 (training expenses), and other statutes specifically providing for collection by salary offset. \n\n(b) A debtor requesting an internal review shall do so in writing to the contact office by the payment due date stated within the initial notice sent under 34.8(b) or other applicable provision. The debtor's written request shall state the basis for the dispute and include any relevant documentation in support. \n\n(1) STATE will provide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate official. The review may include examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials and discussion by letter or orally with the debtor, at STATE's discretion. An oral hearing may be provided when the matter cannot be decided on the documentary record because it involves issues of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, such oral hearing shall not be a formal evidentiary hearing. If an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by STATE. An oral hearing may be conducted, at the debtor's option, either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of STATE. During the period of review, STATE may suspend collection activity, including the accrual of interest and penalties, on any disputed portion of the debt if STATE determines that suspension is in the Department's best interest or would serve equity and good conscience. \n\n(2) If after review STATE either sustains or amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect the sustained or amended debt. If previously suspended, collection actions will be re-instituted unless payment of the sustained or amended amount is received or the debtor has made a proposal for a payment plan to which STATE agrees, by the date specified in the notification of STATE's decision.",

(1) Payments otherwise due the debtor from the United States shall be offset from the debt in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3. These may be funds under the control of the Department of State or other Federal agencies. Collection may be made through centralized offset by the Financial Management Service (“FMS”) of the Department of the Treasury. \n\n(2) Such payments include but are not limited to vendor payments, salary, retirement, lump sum payments due upon Federal employment separation, travel reimbursements, tax refunds, loans or other assistance. For offset of Federal salary payments under 5 U.S.C. 5514 for certain types of debt see subpart C of this part. \n\n(3) Administrative offset under this subsection does not apply to debts specified in the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.3(a)(2). \n\n(4) Before administrative offset is instituted by another Federal agency or the FMS, STATE shall certify in writing to that entity that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that STATE has complied with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal law and regulations. \n\n(5) Administrative offset of anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will be requested by STATE pursuant to 5 CFR 831.1801-1808. \n\n(6) Expedited offset. STATE may effect an offset against a debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor as described in § 34.8, when: \n\n(i) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment, \n\n(ii) Offset is executed pursuant to procedures set out in the Contracts Disputes Act, \n\n(iii) Previous notice and opportunity for review have been given, or \n\n(iv) There is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow prior notice and an opportunity for review. In such case, STATE shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government. \n\n(b) Referral to private collection agency. STATE may contract for collection services to recover delinquent debts, or transfer a delinquent debt to FMS for private collection action, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3718, 22 U.S.C. 2716 and the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.5, as applicable. STATE will not use a collection agency to collect a debt owed by a currently employed or retired Federal employee, if collection by salary or annuity offset is available. \n\n(c) Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies. STATE may disclose delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies and other automated databases in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) and the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.4, and in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Privacy Act 5 U.S.C. 552a. \n\n(d) Liquidation of Collateral, if applicable, in accordance with the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.7. \n\n(e) Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges in accordance with the FCCS, 31 CFR 901.6. \n\n(f) Litigation. Debts may be referred to the Department of Justice for litigation for collection in accordance with the standards set forth in the FCCS, 31 CFR part 904. \n\n(g) Transfer to FMS. Debts delinquent more than 180 days shall be transferred to the Financial Management Service of the Department of the Treasury for collection by all available means. Debts delinquent less that 180 days may also be so transferred. \n\n(h) Administrative wage garnishment. STATE may collect debts from a non-Federal employee's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. All parts of 31 CFR 285.11 are incorporated by reference into these regulations, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). \n\n(i) Salary offset.

What an employee should have known is evaluated under a reasonable person standard. Employees are, however, expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them. \n\n(iii) An employee with notice that a payment may be erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventual repayment. Financial hardship is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an erroneous payment. \n\n(iv) If the deciding official finds no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatically entitled to a waiver. Before a waiver can be granted, the deciding official must also determine that collection of the claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States include, but are not limited to: \n\n(A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom collection is sought. \n\n(B) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the employee either has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of the employee's financial circumstances. \n\n(C) The time elapsed between the erroneous payment and discovery of the error and notification of the employee; \n\n(D) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee; \n\n(E) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances. \n\n(2) Debts arising out of advances in pay. 5 U.S.C. 5524a provides authority for waiving in whole or in part a debt arising out of an advance in pay if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest. \n\n(i) Factors to be considered when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest include, but are not limited to: \n\n(A) Death of the employee;

          "content": "§ 40.1   Definitions.\nThe following definitions supplement definitions contained in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). As used in the regulations in parts 40, 41, 42, 43 and 45 of this subchapter, the term:\n\n(a)(1) Accompanying or accompanied by means not only an alien in the physical company of a principal alien but also an alien who is issued an immigrant visa within 6 months of:\n\n(i) The date of issuance of a visa to the principal alien;\n\n(ii) The date of adjustment of status in the United States of the principal alien; or\n\n(iii) The date on which the principal alien personally appears and registers before a consular officer abroad to confer alternate foreign state chargeability or immigrant status upon a spouse or child.\n\n(2) An “accompanying” relative may not precede the principal alien to the United States.\n\n(b) Act means the Immigration and Nationality Act (or INA), as amended. \n\n(c) Competent officer, as used in INA 101(a)(26), means a “consular officer” as defined in INA 101(a)(9).\n\n(d) Consular officer, as defined in INA 101(a)(9) includes commissioned consular officers and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, and such other officers as the Deputy Assistant Secretary may designate for the purpose of issuing nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, but does not include a consular agent, an attaché or an assistant attaché. For purposes of this regulation, the term “other officers” includes civil service visa examiners employed by the Department of State for duty at visa-issuing offices abroad, upon certification by the chief of the consular section under whose direction such examiners are employed that the examiners are qualified by knowledge and experience to perform the functions of a consular officer in the issuance or refusal of visas. The designation of visa examiners shall expire upon termination of the examiners' employment for such duty and may be terminated at any time for cause by the Deputy Assistant Secretary. The assignment by the Department of any foreign service officer to a diplomatic or consular office abroad in a position administratively designated as requiring, solely, partially, or principally, the performance of consular functions, and the initiation of a request for a consular commission, constitutes designation of the officer as a “consular officer” within the meaning of INA 101(a)(9).\n\n(e) Department means the Department of State of the United States of America. \n\n(f) Dependent area means a colony or other component or dependent area overseas from the governing foreign state.\n\n(g) DHS means the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n(h) Documentarily qualified means that the alien has reported that all the documents specified by the consular officer as sufficient to meet the requirements of INA 222(b) have been obtained, and the consular office has completed the necessary clearance procedures. This term is used only with respect to the alien's qualification to apply formally for an immigrant visa; it bears no connotation that the alien is eligible to receive a visa.\n\n(i) Entitled to immigrant classification means that the alien: \n\n(1) Is the beneficiary of an approved petition granting immediate relative or preference status; \n\n(2) Has satisfied the consular officer as to entitlement to special immigrant status under INA 101(a)(27) (A) or (B); \n\n(3) Has been selected by the annual selection system to apply under INA 203(c); or \n\n(4) Is an alien described in § 40.51(c). \n\n(j) Foreign state, for the purposes of alternate chargeability pursuant to INA 202(b), is not restricted to those areas to which the numerical limitation prescribed by INA 202(a) applies but includes dependent areas, as defined in this section.\n\n(k) INA means the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.\n\n(l) Make or file an application for a visa means: \n\n(1) For a nonimmigrant visa applicant, submitting for formal adjudication by a consular officer of an electronic application, Form DS-160, signed electronically by clicking the box designated “Sign Application” in the certification section of the application or, as directed by a consular officer, a completed Form DS-156, with any required supporting documents and biometric data, as well as the requisite processing fee or evidence of the prior payment of the processing fee when such documents are received and accepted for adjudication by the consular officer.\n\n(2) For an immigrant visa applicant, personally appearing before a consular officer and verifying by oath or affirmation the statements contained on Form DS-230 or Form DS-260 and in all supporting documents, having previously submitted all forms and documents required in advance of the appearance and paid the visa application processing fee.\n\n(m) Native means born within the territory of a foreign state, or entitled to be charged for immigration purposes to that foreign state pursuant to INA section 202(b).\n\n(n) Not subject to numerical limitation means that the alien is entitled to immigrant status as an immediate relative within the meaning of INA 201(b)(2)(i), or as a special immigrant within the meaning of INA 101(a)(27) (A) and (B), unless specifically subject to a limitation other than under INA 201(a), (b), or (c). \n\n(o) Parent, father, and mother, as defined in INA 101(b)(2), are terms which are not changed in meaning if the child becomes 21 years of age or marries. \n\n(p) Port of entry means a port or place designated by the DHS at which an alien may apply to DHS for admission into the United States. \n\n(q) Principal alien means an alien from whom another alien derives a privilege or status under the law or regulations. \n\n(r) Regulation means a rule which is established under the provisions of INA 104(a) and is duly published in the Federal Register. \n\n(s) Son or daughter includes only a person who would have qualified as a “child” under INA 101(b)(1) if the person were under 21 and unmarried. \n\n(t) Western Hemisphere means North America (including Central America), South America and the islands immediately adjacent thereto including the places named in INA 101(b)(5). \n\n[56 FR 30422, July 2, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 43552, Sept. 3, 1991; 59 FR 15300, Mar. 31, 1994; 61 FR 1835, Jan. 24, 1996; 64 FR 55418, Oct. 13, 1999; 65 FR 54413, Sept. 8, 2000; 71 FR 34520, June 15, 2006; 73 FR 23068, Apr. 29, 2008; 75 FR 45476, Aug. 3, 2010]",

However, a Consular Officer must base a determination that a crime involves moral turpitude upon the moral standards generally prevailing in the United States.\n\n(2) Conviction for crime committed under age 18. (i) An alien will not be ineligible to receive a visa under INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) by reason of any offense committed:\n\n(A) Prior to the alien's fifteenth birthday, or\n\n(B) Between the alien's fifteenth and eighteenth birthdays unless such alien was tried and convicted as an adult for a felony involving violence as defined in section 1(1) and section 16 of Title 18 of the United States Code.\n\n(ii) An alien tried and convicted as an adult for a violent felony offense, as so defined, committed after having attained the age of fifteen years, will be subject to the provisions of INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) regardless of whether at the time of conviction juvenile courts existed within the convicting jurisdiction.\n\n(3) Two or more crimes committed under age 18. An alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude or admitting the commission of acts which constitute the essential elements of such a crime and who has committed an additional crime involving moral turpitude shall be ineligible under INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), even though the crimes were committed while the alien was under the age of 18 years. \n\n(4) Conviction in absentia. A conviction in absentia of a crime involving moral turpitude does not constitute a conviction within the meaning of INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). \n\n(5) Effect of pardon by appropriate U.S. authorities/foreign states. An alien shall not be considered ineligible under INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) by reason of a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude for which a full and unconditional pardon has been granted by the President of the United States. A legislative pardon, a pardon by the Governor of a State of the United States, or a pardon, amnesty, expungement of penal record or any other act of clemency granted by a foreign state shall not serve to remove a ground of ineligibility under INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).\n\n(6) Political offenses. The term “purely political offense”, as used in INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), includes offenses that resulted in convictions obviously based on fabricated charges or predicated upon repressive measures against racial, religious, or political minorities. \n\n(7) Waiver of ineligibility—INA 212(h).

An organization which gives, loans, or promises support, money, or other thing of value for any purpose to any proscribed association or party is presumed to be an affiliate of such association or party, but nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as an exclusive definition of the term affiliate. \n\n(b) Service in Armed Forces. Service, whether voluntary or not, in the armed forces of any country shall not be regarded, of itself, as constituting or establishing an alien's membership in, or affiliation with, any proscribed party or organization, and shall not, of itself, constitute a ground of ineligibility to receive a visa. \n\n(c) Voluntary Service in a Political Capacity. Voluntary service in a political capacity shall constitute affiliation with the political party or organization in power at the time of such service. \n\n(d) Voluntary Membership After Age 16. If an alien continues or continued membership in or affiliation with a proscribed organization on or after reaching 16 years of age, only the alien's activities after reaching that age shall be pertinent to a determination of whether the continuation of membership or affiliation is or was voluntary. \n\n(e) Operation of Law Defined. The term operation of law, as used in INA 212(a)(3)(D), includes any case wherein the alien automatically, and without personal acquiescence, became a member of or affiliated with a proscribed party or organization by official act, proclamation, order, edict, or decree. \n\n(f) Membership in Organization Advocating Totalitarian Dictatorship in the United States. In accordance with the definition of totalitarian party contained in INA 101(a)(37), a former or present voluntary member of, or an alien who was, or is, voluntarily affiliated with a noncommunist party, organization, or group, or of any section, subsidiary, branch, affiliate or subdivision thereof, which during the time of its existence did not or does not advocate the establishment in the United States of a totalitarian dictatorship, is not considered ineligible under INA 212(a)(3)(D) to receive a visa. \n\n(g) Waiver of ineligibility—212(a)(3)(D)(iv). lf an immigrant visa applicant is ineligible under INA 212(a)(3)(D) but is qualified to seek the benefits of INA 212(a)(3)(D)(iv), the consular officer shall inform the alien of the procedure for applying to DHS for relief under that provision of law.

Any determination that an alien is ineligible under INA 212(a)(4) must be predicated upon circumstances indicating that, notwithstanding any affidavit of support that may have been filed on the alien's behalf, the alien is likely to become a public charge after admission, or, if applicable, that the alien has failed to fulfill the affidavit of support requirement of INA 212(a)(4)(C).\n\n(b) Affidavit of support. Any alien seeking an immigrant visa under INA 201(b)(2), 203(a), or 203(b), based upon a petition filed by a relative of the alien (or in the case of a petition filed under INA 203(b) by an entity in which a relative has a significant ownership interest), shall be required to present to the consular officer an affidavit of support (AOS) on a form that complies with terms and conditions established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Petitioners for applicants at a post designated by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services for initial review of and assistance with such an AOS will be charged a fee for such review and assistance pursuant to the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (22 CFR 22.1).\n\n(c) Joint sponsors. Submission of one or more additional affidavits of support by a joint sponsor/sponsors is required whenever the relative sponsor's household income and significant assets, and the immigrant's assets, do not meet the Federal poverty line requirements of INA 213A.\n\n(d) Posting of bond. A consular officer may issue a visa to an alien who is within the purview of INA 212(a)(4) (subject to the affidavit of support requirement and attribution of sponsor's income and resources under section 213A), upon receipt of a notice from DHS of the giving of a bond or undertaking in accordance with INA 213 and INA 221(g), and provided further that the officer is satisfied that the giving of such bond or undertaking removes the likelihood that the alien will become a public charge within the meaning of this section of the law and that the alien is otherwise eligible in all respects.\n\n(e) Prearranged employment. An immigrant visa applicant relying on an offer of prearranged employment to establish eligibility under INA 212(a)(4), other than an offer of employment certified by the Department of Labor pursuant to INA 212(a)(5)(A), must provide written confirmation of the relevant information sworn and subscribed to before a notary public by the employer or an authorized employee or agent of the employer. The signer's printed name and position or other relationship with the employer must accompany the signature.\n\n(f) Use of Federal poverty line Where INA 213A not applicable. An immigrant visa applicant, not subject to the requirements of INA 213A, and relying solely on personal income to establish eligibility under INA 212(a)(4), who does not demonstrate an annual income above the Federal poverty line, as defined in INA 213A(h), and who is without other adequate financial resources, shall be presumed ineligible under INA 212(a)(4).\n\n[88 FR 60582, Sept. 5, 2023]",

The nonimmigrant visa applicant's admission to the United States would advance a U.S. national security interest;\n\n(iii) Law enforcement.

The nonimmigrant visa applicant's admission to the United States would advance a significant U.S. public interest, or\n\n(v) Urgent humanitarian or medical reasons. The nonimmigrant visa applicant's admission to the United States may be warranted due to urgent humanitarian or medical reasons.\n\n(b) Recommendation to designated DHS office. Consular officers may recommend directly to the designated DHS office that the alien be admitted temporarily despite his or her inadmissibility in any case where a waiver may be available, unless the consular officer has reason to believe that the applicant is inadmissible under INA 212(a)(3)(A)(i), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii), (3)(B), (3)(C), (3)(D), (3)(E)(i), (3)(E)(ii), (3)(E)(iii), (3)(F), or (3)(G) .

When the Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes the temporary admission of an inadmissible alien as a nonimmigrant and the consular officer is so informed, the consular officer may proceed with the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to the alien, subject to the conditions, if any, imposed by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n[84 FR 19714, May 6, 2019]",

(1) An alien is classifiable A-1 or A-2 under INA section 101(a)(15)(A) (i) or (ii) if the principal alien:\n\n(i) Has been accredited by a foreign government recognized de jure by the United States;\n\n(ii) Intends to engage solely in official activities for that foreign government while in the United States; and\n\n(iii) Has been accepted by the President, the Secretary of State, or a consular officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.\n\n(2) A member of the immediate family of a principal alien is classifiable A-1 or A-2 under INA section 101(a)(15)(A)(i) or (ii) if the principal alien is so classified.\n\n(b) Classification under INA section 101(a)(15)(A). An alien entitled to classification under INA section 101(a)(15)(A) shall be classified under this section even if eligible for another nonimmigrant classification. An exception may be made where an immediate family member is classifiable as A-1 or A-2 under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is also independently classifiable as a principal under INA section 101(a)(15)(G)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or in NATO-1 through NATO-6 classification.\n\n(c) Classification of attendants, servants, and personal employees. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(A)(iii) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under those provisions.\n\n(d) Referral to the Department of special cases concerning principal alien applicants. In any case in which there is uncertainty about the applicability of these regulations to a principal alien applicant requesting such nonimmigrant status, the matter shall be immediately referred to the Department for consideration as to whether acceptance of accreditation will be granted.\n\n(e) Change of classification to that of a foreign government official. In the case of an alien in the United States seeking a change of nonimmigrant classification under INA 248 to a classification under INA 101(a)(15)(A) (i) or (ii), the question of acceptance of accreditation is determined by the Department.\n\n(f) Termination of status. The Department may, in its discretion, cease to recognize as entitled to classification under INA 101(a)(15)(A) (i) or (ii) any alien who has nonimmigrant status under that provision.\n\n(g) Classification of foreign government official. A foreign government official or employee seeking to enter the United States temporarily other than as a representative or employee of a foreign government is not classifiable under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(A).\n\n(h) Courier and acting courier on official business—(1) Courier of career. An alien regularly and professionally employed as a courier by the government of the country to which the alien owes allegiance is classifiable as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(A)(i), if the alien is proceeding to the United States on official business for that government.\n\n(2) Official acting as courier. An alien not regularly and professionally employed as a courier by the government of the country to which the alien owes allegiance is classifiable as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(A)(ii), if the alien is holding an official position and is proceeding to the United States as a courier on official business for that government.\n\n(3) Nonofficial serving as courier. An alien serving as a courier but not regularly and professionally employed as such who holds no official position with, or is not a national of, the country whose government the alien is serving, shall be classified as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(B).\n\n(i) Official of foreign government not recognized by the United States. An official of a foreign government not recognized de jure by the United States, who is proceeding to or through the United States on an official mission or to an international organization shall be classified as a nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15) (B), (C), or (G)(iii).\n\n[52 FR 42597, Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 78 FR 33700, June 5, 2013; 81 FR 88103, Dec. 7, 2016]",

An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant visitor for business (B-1) or pleasure (B-2) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(B), and that:\n\n(1) The alien intends to leave the United States at the end of the temporary stay (consular officers are authorized, if departure of the alien as required by law does not seem fully assured, to require the posting of a bond with the Secretary of Homeland Security in a sufficient sum to ensure that at the end of the temporary visit, or upon failure to maintain temporary visitor status, or any status subsequently acquired under INA 248, the alien will depart from the United States);\n\n(2) The alien has permission to enter a foreign country at the end of the temporary stay; and\n\n(3) Adequate financial arrangements have been made to enable the alien to carry out the purpose of the visit to and departure from the United States.\n\n(b) Definitions. (1) The term “business,” as used in INA 101(a)(15)(B), refers to conventions, conferences, consultations and other legitimate activities of a commercial or professional nature. It does not include local employment or labor for hire. For the purposes of this section building or construction work, whether on-site or in plant, shall be deemed to constitute purely local employment or labor for hire; provided that the supervision or training of others engaged in building or construction work (but not the actual performance of any such building or construction work) shall not be deemed to constitute purely local employment or labor for hire if the alien is otherwise qualified as a B-1 nonimmigrant. An alien seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant for employment or labor pursuant to a contract or other prearrangement is required to qualify under the provisions of § 41.53. An alien of distinguished merit and ability seeking to enter the United States temporarily with the idea of performing temporary services of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability, but having no contract or other prearranged employment, may be classified as a nonimmigrant temporary visitor for business.\n\n(2)(i) The term pleasure, as used in INA 101(a)(15)(B) for the purpose of visa issuance, refers to legitimate activities of a recreational character, including tourism, amusement, visits with friends or relatives, rest, medical treatment, and activities of a fraternal, social, or service nature, and does not include obtaining a visa for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States.\n\n(ii) Any visa applicant who seeks medical treatment in the United States under this provision shall be denied a visa under INA section 214(b) if unable to establish, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, a legitimate reason why he or she wishes to travel to the United States for medical treatment, that a medical practitioner or facility in the United States has agreed to provide treatment, and that the applicant has reasonably estimated the duration of the visit and all associated costs. The applicant also shall be denied a visa under INA section 214(b) if unable to establish to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she has the means derived from lawful sources and intent to pay for the medical treatment and all incidental expenses, including transportation and living expenses, either independently or with the pre-arranged assistance of others.\n\n(iii) Any B nonimmigrant visa applicant who a consular officer has reason to believe will give birth during her stay in the United States is presumed to be traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for the child.\n\n[52 FR 42597, Nov. 5, 1987; 53 FR 9172, Mar. 21, 1988, as amended at 85 FR 4225, Jan. 24, 2020]",

A consular or immigration officer may revoke a BCC issued on Form I-186 or Form I-586, or a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC under the provisions of § 41.122, or if the consular or immigration officer determines that the alien to whom any such document was issued has ceased to be a resident and/or a citizen of Mexico. Upon revocation, the consular or immigration officer shall notify the issuing consular or immigration office. If the revoked document is a card, the consular or immigration officer shall take possession of the card and physically cancel it under standard security conditions. If the revoked document is a stamp in a passport the consular or immigration officer shall write or stamp “canceled” on the face of the document.\n\n(d) Voidance. (1) The voiding pursuant to INA 222(g) of the visa portion of a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued at any time by a consular officer in Mexico under provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299, edition revised as of April 1, 1998, also voids the BCC portion of that document.\n\n(2) A BCC issued at any time by a consular officer in Mexico under any provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299, edition revised as of April 1, 1998, is void if a consular or immigration officer determines that the alien has violated the conditions of the alien's admission into the United States, including the period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n(3) A consular or immigration officer shall immediately take possession of a card determined to be void under paragraphs (d) (1) or (2) of this section and physically cancel it under standard security conditions. If the document voided in paragraphs (d) (1) or (2) is in the form of a stamp in a passport the officer shall write or stamp “canceled” across the face of the document.\n\n(e) Replacement. When a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued under the provisions of this section, or a BCC or B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued under any provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299, edition revised as of April 1, 1998, has been lost, mutilated, destroyed, or expired, the person to whom such card was issued may apply for a new B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC as provided in this section.\n\n[64 FR 45163, Aug. 19, 1999, as amended at 71 FR 30591, May 30, 2006; 71 FR 34521, June 15, 2006; 73 FR 23068, Apr. 29, 2008]",

          "content": "§ 41.51   Treaty trader, treaty investor, or treaty alien in a specialty occupation.\n(a) Treaty trader—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty trader (E-1) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(i) and that the alien:\n\n(i) Will be in the United States solely to carry on trade of a substantial nature, which is international in scope, either on the alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organization engaged in trade, principally between the United States and the foreign state of which the alien is a national, (consideration being given to any conditions in the country of which the alien is a national which may affect the alien's ability to carry on such substantial trade); and\n\n(ii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E-1 status.\n\n(2) Employee of treaty trader. An alien employee of a treaty trader may be classified E-1 if the employee is in or is coming to the United States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed in a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualifications that make the services to be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employer must be:\n\n(i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the status of treaty trader if in the United States or, if not in the United States, would be classifiable as a treaty trader; or\n\n(ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the treaty country who are maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader status if residing in the United States or, if not residing in the United States, who would be classifiable as treaty traders.\n\n(3) Spouse and children of treaty trader. The spouse and children of a treaty trader accompanying or following to join the principal alien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treaty trader is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E).\n\n(4) Representative of foreign information media. Representatives of foreign information media shall first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before consideration is given to their possible classification as treaty traders under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E) and of this section.\n\n(5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation or its equivalent exists with the United States. A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 101(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA).\n\n(6) Nationality of the treaty country. The authorities of the foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty trader. In the case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicable to the individuals who ultimately own the organization.\n\n(7) Trade. The term “trade” as used in this section means the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Existing trade includes successfully negotiated contracts binding upon the parties that call for the immediate exchange of items of trade. This exchange must be traceable and identifiable. Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to the other.\n\n(8) Item of trade. Items that qualify for trade within these provisions include but are not limited to goods, services, technology, monies, international banking, insurance, transportation, tourism, communications, and some news gathering activities.\n\n(9) Substantial trade. Substantial trade for the purposes of this section entails the quantum of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of trade items between the United States and the treaty country. This continuous flow contemplates numerous exchanges over time rather than a single transaction, regardless of the monetary value. Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a relevant consideration, greater weight is given to more numerous exchanges of larger value. In the case of smaller businesses, an income derived from the value of numerous transactions that is sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or her family constitutes a favorable factor in assessing the existence of substantial trade.\n\n(10) Principal trade. Trade shall be considered to be principal trade between the United States and the treaty country when over 50% of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is conducted between the United States and the treaty country of the treaty trader's nationality.\n\n(11) Executive or supervisory character. The executive or supervisory element of the employee's position must be a principal and primary function of the position and not an incidental or collateral function. Executive and/or supervisory duties grant the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof.\n\n(i) An executive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise.\n\n(ii) A position primarily of supervisory character grants the employee supervisory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations and does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees.\n\n(12) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are those skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the successful or efficient operation of the enterprise.\n\n(i) The essential nature of the alien's skills to the employing firm is determined by assessing the degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved, the uniqueness of the specific skill or aptitude, the length of experience and/or training with the firm, the period of training or other experience necessary to perform effectively the projected duties, and the salary the special qualifications can command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(ii) Whether the special qualifications are essential will be assessed in light of all circumstances at the time of each visa application on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills required to start up an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essential only in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term essentiality might, however, be established in connection with continuous activities in such areas as product improvement, quality control, or the provision of a service not generally available in the United States.\n\n(13) Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico shall not be entitled to classification under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that:\n\n(i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place or intended place of employment; and\n\n(ii) The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will not affect adversely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout.\n\n(b) Treaty investor—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty investor (E'2) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(ii) and that the alien:\n\n(i) Has invested or is actively in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital in bona fide enterprise in the United States, as distinct from a relatively small amount of capital in a marginal enterprise solely for the purpose of earning a living; and\n\n(ii) Is seeking entry solely to develop and direct the enterprise; and\n\n(iii) Intends to depart from the United States upon the termination of E'2 status.\n\n(2) Employee of treaty investor. An alien employee of a treaty investor may be classified E-2 if the employee is in or is coming to the United States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed in a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualifications that make the services to be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employer must be:\n\n(i) A person having the nationality of the treaty country, who is maintaining the status of treaty investor if in the United States or, if not in the United States, who would be classifiable as a treaty investor; or\n\n(ii) An organization at least 50% owned by persons having the nationality of the treaty country who are maintaining nonimmigrant treaty investor status if residing in the United States or, if not residing in the United States, who would be classifiable as treaty investors.\n\n(3) Spouse and children of treaty investor. The spouse and children of a treaty investor accompanying or following to join the principal alien are entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treaty investor is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E).\n\n(4) Representative of foreign information media. Representatives of foreign information media shall first be considered for possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(I), before consideration is given to their possible classification as nonimmigrants under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E) and of this section.\n\n(5) Treaty country. A treaty country is for purposes of this section a foreign state with which a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation or its equivalent exists with the United States. A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa privileges under INA 101(a)(15)(E) by specific legislation (other than the INA).\n\n(6) Nationality of the treaty country. The authorities of the foreign state of which the alien claims nationality determine the nationality of an individual treaty investor. In the case of an organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicable to the individuals who ultimately own the organization.\n\n(7) Investment. Investment means the treaty investor's placing of capital, including funds and other assets, at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor must be in possession of and have control over the capital invested or being invested. The capital must be subject to partial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured personal business capital or capital secured by personal assets. Capital in the process of being invested or that has been invested must be irrevocably committed to the enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment given to the particular circumstances of each case. The alien may use any legal mechanism available, such as by placing invested funds in escrow pending visa issuance, that would not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise but that might also extend some personal liability protection to the treaty investor.\n\n(8) Bona fide enterprise. The enterprise must be a real and active commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking, producing some service or commodity for profit and must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the United States.\n\n(9) Substantial amount of capital. A substantial amount of capital constitutes that amount that is:\n\n(i)(A) Substantial in the proportional sense, i.e., in relationship to the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or creating the type of enterprise under consideration;\n\n(B) Sufficient to ensure the treaty investor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and\n\n(C) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise.\n\n(ii) Whether an amount of capital is substantial in the proportionality sense is understood in terms of an inverted sliding scale; i.e., the lower the total cost of the enterprise, the higher, proportionately, the investment must be to meet these criteria.\n\n(10) Marginal enterprise. A marginal enterprise is an enterprise that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. An enterprise that does not have the capacity to generate such income but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contribution is not a marginal enterprise. The projected future capacity should generally be realizable within five years from the date the alien commences normal business activity of the enterprise.\n\n(11) Solely to develop and direct. The business or individual treaty investor does or will develop and direct the enterprise by controlling the enterprise through ownership of at least 50% of the business, by possessing operational control through a managerial position or other corporate device, or by other means.\n\n(12) Executive or supervisory character. The executive or supervisory element of the employee's position must be a principal and primary function of the position and not an incidental or collateral function. Executive and/or supervisory duties grant the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof.\n\n(i) An executive position provides the employee great authority to determine policy of and direction for the enterprise.\n\n(ii) A position primarily of supervisory character grants the employee supervisory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations and does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees.\n\n(13) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are those skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the successful or efficient operation of the enterprise.\n\n(i) The essential nature of the alien's skills to the employing firm is determined by assessing the degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved, the uniqueness of the specific skill or aptitude, the length of experience and/or training with the firm, the period of training or other experience necessary to perform effectively the projected duties, and the salary the special qualifications can command. The question of special skills and qualifications must be determined by assessing the circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(ii) Whether the special qualifications are essential will be assessed in light of all circumstances at the time of each visa application on a case-by-case basis. A skill that is unique at one point may become commonplace at a later date. Skills required to start up an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and are running smoothly. Some skills are essential only in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Long-term essentiality might, however, be established in connection with continuous activities in such areas as product improvement, quality control, or the provision of a service not generally available in the United States.\n\n(14) Labor disputes. Citizens of Canada or Mexico shall not be entitled to classification under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor have certified that:\n\n(i) There is in progress a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place or intended place of employment; and\n\n(ii) The alien has failed to establish that the alien's entry will not affect adversely the settlement of the strike or lockout or the employment of any person who is involved in the strike or lockout.\n\n(c) Nonimmigrant E-3 treaty aliens in specialty occupations—(1) Classification. An alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant treaty alien in a specialty occupation if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien qualifies under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) and that the alien:\n\n(i) Possesses the nationality of the country statutorily designated for treaty aliens in specialty occupation status;\n\n(ii) Satisfies the requirements of INA 214(i)(1) and the corresponding regulations defining specialty occupation promulgated by the Department of Homeland Security;\n\n(iii) Presents to a consular officer a copy of the Labor Condition Application signed by the employer and approved by the Department of Labor, and meeting the attestation requirements of INA Section 212(t)(1);\n\n(iv) Presents to a consular officer evidence of the alien's academic or other qualifying credentials as required under INA 214(i)(1), and a job offer letter or other documentation from the employer establishing that upon entry into the United States the applicant will be engaged in qualifying work in a specialty occupation, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and that the alien will be paid the actual or prevailing wage referred to in INA 212(t)(1);\n\n(v) Has a visa number allocated under INA 214(g)(11)(B); and,\n\n(vi) Intends to depart upon the termination of E-3 status.\n\n(2) Spouse and children of treaty alien in a specialty occupation. The spouse and children of a treaty alien in a specialty occupation accompanying or following to join the principal alien are, if otherwise admissible, entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. A spouse or child of a principal E-3 treaty alien need not have the same nationality as the principal in order to be classifiable under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E). Spouses and children of E-3 principals are not subject to the numerical limitations of INA 214(g)(11)(B).\n\n[70 FR 52293, Sept. 2, 2005]",

Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, provides in substance as follows:\n\n(1) No person admitted under Section 101(a) (15)(J) or acquiring such status after admission:\n\n(i) Whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the United States Government or by the government of the country of his nationality or of his last legal permanent residence;\n\n(ii) Who at the time of admission or acquisition of status under 101(a)(15)(J) was a national or legal permanent resident of a country which the Secretary of State, pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was engaged [See the most recent “Revised Exchange Visitor Skills List”, at http://exchanges.state.gov/education/jexchanges/participation/skills_list.pdf; or \n\n(iii) Who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until is established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last legal permanent residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States.\n\n(2) Upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or in the case of an alien who is a graduate of a foreign medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training, pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Secretary of Homeland Security after the latter has determined that departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a legal permanent resident alien), or that the alien cannot return to the country of his nationality or last legal permanent residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Secretary of Homeland Security to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver requested by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184).\n\n(3) Except in the case of an alien who is a graduate of a foreign medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training, the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State, may also waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last legal permanent residence has furnished the Secretary of State a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien.

(1) Applications for waiver of the two-year home-country residence and physical presence requirement may be supported by a statement of no objection by the exchange visitor's country of nationality or last legal permanent residence. The statement of no objection shall be directed to the Secretary of State through diplomatic channels; i.e., from the country's Foreign Office to the Department of State through the U.S. Mission in the foreign country concerned, or through the foreign country's head of mission or duly appointed designee in the United States to the Secretary of State in the form of a diplomatic note.

If deemed appropriate, the Department of State may request the views of each of the exchange visitor's sponsors concerning the waiver application.\n\n(2) The Waiver Review Division shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forward its recommendation to the Secretary of DHS. Except as set forth in § 41.63(g)(4), infra, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Division shall constitute the recommendation of the Department of State.\n\n(3) An exchange visitor who is a graduate of a foreign medical school and who is pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training in the United States is prohibited under section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act from applying for a waiver solely on the basis of no objection from his or her country of nationality or last legal permanent residence. However, an alien who is a graduate of a foreign medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training may obtain a waiver of such two-year foreign residence requirements if said alien meets the requirements of section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184) and paragraphs (a)(2) and (e) of this section.\n\n(e) Requests for waiver from a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, on the basis of Public Law 103-416. (1) Pursuant to Public Law 103-416, in the case of an alien who is a graduate of a medical school pursuing a program in graduate medical education or training, a request for a waiver of the two-year home-country residence and physical presence requirement may be made by a State department of Public Health, or its equivalent. Such waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1194(l)) and this § 41.63.\n\n(2) With respect to such waiver under Public Law 104-416, if such alien is contractually obligated to return to his or her home country upon completion of the graduate medical education or training, the Secretary of State is to be furnished with a statement in writing that the country to which such alien is required to return has no objection to such waiver. The no objection statement shall be furnished to the Secretary of State in the manner and form set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and, additionally, shall bear a notation that it is being furnished pursuant to Public Law 103-416.\n\n(3) The State Department of Public Health, or equivalent agency, shall include in the waiver application the following:\n\n(i) A completed DS-3035. Copies of these forms may be obtained from the Visa Office or online at http://www.travel.state.gov.\n\n(ii) A letter from the Director of the designated State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, which identifies the foreign medical graduate by name, country of nationality or country of last legal permanent residence, and date of birth, and states that it is in the public interest that a waiver of the two-year home residence requirement be granted;\n\n(iii) An employment contract between the foreign medical graduate and the health care facility named in the waiver application, to include the name and address of the health care facility, and the specific geographical area or areas in which the foreign medical graduate will practice medicine. The employment contract shall include a statement by the foreign medical graduate that he or she agrees to meet the requirements set forth in section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The term of the employment contract shall be at least three years and the geographical areas of employment shall only be in areas, within the respective state, designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals, unless the waiver request is for an alien who will practice medicine in a facility that serves patients who reside in one or more geographic areas so designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services without regard to whether such facility is located within such a designated geographic area. For the latter situation, which will be referred to as “non-designated requests”, the contract should also state that the term of the employment contract shall be at least three years and employment shall only be in a facility that serves patients who reside in one or more geographic areas so designed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals.\n\n(iv) Evidence establishing that the geographic area or areas in the state in which the foreign medical graduate will practice medicine or where patients who will be served by the foreign medical graduates reside, are areas which have been designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals. For purposes of this paragraph, the geographic area or areas must be designated by the Department of Health and Human Services as a Health Professional Shortage Area (“HPSA”) or as a Medically Underserved Area/Medically Underserved Population (“MUA/MUP”).\n\n(v) Copies of all forms IAP 66 or DS-2019 issued to the foreign medical graduate seeking the waiver; \n\n(vi) A copy of the foreign medical graduate's curriculum vitae;\n\n(vii) If the foreign medical graduate is otherwise contractually required to return to his or her home country at the conclusion of the graduate medical education or training, a copy of the statement of no objection from the foreign medical graduate's country of nationality or last residence; and,\n\n(viii) Because of the numerical limitations on the approval of waivers under Public Law 103-416, i.e., no more than the maximum number of waivers for each State each fiscal year as mandated by law, each application from a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, shall be numbered sequentially, beginning on October 1 of each year. The “non-designated” requests will also be numbered sequentially with appropriate identifier.\n\n(4) The Waiver Review Division shall review the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forward its recommendation to the Secretary of DHS. Except as set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the recommendation of the Waiver Review Division shall constitute the recommendation of the Department of State.\n\n(f) Changed circumstances. An applicant for a waiver on the grounds of exceptional hardship or probable persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, has a continuing obligation to inform the Department of Homeland Security of changed circumstances material to his or her pending application.\n\n(g) The Waiver Review Board. (1) The Waiver Review Board (“Board”) shall consist of the following persons or their designees:\n\n(i) The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Consular Affairs;\n\n(ii) The Director of Office of Public Affairs for the Bureau of Consular Affairs;\n\n(iii) The Legislative Management Officer for Consular Affairs, Bureau of Legislative Affairs;\n\n(iv) The Director of the Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs; and\n\n(v) The Director of the Office of Policy and Evaluation in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\n\n(2) A person who has had substantial prior involvement in a particular case referred to the Board may not be appointed to, or serve on, the Board for that particular case unless the Bureau of Consular Affairs determines that the individual's inclusion on the Board is otherwise necessary or practicably unavoidable.\n\n(3) The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Consular Affairs, or his or her designee, shall serve as Board Chairman. No designee under this paragraph (g)(3) shall serve for more than 2 years.\n\n(4) Cases will be referred to the Board at the discretion of the Chief, Waiver Review Division, of the Visa Office. The Chief, Waiver Review Division, or his or her designee may, at the Chairman's discretion, appear and present facts related to the case but shall not participate in Board deliberations.\n\n(5) The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for convening the Board and distributing all necessary information to its members. Upon being convened, the Board shall review the case file and weigh the request against the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case.\n\n(6) The Bureau of Consular Affairs shall appoint, on a case-by-case basis, from among the attorneys in the State Department's Office of Legal Advisor one attorney to serve as legal advisor to the Board.\n\n(7) At the conclusion of its review of the case, the Board shall make a written recommendation either to grant or to deny the waiver application. The written recommendation of a majority of the Board shall constitute the recommendation of the Board. Such recommendation shall be promptly transmitted by the Chairman to the Chief, Waiver Review Division.\n\n(8) At the conclusion of its review of the case, the Board shall make a written recommendation either to grant or to deny the waiver application.

The period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa is the period during which the alien may use it in making application for admission. The period of visa validity has no relation to the period of time the immigration authorities at a port of entry may authorize the alien to stay in the United States.\n\n(b) Validity of visa and number of applications for admission. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa shall have the validity prescribed in schedules provided to consular officers by the Department, reflecting insofar as practicable the reciprocal treatment accorded U.S. nationals, U.S. permanent residents, or aliens granted refugee status in the U.S. by the government of the country of which the alien is a national, permanent resident, refugee or stateless resident. \n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, United States nonimmigrant visas shall have a maximum validity period of 10 years. \n\n(3) An unexpired visa is valid for application for admission even if the passport in which the visa is stamped has expired, provided the alien is also in possession of a valid passport issued by the authorities of the country of which the alien is a national. \n\n(c) Limitation on validity. If warranted in an individual case, a consular officer may issue a nonimmigrant visa for:\n\n(1) A period of validity that is less than that prescribed on a basis of reciprocity,\n\n(2) A number of applications for admission within the period of the validity of the visa that is less than that prescribed on a basis of reciprocity,\n\n(3) Application for admission at a specified port or at specified ports of entry, or\n\n(4) Use on and after a given date subsequent to the date of issuance.\n\n(d) Automatic extension of validity at ports of entry. (1) Provided that the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section are fully met, the following provisions apply to nonimmigrant aliens seeking readmission at ports of entry:\n\n(i) The validity of an expired nonimmigrant visa issued under INA 101(a)(15) may be considered to be automatically extended to the date of application for readmission; and\n\n(ii) In cases where the original nonimmigrant classification of an alien has been changed by DHS to another nonimmigrant classification, the validity of an expired or unexpired nonimmigrant visa may be considered to be automatically extended to the date of application for readmission, and the visa may be converted as necessary to that changed classification.\n\n(2) The provisions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are applicable only in the case of a nonimmigrant alien who:\n\n(i) Is in possession of a Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, endorsed by DHS to show an unexpired period of initial admission or extension of stay, provided that in the case of a qualified F student or the accompanying spouse or child of such student, is in possession of a current Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, issued by the school that the student has been authorized to attend by DHS and endorsed by the issuing school official to indicate the period of initial admission or extension of stay authorized by DHS, and provided that in the case of a qualified J exchange visitor or the accompanying spouse or child of such exchange visitor, is in possession of a current Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status (J-NONIMMIGRANT), issued and endorsed by the Department of State-designated sponsor of the exchange program, to indicate the period of initial admission authorized by DHS or the extension of stay authorized by the Department of State;\n\n(ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory, or, in the case of a student or exchange visitor or accompanying spouse or child meeting the stipulations of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, after an absence not exceeding 30 days in contiguous territory or adjacent islands other than Cuba;\n\n(iii) Has maintained and intends to resume nonimmigrant status;\n\n(iv) Is applying for readmission within the authorized period of initial admission or extension of stay;\n\n(v) Is in possession of a valid passport;\n\n(vi) Does not require authorization for admission under INA 212(d)(3); and\n\n(vii) Has not applied for a new visa while abroad.\n\n(3) The provisions in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section shall not apply to the nationals of countries identified as supporting terrorism in the Department's annual report to Congress entitled Patterns of Global Terrorism.\n\n[52 FR 42597, Nov. 5, 1987; 53 FR 9112, 9172, Mar. 21, 1988, as amended at 55 FR 36028, Oct. 31, 1990; 62 FR 24332, May 5, 1997; 66 FR 38543, July 25, 2001; 67 FR 10323, Mar. 7, 2002; 67 FR 66046, Oct. 30, 2002; 86 FR 55693, Oct. 7, 2021]",

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa shall be evidenced by a physical visa placed in the alien's passport or by an electronic visa located in the Department's records. The appropriate symbol as prescribed in § 41.12, showing the classification of the alien, shall be entered on the visa.\n\n(b) Cases in which a physical visa is not placed in passport. In the following cases a physical visa shall be placed on the prescribed Form DS-232. In issuing such a visa, a notation shall be made on the Form DS-232 on which the visa is placed, specifying the pertinent subparagraph of this paragraph under which the action is taken.\n\n(1) The alien's passport was issued by a government with which the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations, unless the Department has specifically authorized the placing of the visa in such passport;\n\n(2) The passport requirement has been waived; or\n\n(3) In other cases as authorized by the Department.\n\n(c) Visa format. A machine-readable visa shall be in the format designated by the Department, and contain, at a minimum, the following data:\n\n(1) Full name of the applicant;\n\n(2) Visa type/class;\n\n(3) Location of the visa issuing office;\n\n(4) Passport number;\n\n(5) Sex;\n\n(6) Date of birth;\n\n(7) Nationality;\n\n(8) Number of applications for admission authorized, or the letter “M” for multiple applications for admission authorized;\n\n(9) Date of issuance;\n\n(10) Date of expiration;\n\n(11) Visa control number.\n\n(d) Insertion of name, petition, and derivative status notation.

If a nonimmigrant visa is issued for an unlimited number of applications for admission within the period of validity, the letter “M” shall be shown under the word “entries”. Otherwise the number of permitted applications for admission shall be identified numerically. The date of issuance and the date of expiration of the visa shall be shown at the appropriate places in the visa by day, month, and year in that order. The standard three letter abbreviation for the month shall be used in all cases.\n\n(f) Restriction to specified port(s) of entry. If a nonimmigrant visa is valid for admission only at one or more specified ports of entry, the names of those ports shall be entered in the annotation field. In cases where there is insufficient room to list the port(s) of entry, they shall be listed by hand on a clean passport page. Reference shall be made in the visa's annotation field citing the passport page upon which the port(s) of entry are listed.\n\n(g) Delivery of visa. In issuing a nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer should deliver the passport containing the visa, or the prescribed Form DS-232 which bears the visa, to the alien or to the alien's authorized representative. Any relevant evidence furnished by the alien in accordance with § 41.103(b) should be retained, as required or necessary.\n\n(h) Disposition of supporting documents. Original supporting documents furnished by the alien should be returned for presentation, if necessary, to the immigration authorities at the port of entry.

          "content": "§ 41.121   Refusal of nonimmigrant visas.\n(a) Grounds for refusal. Nonimmigrant visa refusals must be based on legal grounds, such as one or more provisions of INA 212(a), INA 212(e), INA 214(b) or (f) or (l) (as added by Section 625 of Pub. L. 104-208), INA 221(g), INA 222(g), or other applicable law. Certain classes of nonimmigrant aliens are exempted from specific provisions of INA 212(a) under INA 102 and, upon a basis of reciprocity, under INA 212(d)(8). When a visa application has been properly completed and executed in accordance with the provisions of the INA and the implementing regulations, the consular officer must issue the visa, refuse the visa, or, pursuant to an outstanding order under INA 243(d), discontinue granting the visa.\n\n(b) Refusal procedure. (1) When a consular officer knows or has reason to believe a visa applicant is ineligible and refuses the issuance of a visa, he or she must inform the alien of the ground(s) of ineligibility (unless disclosure is barred under INA 212(b)(2) or (3)) and whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal. The officer shall note the reason for the refusal on the application. Upon refusing the nonimmigrant visa, the consular officer shall retain the original of each document upon which the refusal was based, as well as each document indicating a possible ground of ineligibility, and should return all other supporting documents supplied by the applicant. \n\n(2) If an alien, who has not yet filed a visa application, seeks advice from a consular officer, who knows or has reason to believe that the alien is ineligible to receive a visa on grounds which cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the officer shall so inform the alien. The consular officer shall inform the applicant of the provision of law or regulations upon which a refusal of a visa, if applied for, would be based (subject to the exception in paragraph (b)(1) of this section). If practicable, the consular officer should request the alien to execute a nonimmigrant visa application in order to make a formal refusal. If the individual fails to execute a visa application in these circumstances, the consular officer shall treat the matter as if a visa had been refused and create a record of the presumed ineligibility which shall be filed in the consular office.\n\n(c) Nonimmigrant refusals must be reviewed, in accordance with guidance by the Secretary of State, by consular supervisors, or a designated alternate, to ensure compliance with laws and procedures. If the ground(s) of ineligibility upon which the visa was refused cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the refusal must be reviewed without delay; that is, on the day of the refusal or as soon as it is administratively possible. If the ground(s) of ineligibility may be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, and the applicant has indicated the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred for not more than 120 days. If the reviewing officer disagrees with the decision and he or she has a consular commission and title, the reviewing officer can assume responsibility and readjudicate the case. If the reviewing officer does not have a consular commission and title, he or she must consult with the adjudicating officer, or with the Visa Office, to resolve any disagreement.\n\n(d) Review of refusal by Department. The Department may request a consular officer in a specific case or in specified classes of cases to submit a report if a visa has been refused. The Department will review each report and may furnish an advisory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the officer believes that action contrary to an advisory opinion should be taken, the case shall be resubmitted to the Department with an explanation of the proposed action. Rulings of the Department concerning an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an application of the law to the facts, shall be binding upon consular officers.\n\n[52 FR 42597, Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 56 FR 30428, July 2, 1991; 63 FR 671, Jan. 7, 1998; 66 FR 10364, Feb. 15, 2001; 71 FR 50339, Aug. 25, 2006; 84 FR 16612, Apr. 22, 2019]",

A consular officer, the Secretary, or a Department official to whom the Secretary has delegated this authority is authorized to revoke a nonimmigrant visa at any time, in his or her discretion.\n\n(b) Provisional revocation—(1) General. A provisional revocation is subject to reversal through internal procedures established by the Department of State. Upon reversal of the revocation, the visa immediately resumes the validity provided for on its face. Provisional revocation shall have the same force and effect as any other visa revocation under INA 221(i), unless and until the revocation has been reversed. Neither the provisional revocation of a visa nor the reversal of a provisional revocation limits, in any way, the revocation authority provided for under INA 221(i), with respect to the particular visa or any other visa.\n\n(2) Pending visa eligibility determination. A consular officer, the Secretary, or any Department official to whom the Secretary has delegated this authority may provisionally revoke a nonimmigrant visa while considering information related to whether a visa holder is eligible for the visa.\n\n(3) Automatic provisional revocation based on failure to comply with all EVUS requirements. Visas held by individuals subject to the Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) who have not complied with the conditions described in 8 CFR 215.24 or whose notification of compliance has expired or been rescinded are automatically provisionally revoked and are no longer valid for travel to the United States, without further notice to the visa holder. The automatic provisional revocation pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3) shall be automatically reversed upon compliance with EVUS requirements set out at 8 CFR part 215, subpart B, as confirmed by receipt of a notification of compliance. A visa revoked on grounds other than failure to comply with EVUS shall remain revoked, notwithstanding compliance with EVUS.\n\n(c) Notice of revocation. Unless otherwise instructed by the Department, a consular officer shall, if practicable, notify the alien to whom the visa was issued that the visa was revoked or provisionally revoked. Regardless of delivery of such notice, once the revocation has been entered into the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), the visa is no longer to be considered valid for travel to the United States. The date of the revocation shall be indicated in CLASS and on any notice sent to the alien to whom the visa was issued. This paragraph (c) does not apply to provisional revocations under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.\n\n(d) Procedure for physically canceling visas. Except for provisional revocations pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a nonimmigrant visa that is revoked shall be canceled by writing or stamping the word “REVOKED” plainly across the face of the visa, if the visa is available to the consular officer. The failure or inability to physically cancel the visa does not affect the validity of the revocation.\n\n(e) Revocation of visa by immigration officer. An immigration officer is authorized to revoke a valid visa by physically canceling it in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this section if:\n\n(1) The alien obtains an immigrant visa or an adjustment of status to that of permanent resident;\n\n(2) The alien is ordered excluded from the United States under INA 236, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, or removed from the United States pursuant to INA 235;\n\n(3) The alien is notified pursuant to INA 235 by an immigration officer at a port of entry that the alien appears to be inadmissible to the United States, and the alien requests and is granted permission to withdraw the application for admission;\n\n(4) A final order of deportation or removal or a final order granting voluntary departure with an alternate order of deportation or removal is entered against the alien;\n\n(5) The alien has been permitted by DHS to depart voluntarily from the United States;\n\n(6) DHS has revoked a waiver of inadmissibility granted pursuant to INA 212(d)(3)(A) in relation to the visa that was issued to the alien;\n\n(7) The visa is presented in connection with an application for admission to the United States by a person other than the alien to whom the visa was issued;\n\n(8) The visa has been physically removed from the passport in which it was issued; or\n\n(9) The visa has been issued in a combined Mexican or Canadian B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing identification card, and the immigration officer makes the determination specified in § 41.32(c) with respect to the alien's Mexican citizenship and/or residence or the determination specified in § 41.33(b) with respect to the alien's status as a permanent resident of Canada.\n\n[76 FR 23479, Apr. 27, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 72523, Oct. 20, 2016]",

Consular officers in a country subject to an order by the Secretary under INA 243(d) shall discontinue granting nonimmigrant visas for categories of nonimmigrant visas specified in the order of the Secretary (or his or her designee), and pursuant to procedures dictated by the Department.\n\n(b) Discontinuance procedure—(1) Applications refused or discontinued only. Starting on the day the Secretary's (or designee's) order to discontinue granting visas takes effect (effective date), no visas falling within the scope of the order, as described by the order, may be issued in the referenced country to an applicant who falls within the scope of the order, except as otherwise expressly provided in the order or related Department instructions. Beginning on the effective date, a consular officer must refuse the visa if the individual is not eligible for the visa under INA 212(a), INA 221(g), or other applicable law, but if the applicant is otherwise eligible, must process the application by discontinuing granting, regardless of when the application was filed, if the applicant falls within the scope of the order and no exception applies. The application processing fee will not be refunded. The requirement to discontinue issuance may not be waived, and continues until the sanction is terminated as described below.\n\n(2) Geographic applicability. Visa sanctions under INA 243(d) only apply to visa issuance in the country that is sanctioned. If a consular officer has a reason to believe that a visa applicant potentially subject to INA 243(d) sanctions is applying at a post outside the sanctioned country to evade visa sanctions under INA 243(d) (e.g., the applicant provides no credible explanation for applying outside the country), the consular officer will transfer the case to the consular post in the consular district where INA 243(d) sanctions apply, review any other applicable Department instructions, and proceed accordingly. When cases are transferred to a consular district where INA 243(d) sanctions apply, the adjudication will be subject to the discontinuation of issuance under the sanctions.\n\n(c) Termination of sanction. The Department shall notify consular officers in an affected country when the sanction under INA 243(d) has been lifted. After notification, normal consular operations may resume consistent with these regulations and guidance from the Department. Once the sanction under INA 243(d) is lifted, no new application processing fee is required in cases where issuance has been discontinued pursuant to an INA 243(d) order, and consular officers in the affected post must adjudicate the visa consistent with regulations and Department guidance. Consular officers may require applicants to update the visa application forms, must conduct any necessary adjudicatory steps, and may re-interview the applicant to determine eligibility.\n\n\n\n[84 FR 16612, Apr. 22, 2019]",

          "content": "§ 42.24   Adoption under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption and the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000.\n(a) Except as described in paragraph (n), for purposes of this section, the definitions in 22 CFR 96.2 apply.\n\n(b) On or after the Convention effective date, as defined in 22 CFR 96.17, a child habitually resident in a Convention country who is adopted by a United States citizen deemed to be habitually resident in the United States in accordance with applicable DHS regulations must qualify for visa status under the provisions of INA section 101(b)(1)(G) as provided in this section. Such a child shall not be accorded status under INA section 101(b)(1)(F), provided that a child may be accorded status under INA section 101(b)(1)(F) if Form I-600A or I-600 was filed before the Convention effective date. Although this part 42 generally applies to the issuance of immigrant visas, this section 42.24 may also provide the basis for issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to permit a Convention adoptee to travel to the United States for purposes of naturalization under INA section 322.\n\n(c) The provisions of this section govern the operations of consular officers in processing cases involving children for whom classification is sought under INA section 101(b)(1)(G), unless the Secretary of State has personally waived any requirement of the IAA or these regulations in a particular case in the interests of justice or to prevent grave physical harm to the child, to the extent consistent with the Convention.\n\n(d) An alien child shall be classifiable under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) only if, before the child is adopted or legal custody for the purpose of adoption is granted, a petition for the child has been received and provisionally approved by a DHS officer or, where authorized by DHS, by a consular officer, and a visa application for the child has been received and annotated in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section by a consular officer. No alien child shall be issued a visa pursuant to INA section 101(b)(1)(G) unless the petition and visa application are finally approved.\n\n(e) If a petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is properly filed with a consular officer, the consular officer will review the petition for the purpose of determining whether it can be provisionally approved in accordance with applicable DHS requirements. If a properly completed application for waiver of inadmissibility is received by a consular officer at the same time that a petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is received, provisional approval cannot take place unless the waiver is approved, and therefore the consular officer, pursuant to 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3) and 8 CFR 212.7, will forward the petition and the waiver application to DHS for decisions as to approval of the waiver and provisional approval of the petition. If a petition for a child under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) is received by a DHS officer, the consular officer will conduct any reviews, determinations or investigations requested by DHS with regard to the petition and classification determination in accordance with applicable DHS procedures.\n\n(f) A petition shall be provisionally approved by the consular officer if, in accordance with applicable DHS requirements, it appears that the child will be classifiable under INA section 101(b)(1)(G) and that the proposed adoption or grant of legal custody will be in compliance with the Convention. If the consular officer knows or has reason to believe the petition is not provisionally approvable, the consular officer shall forward it to DHS pursuant to 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3).\n\n(g) After a petition has been provisionally approved, a completed visa application form, any supporting documents required pursuant to §§ 42.63 and 42.65, and any required fees must be submitted to the consular officer in accordance with § 42.61 for a provisional review of visa eligibility. The requirements in §§ 42.62, 42.64, 42.66 and 42.67 shall also be satisfied to the extent practicable.\n\n(h) A consular officer shall provisionally determine visa eligibility based on a review of the visa application, submitted supporting documents, and the provisionally approved petition. In so doing, the consular officer shall follow all procedures required to adjudicate the visa to the extent possible in light of the degree of compliance with §§ 42.62 through 42.67. If it appears, based on the available information, that the child would not be ineligible under INA section 212 or other applicable law to receive a visa, the consular officer shall so annotate the visa application. If evidence of an ineligibility is discovered during the review of the visa application, and the ineligibility was not waived in conjunction with provisional approval of the petition, the prospective adoptive parents shall be informed of the ineligibility and given an opportunity to establish that it will be overcome. If the visa application cannot be annotated as described above, the consular officer shall deny the visa in accordance with § 42.81, regardless of whether the application has yet been executed in accordance with § 42.67(a); provided however that, in cases in which a waiver may be available under the INA and the consular officer determines that the visa application appears otherwise approvable, the consular officer shall inform the prospective adoptive parents of the procedure for applying to DHS for a waiver. If in addition the consular officer comes to know or have reason to believe that the petition is not clearly approvable as provided in 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3), the consular officer shall forward the petition to DHS pursuant to that section.\n\n(i) If the petition has been provisionally approved and the visa application has been annotated in accordance with subparagraph (h), the consular officer shall notify the country of origin that the steps required by Article 5 of the Convention have been taken.\n\n(j) After the consular officer has received appropriate notification from the country of origin that the adoption or grant of legal custody has occurred and any remaining requirements established by DHS or §§ 42.61 through 42.67 have been fulfilled, the consular officer, if satisfied that the requirements of the IAA and the Convention have been met with respect to the adoption or grant of legal custody, shall affix to the adoption decree or grant of legal custody a certificate so indicating. This certificate shall constitute the certification required by IAA section 301(a) and INA section 204(d)(2). For purposes of determining whether to issue a certificate, the fact that a consular officer notified the country of origin pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section that the steps required by Article 5 of the Convention had been taken and the fact that the country of origin has provided appropriate notification that the adoption or grant of legal custody has occurred shall together constitute prima facie evidence of compliance with the Convention and the IAA.\n\n(k) If the consular officer is unable to issue the certificate described in paragraph (j) of this section, the consular officer shall notify the country of origin of the consular officer's decision.\n\n(l) After the consular officer determines whether to issue the certificate described in paragraph (j) of this section, the consular officer shall finally adjudicate the petition and visa application in accordance with standard procedures.\n\n(m) If the consular officer is unable to give final approval to the visa application or the petition, then the consular officer shall forward the petition to DHS, pursuant to § 42.43 or 8 CFR 204.313(i)(3), as applicable, for appropriate action in accordance with applicable DHS procedures, and/or refuse the visa application in accordance with § 42.81. The consular officer shall notify the country of origin that the visa has been refused.\n\n(n) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d) through (m) of this section, an alien described in paragraph (n)(1) of this section may qualify for visa status under INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(iii) without meeting the requirements set forth in paragraphs (d) through (m) of this section.\n\n(1) Per Section 4(b) of the Intercountry Adoption Simplification Act, Public Law 111-287 (IASA), an alien otherwise described in INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(iii) who attained the age of 18 on or after April 1, 2008 shall be deemed to meet the age requirement imposed by INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(iii)(III), provided that a petition is filed for such child in accordance with DHS requirements not later than November 30, 2012.\n\n(2) For any alien described in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, the “competent authority” referred to in INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(i)(V)(aa) is a court or governmental agency of a foreign country of origin having jurisdiction and authority to make decisions in matters of child welfare, including adoption. If the competent authority over matters of child welfare no longer has jurisdiction or authority over the alien due to his or her age, then the passport issuing authority of the country of origin may be considered the competent authority for the purposes of INA section 101(b)(1)(G)(i)(V)(aa).\n\n[72 FR 61305, Oct. 30, 2007, as amended at 76 FR 67363, Nov. 1, 2011; 78 FR 32990, June 3, 2013]",

Pursuant to INA 203(d), and whether or not named in the petition, the spouse or child of an employment-based fifth preference immigrant, if not otherwise entitled to an immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a visa, is entitled to a derivative status corresponding to the classification and priority date of the beneficiary of the petition. \n\n[56 FR 49676, Oct. 1, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 51172, Oct. 10, 1991; 56 FR 55077, Oct. 24, 1991; 60 FR 35839, July 12, 1995; 63 FR 4394, Jan. 29, 1998; 63 FR 68393, Dec. 11, 1998; 65 FR 80745, Dec. 22, 2000; 66 FR 15350, Mar. 19, 2001; 68 FR 24639, May 8, 2003; 85 FR 36326, June 16, 2020]",

          "content": "§ 42.33   Diversity immigrants.\n(a) General—(1) Eligibility to compete for consideration under section 203(c). An alien will be eligible to compete for consideration for visa issuance under INA 203(c) during a fiscal year only if he or she is a native of a low-admission foreign state, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to INA 203(c)(1)(E), with respect to the fiscal year in question; and if he or she has at least a high school education or its equivalent or, within the five years preceding the date of application for a visa, has two years of work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years training or experience. The eligibility for a visa under INA 203(c) ceases at the end of the fiscal year in question. Under no circumstances may a consular officer issue a visa or other documentation to an alien after the end of the fiscal year during which an alien possesses diversity visa eligibility.\n\n(2) Definition of high school education or its equivalent. For the purposes of this section, the phrase high school education or its equivalent means the successful completion of a twelve-year course of elementary and secondary education in the United States or successful completion in another country of a formal course of elementary and secondary education comparable to completion of twelve years' elementary and secondary education in the United States.\n\n(3) Determinations of work experience. For all cases registered for the 2003 Diversity Visa Program and Diversity Visa Programs occurring in subsequent fiscal years, consular officers must use the Department of Labor's O*Net On Line to determine qualifying work experience.\n\n(4) Limitation on number of petitions per year. No more than one petition may be submitted by or on behalf of, any alien for consideration during any single fiscal year. If two or more petitions for any single fiscal year are submitted by, or on behalf of, any alien, all such petitions will be void pursuant to INA 204(a)(1)(I)(i) and the alien by or for whom the petition has been submitted will not be eligible for consideration for diversity visa issuance during the fiscal year in question. \n\n(5) Northern Ireland. For purposes of determining eligibility to file a petition for consideration under INA 203(c) for a fiscal year, the districts comprising that portion of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, known as “Northern Ireland”, will be treated as a separate foreign state. The districts comprising “Northern Ireland” are Antrim, Ards, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Castlereagh, Coleraine, Cookstown, Craigavon, Down, Dungannon, Fermanagh, Larne, Limavady, Lisburn, Londonderry, Magherafelt, Moyle, Newry and Mourne, Newtownabbey, North Down, Omagh, and Strabane. \n\n(b) Petition requirement. An alien claiming to be entitled to compete for consideration under INA 203(c) must file a petition with the Department of State for such consideration. At the alien petitioner's request, another person may file a petition on behalf of the alien. The petition will consist of an electronic entry form that the alien petitioner or a person acting on the behalf of the alien petitioner must complete on-line and submit to the Department of State via a Web site established by the Department of State for the purpose of receiving such petitions. The Department will specify the address of the Web site prior to the commencement of the 30-day or greater period described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section using the notice procedure prescribed in that paragraph.\n\n(1) Information to be provided in the petition. The website will include the electronic entry form mentioned in paragraph (b) of this section. The entry form will require the person completing the form to provide the following information, typed in the Roman alphabet, regarding the alien petitioner:\n\n(i) The petitioner's full name; \n\n(ii) The petitioner's date and place of birth (including city and country, province or other political subdivision of the country); \n\n(iii) The petitioner's gender; \n\n(iv) The country of which the petitioner claims to be a native, if other than the country of birth; \n\n(v) The name[s], date[s] and place[s] of birth and gender of the petitioner's spouse and child[ren], if any, (including legally adopted and step-children), regardless of whether or not they are living with the petitioner or intend to accompany or follow to join the petitioner should the petitioner immigrate to the United States pursuant to INA 203(c), but excluding a spouse or a child[ren] who is already a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident; \n\n(vi) A current mailing address for the petitioner; \n\n(vii) The location of the consular office nearest to the petitioner's current residence or, if in the United States, nearest to the petitioner's last foreign residence prior to entry into the United States.\n\n\n\n(2) Requirements for photographs. The petition will also require inclusion of a photograph of the petitioner and of his or her spouse and all unmarried children under the age of 21 years. The photographs must meet the following specifications:\n\n(i) A digital image of the applicant from either a digital camera source or a scanned photograph via scanner. If scanned, the original photographic print must have been 2″ by 2″ (50mm × 50mm). Scanner hardware and digital image resolution requirements will be further specified in the public notice described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. \n\n(ii) The image must be in the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) File Interchange Format (JFIF) format. \n\n(iii) The image must be in color.\n\n(iv) The image must have been taken no more than six months prior to the date of the petition submission.\n\n(v) The person being photographed must be directly facing the camera with the head neither tilted up, down, or to the side. The head must cover about 50% of the area of the photograph. \n\n(vi) The photograph must be taken with the person in front of a neutral, light-colored background. Photos taken with very dark or patterned, busy backgrounds will not be accepted. \n\n(vii) The person's face must be in focus. \n\n(viii) The person in the photograph must not wear eyeglasses, sunglasses, or other paraphernalia that obstruct the view of the face.\n\n(ix) A photograph with the person wearing a head covering or a hat is only acceptable if the covering or hat is worn specifically due to that person's religious beliefs, and even then, the hat or covering may not obscure any portion of the face. A photograph of a person wearing tribal, military, airline or other headgear not specifically religious in nature will not be accepted. \n\n(3) Submission of petition. A petition for consideration for visa issuance under INA 203(c) must be submitted to the Department of State by electronic entry to an Internet website designated by the Department for that purpose. No fee will be collected at the time of submission of a petition, but a processing fee may be collected at a later date, as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. The Department will establish a period of not less than thirty days during each fiscal year within which aliens may submit petitions for approval of eligibility to apply for visa issuance during the following fiscal year. Each fiscal year the Department will give timely notice of both the website address and the exact dates of the petition submission period, as well as other pertinent information, through publication in the Federal Register and such other methods as will ensure the widest possible dissemination of the information, both abroad and within the United States.\n\n(c) Processing of petitions. Entries received during the petition submission period established for the fiscal year in question and meeting all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section will be assigned a number in a separate numerical sequence established for each regional area specified in INA 203(c)(1)(F). Upon completion of the numbering of all petitions, all numbers assigned for each region will be separately rank-ordered at random by a computer using standard computer software for that purpose. The Department will then select in the rank orders determined by the computer program a quantity of petitions for each region estimated to be sufficient to ensure, to the extent possible, usage of all immigrant visas authorized under INA 203(c) for the fiscal year in question. The Department will consider petitions selected in this manner to have been approved for the purposes of this section. \n\n(d) Validity of approved petitions. A petition approved pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be valid for a period not to exceed Midnight of the last day of the fiscal year for which the petition was approved. At that time, the Department of State will consider approval of the petition to cease to be valid pursuant to INA 204(a)(1)(I)(ii)(II), which prohibits issuance of visas based upon petitions submitted and approved for a fiscal year after the last day of that fiscal year.\n\n(e) Order of consideration. Consideration for visa issuance to aliens whose petitions have been approved pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be in the regional rank orders established pursuant that paragraph.\n\n(f) Allocation of visa numbers. To the extent possible, diversity immigrant visa numbers will be allocated in accordance with INA 203(c)(1)(E) and will be allotted only during the fiscal year for which a petition to accord diversity immigrant status was submitted and approved. Under no circumstances will immigrant visa numbers be allotted after midnight of the last day of the fiscal year for which the petition was submitted and approved.\n\n(g) Further processing. The Department will inform applicants whose petitions have been approved pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section of the steps necessary to meet the requirements of INA 222(b) in order to apply formally for an immigrant visa.\n\n(h) Maintenance of certain information. (1) The Department will compile and maintain the following information concerning petitioners to whom immigrant visas are issued under INA 203(c):\n\n(i) Age;\n\n(ii) Country of birth;\n\n(iii) Marital status;\n\n(iv) Sex;\n\n(v) Level of education; and\n\n(vi) Occupation and level of occupational qualification.\n\n(2) The Department will not maintain the names of visa recipients in connection with this information and the information will be compiled and maintained in such form that the identity of visa recipients cannot be determined therefrom.\n\n(i) Diversity Visa Lottery fee. Consular officers shall collect, or ensure the collection of, the Diversity Visa Lottery fee from those persons who apply for a diversity immigrant visa, described in INA 203(c), after being selected by the diversity visa lottery program. The Diversity Visa Lottery fee, as prescribed by the Secretary of State, is set forth in the Schedule of Fees, 22 CFR 22.1.\n\n[68 FR 49355, Aug. 18, 2003, as amended at 73 FR 7670, Feb. 11, 2008; 77 FR 18914, Mar. 29, 2012; 81 FR 63695, Sept. 16, 2016; 84 FR 25991, June 5, 2019; 87 FR 35415, June 10, 2022]",

          "content": "§ 42.34   Special immigrant visas-certain U.S. Government employees.\n(a) General. An applicant is classifiable under INA 203(b)(4) as a special immigrant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) provided:\n\n(1) (i) The applicant has performed faithful service to the United States Government abroad, or the American Institute in Taiwan, for a total of fifteen years or more; or\n\n(ii) The applicant is the surviving spouse or child of an employee of the United States Government abroad who performed faithful service for a total of not less than 15 years or was killed in the line of duty; and\n\n(2) The principal officer of a Foreign Service establishment (or, in the case of the American Institute in Taiwan, the Director), recommends granting special immigrant status to such person in exceptional circumstances; and\n\n(3) The Secretary of State, or designee, approves such recommendation and finds that it is in the national interest to grant such status.\n\n(b) Petition requirement. An applicant who seeks classification as a special immigrant described in paragraph (a) of this section must file a Form DS-1884, Petition to Classify Special Immigrant under INA 203(b)(4) as an Employee or Former Employee of the U.S. Government Abroad, or the Surviving Spouse or Child of an Employee of the U.S. Government Abroad, with the Department of State. An applicant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) may file such a petition only after, but within one year of, notification from the Department that the Secretary of State or designee has approved a recommendation from the principal officer that special immigrant status be accorded the applicant in exceptional circumstances and has found it in the national interest to do so.\n\n(1) Petition fees. The Secretary of State shall establish a fee for the filing of a petition to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) which shall be collected following notification that the Secretary of State, or designee, has approved the recommendation that the applicant be granted status as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D).\n\n(2) Establishing priority date. The priority date of an applicant seeking status under INA 203(b)(4) as a special immigrant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) shall be the date on which the petition to accord such classification, the DS-1884, is filed. The filing date of the petition is the date on which a properly completed form and the required fee are accepted by a Foreign Service post. Pursuant to INA 203(d), and whether named in the petition, the current spouse or child who meets the definition of “child” under INA 101(b)(1) of an applicant classified under INA 203(b)(4), if not otherwise entitled to an immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a visa, is entitled to the classification and priority date of the beneficiary of the petition.\n\n(3) Delegation of authority to approve petitions. The authority to approve petitions to accord status under INA 203(b)(4) to an applicant described in INA 101(a)(27)(D) is hereby delegated to the chief consular officer at the post of recommendation or, in the absence of the consular officer, to any alternate approving officer designated by the principal officer. Such authority may not be exercised until the Foreign Service post has received formal notification of the Secretary of State or designee's approval of special immigrant status for the petitioning applicant.\n\n(4) Petition validity. Except as noted in this paragraph, the validity of a petition approved for classification under INA 203(b)(4) shall be six months beyond the date of the Secretary of State's approval thereof or the availability of a visa number, whichever is later.\n\n(5) Extension of special immigrant status and petition validity. If the principal officer of a post concludes that circumstances in a particular case are such that an extension of validity of the Secretary of State or designee's approval of the principal officer's recommendation or of the petition would be in the national interest, the principal officer shall recommend to the Secretary of State or designee that such validity be extended for not more than one additional year.\n\n(c) Definitions—(1) Full-time service. Where 15 years of service is the minimum time required for eligibility for a special immigrant visa, the employee must have been employed for a total of at least 15 full-time years, or the equivalent thereof, in the service of the U.S. Government abroad. The number of hours per week that qualify an employee as full-time is dependent on local law and prevailing practice in the country where the individual is or was employed, as reflected in the employment documentation submitted with the application for special immigrant status. The years of service may be met based on employment abroad with one, or more than one, agency of the U.S. Government provided the total amount of full-time service with the U.S. Government is 15 years or more, or the equivalent thereof.\n\n(2) Faithful service. Where faithful service is required for eligibility for a special immigrant visa, an employee must have performed faithfully in the position held. The principal officer has the primary responsibility for determining whether the employee's service meets this requirement. A record of disciplinary actions that have been taken against the employee does not automatically disqualify the applicant. The principal officer must assess the record of disciplinary actions considering the extent and gravity of the misconduct and when the incidents occurred, and determine whether the record as a whole, notwithstanding disciplinary actions, is one of faithful service.\n\n(3) Continuity. Where 15 years of service is the minimum time required for eligibility for a special immigrant visa, the employee's period of service need not have been continuous but must have an aggregate total of 15 years of service to qualify.\n\n(4) Abroad. The service must have occurred anywhere outside the United States, as the term “United States” is defined in INA 101(a)(38).\n\n(5) Employment at the American Institute in Taiwan. INA 101(a)(27)(D) permits both present and former employees of the American Institute in Taiwan to apply for special immigrant status. An employee's service before and after the founding of the American Institute in Taiwan is counted toward the minimum 15 years of service requirement.\n\n(6) Honorably retired. Separations within the meaning of “honorably retired” include, for example, those resulting from mandatory or voluntary retirement, reduction-in-force, or resignation for personal reasons. Separations not within the meaning of “honorably retired” would include a termination for cause or an involuntary termination or resignation in lieu of a termination for cause.\n\n(7) Exceptional circumstances for employees of the United States Government abroad. For classification as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D)(i), the principal officer must determine that an employee demonstrates at least one form of “exceptional circumstances” to support an application for special immigrant status.\n\n(i) Prima facie indicators of exceptional circumstances. In the following situations, an employee's service with the U.S. Government generally will be deemed to have met exceptional circumstances.\n\n(A) Diplomatic relations between the employee's country of nationality and the United States have been severed;\n\n(B) Diplomatic relations between the country in which the employee was employed and the United States have been severed;\n\n(C) The country in which the employee was employed and the United States have strained relations and the employee may be subjected to retribution by the local, State, Federal, or other official government body merely because of association with the U.S. Government, or the employee may be pressured to divulge information contrary to U.S. national interests; or\n\n(D) The employee was hired at the Consulate General at Hong Kong on or before July 1, 1999.\n\n(ii) Strong indicators of exceptional circumstances. (A) It is believed that continued service to the U.S. Government might endanger the life of the employee;\n\n(B) The employee has fulfilled responsibilities or given service in a manner that approaches the heroic;\n\n(C) The employee has been awarded a global or a regional “Foreign Service National of the Year” Award;\n\n(D) The employee has disclosed waste, fraud or abuse, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation within the Department or other U.S. Government agency, if such disclosure results in significant action by the Department or other U.S. Government agency against an offending party, such as termination or severance of a contractual relationship, or criminal charges against any person or entity.\n\n(E) The employee has served the U.S. Government for a period of twenty years or more.\n\n(8) Exceptional circumstances for surviving spouses and children. For classification as a special immigrant under INA 101(a)(27)(D)(ii), the principal officer must determine that the deceased employee:\n\n(i) Was killed in the line of duty; or\n\n(ii) Performed faithful service to the United States Government abroad for a total of not less than 15 years; and\n\n(A) Was employed by the U.S. Government as of the date of their death or in the immediately preceding period as defined in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, or\n\n(B) Was an honorably retired former employee who, prior to their death, demonstrated at least one form of “exceptional circumstances” as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.\n\n(9) Immediately preceding period. (i) As provided in paragraph (c)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, a deceased employee is considered to have been employed by the U.S. Government in the period immediately preceding their death if such employment ceased due to circumstances that resulted in their death.\n\n(ii) A deceased employee is presumed to not meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(8)(ii)(A) of this section if the employee's death occurred more than five years following cessation of employment. This presumption can be rebutted if the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the principal officer, that the employment ceased due to circumstances that resulted in the employee's death, and the Secretary or appropriate designee finds it in the national interest to grant such status. The principal officer has the primary responsibility for determining whether the applicant meets this criterion, taking into consideration as informed by the circumstances of the cessation of employment, the cause of the employee's death as documented by the applicant, and other relevant evidence the applicant presents that demonstrates that the cessation of employment was for reasons that ultimately resulted in the employee's death.\n\n(10) Immediate intent to immigrate. (i) The recommendation of the principal officer must certify that the applicant being recommended is prepared to file a petition within one year of the Department's notification to the post of approval of special immigrant status, and to pursue an immigrant visa application within six months of the Secretary of State's approval of the petition or of an immigrant visa becoming available, whichever is later. If the applicant is an employee who is not yet honorably retired, the recommendation must also certify that the employee intends permanent separation from U.S. Government employment abroad no later than the date of departure for the United States following issuance of an immigrant visa.\n\n(ii) Employees of Hong Kong Consulate General hired on or before July 1, 1999, are not required to establish immediate intent to immigrate. Employees of the Hong Kong Consulate General who received or were approved for special immigrant status before July 1, 1999, also may continue employment with the U.S. Government.\n\n\n\n[89 FR 99079, Dec. 10, 2024]",

(1) A record that an alien is entitled to an immigrant visa classification shall be made whenever the consular officer is satisfied—or receives evidence—that the alien is within the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(2) A separate record shall be made of family members entitled to derivative immigrant status whenever the consular officer determines that a spouse or child is chargeable to a different foreign state or other numerical limitation than the principal alien. The provisions of INA 202(b) are to be applied as appropriate when either the spouse or parent is reached on the waiting list. \n\n(3) A separate record shall be made of a spouse or child entitled to derivative immigrant status whenever the consular officer determines that the principal alien intends to precede the family. \n\n[56 FR 51174, Oct. 9, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 1836, Jan. 24, 1996; 78 FR 31399, May 24, 2013]",

An alien applying for an immigrant visa shall be required to furnish, if obtainable: A copy of a police certificate or certificates; a certified copy of any existing prison record, military record, and record of birth; and a certified copy of all other records or documents which the consular officer considers necessary.\n\n(c) Definitions.

In the case of the country of an alien's nationality and the country of an alien's current residence (as of the time of visa application) the term “appropriate police authorities” means those of a country, area or locality in which the alien has resided for at least six months. In the case of all other countries, areas, or localities, the term “appropriate police authorities” means the authorities of any country, area, or locality in which the alien has resided for at least one year.

A certificate of discharge from the military forces or an enrollment book belonging to the applicant shall not be acceptable in lieu of the official military record, unless it shows the alien's complete record while in military service. The applicant may, however, be required to present for inspection such a discharge certificate or enrollment book if deemed necessary by the consular officer to establish the applicant's eligibility to receive a visa.\n\n(4) A certified copy of an alien's record of birth means a certificate issued by the official custodian of birth records in the country of birth showing the date and place of birth and the parentage of the alien, based upon the original registration of birth.\n\n(5) Other records or documents include any records or documents establishing the applicant's relationship to a spouse or children, if any, and any records or documents pertinent to a determination of the applicant's identity, classification, or any other matter relating to the applicant's visa eligibility.\n\n(d) Unobtainable documents. (1) If the consular officer is satisfied, or the catalogue of available documents prepared by the Department indicates, that any document or record required under this section is unobtainable, the officer may permit the immigrant to submit other satisfactory evidence in lieu of such document or record. A document or other record shall be considered unobtainable if it cannot be procured without causing to the applicant or a family member actual hardship as opposed to normal delay and inconvenience.\n\n(2) If the consular officer determines that a supporting document, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, is in fact unobtainable, although the catalogue of available documents shows it is available, the officer shall affix to the visa application a signed statement describing in detail the reasons for considering the record or document unobtainable and for accepting the particular secondary evidence attached to the visa. \n\n(e) Authenticity of records and documents.

The fee must be paid before an applicant at a post so designated will receive an appointment to appear and make application before a consular officer. Applicants at a post not yet so designated will pay the fee immediately prior to formal application for a visa. A fee collected for the processing of an immigrant visa application is refundable only if the principal officer of a post or the officer in charge of a consular section determines that the application was not adjudicated as a result of action by the U.S. Government over which the alien had no control and for which the alien was not responsible, which precluded the applicant from benefitting from the processing, or as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) Waiver or refund of fees for replacement immigrant visas for adoptees.

A consular officer may issue a replacement visa under the original number of a qualified alien entitled to status as an immediate relative (INA 201(b)(2)), a family or employment preference immigrant (INA 203(a) or (b)), or a diversity immigrant (INA 203(c)), if—\n\n(1) The alien is unable to use the visa during the period of its validity due to reasons beyond the alien's control;\n\n(2) The visa is issued during the same fiscal year in which the original visa was issued, or in the following year in the case of an immediate relative only, if the original number had been reported as recaptured;\n\n(3) The number has not been returned to the Department as a “recaptured visa number” in the case of a preference or diversity immigrant;\n\n(4) The alien pays anew the application processing fees prescribed in the Schedule of Fees; and\n\n(5) The consular officer ascertains whether the original issuing office knows of any reason why a new visa should not be issued.\n\n(c) Replacement visa for adoptees.

          "content": "§ 42.81   Procedure in refusing immigrant visas.\n(a) Grounds for refusal. When a visa application has been properly completed and executed before a consular officer in accordance with the provisions of the INA and the implementing regulations, the consular officer must issue the visa, refuse the visa under INA 212(a) or 221(g) or other applicable law or, pursuant to an outstanding order under INA 243(d), discontinue granting the visa.\n\n\n\n(b) Refusal procedure. A consular officer may not refuse an immigrant visa until either Form DS-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, or Form DS-260, Electronic Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, has been executed by the applicant. When an immigrant visa is refused, an appropriate record shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed by the Department. The form shall be signed and dated by the consular officer. The consular officer shall inform the applicant of the provision of law or implementing regulation on which the refusal is based and of any statutory provision of law or implementing regulation under which administrative relief is available. Each document related to the refusal shall then be attached to Form DS-230 for retention in the refusal files. Alternatively, each document related to the refusal shall be electronically scanned and electronically attached to Form DS-260 for retention in the electronic refusal files. Any documents not related to the refusal shall be returned to the applicant. The original copy of a document that was scanned and attached to the DS-260 for the refusal file shall be returned to the applicant. If the ground of ineligibility may be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence and the applicant indicates an intention to submit such evidence, all documents may, with the consent of the alien, be retained in the consular files for a period not to exceed one year. If the refusal as not been overcome within one year, any documents not relating to the refusal shall be removed from the file and returned to the alien.\n\n(c) Review of refusal at consular office. If the grounds of ineligibility upon which the visa was refused cannot be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence, the principal consular officer at a post, or a specifically designated alternate, shall review the case without delay, record the review decision, and sign and date the prescribed form. If the grounds of ineligibility may be overcome by the presentation of additional evidence and the applicant indicates the intention to submit such evidence, a review of the refusal may be deferred. If the principal consular officer or alternate does not concur in the refusal, that officer shall either (1) refer the case to the Department for an advisory opinion, or (2) assume responsibility for final action on the case. \n\n(d) Review of refusal by Department. The Department may request a consular officer in an individual case or in specified classes of cases to submit a report if an immigrant visa has been refused. The Department will review each report and may furnish an advisory opinion to the consular officer for assistance in considering the case further. If the officer believes that action contrary to an advisory opinion should be taken, the case shall be resubmitted to the Department with an explanation of the proposed action. Rulings of the Department concerning an interpretation of law, as distinguished from an application of the law to the facts, are binding upon consular officers. \n\n(e) Reconsideration of refusal. If a visa is refused, and the applicant within one year from the date of refusal adduces further evidence tending to overcome the ground of ineligibility on which the refusal was based, the case shall be reconsidered. In such circumstance, an additional application fee shall not be required. \n\n[52 FR 42613, Nov. 5, 1987; 53 FR 9112, Mar. 21, 1988, as amended at 66 FR 10364, Feb. 15, 2001; 71 FR 34522, June 15, 2006; 75 FR 45477, Aug. 3, 2010; 84 FR 16612, Apr. 22, 2019]",

A consular officer, the Secretary, or any Department official to whom the Secretary has delegated this authority may provisionally revoke an immigrant visa while considering information related to whether a visa holder is eligible for the visa. Provisional revocation shall have the same force and effect as any other visa revocation under INA 221(i).\n\n(c) Notice of revocation. Unless otherwise instructed by the Department, a consular officer shall, if practicable, notify the alien to whom the visa was issued that the visa was revoked or provisionally revoked. Regardless of delivery of such notice, once the revocation has been entered into the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), the visa is no longer to be considered valid for travel to the United States. The date of the revocation shall be indicated in CLASS and on any notice sent to the alien to whom the visa was issued.\n\n(d) Procedure for physically canceling visas. An immigrant visa that is revoked shall be canceled by writing or stamping the word “REVOKED” plainly across the face of the visa, if the visa is available to the consular officer.

In accordance with INA 203(g), an alien's registration for an immigrant visa shall be terminated if, within one year after transmission of a notification of the availability of an immigrant visa, the applicant fails to apply for an immigrant visa.\n\n(b) Termination following visa refusal. An alien's registration for an immigrant visa shall be terminated if, within one year following the refusal of the immigrant visa application under INA 221(g), the alien has failed to present to a consular officer evidence purporting to overcome the basis for refusal. \n\n(c) Notice of termination. Upon the termination of registration under paragraph (a) of this section, the National Visa Center (NVC) shall notify the alien of the termination. The NVC shall also inform the alien of the right to have the registration reinstated if the alien, before the end of the second year after the missed appointment date if paragraph (a) applies, establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer at the post where the alien is registered that the failure to apply for an immigrant visa was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control. If paragraph (b) applies, the consular officer at the post where the alien is registered shall, upon the termination of registration, notify the alien of the termination and the right to have the registration reinstated if the alien, before the end of the second year after the INA 221(g) refusal, establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer at such post that the failure to present evidence purporting to overcome the ineligibility under INA 221(g) was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control.\n\n(d) Reinstatement of registration. If the consular officer is satisfied that an alien, as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, has established that failure to apply as scheduled for an immigrant visa or to present evidence purporting to overcome ineligibility under INA 221(g) was due to circumstances beyond the alien's control, the consular officer shall reinstate the alien's registration for an immigrant visa. Any petition approved under INA 204(b) which had been automatically revoked as a result of the termination of registration shall be considered to be automatically reinstated if the registration is reinstated. \n\n(e) Interpretation of “circumstances beyond alien's control”. For the purpose of this section, the term “circumstances beyond the alien's control” includes, but is not limited to, an illness or other physical disability preventing the alien from traveling, a refusal by the authorities of the country of an alien's residence to grant the alien permission to depart as an immigrant, and foreign military service.\n\n[52 FR 42613, Nov. 5, 1987, as amended at 56 FR 49682, Oct. 1, 1991; 73 FR 11028, Feb. 29, 2008]",

          "content": "§ 42.84   Discontinuance of granting immigrant visa pursuant to INA 243(d).\n(a) Grounds for discontinuance of granting a visa. Consular officers in a country subject to an order by the Secretary under INA 243(d) shall discontinue granting immigrant visas for categories of immigrant visas specified in the order of the Secretary (or his or her designee), and pursuant to procedures dictated by the Department.\n\n(b) Discontinuance procedure—(1) Applications refused or discontinued only. Starting on the day the Secretary's (or designee's) order to discontinue granting visas takes effect (effective date), no visas falling within the scope of the order, as described by the order, may be issued in the referenced country to an applicant who falls within the scope of the order, except as otherwise expressly provided in the order or related Department instructions. Beginning on the effective date, a consular officer must refuse the visa if the individual is not eligible for the visa under INA 212(a), INA 221(g), or other applicable law, but if the applicant is otherwise eligible must process the application by discontinuing granting, regardless of when the application was filed, if the applicant falls within the scope of the order and no exception applies. The application processing fee will not be refunded. The requirement to discontinue issuance may not be waived, and continues until the sanction is terminated as described below. In the case of diversity immigrant selectees applying under INA 203(c), if the discontinuance of granting has not been lifted by the end of the fiscal year, the applicant will not be eligible for a diversity visa for that fiscal year, regardless of the status of the diversity immigrant visa application at the time 243(d) sanctions were imposed.\n\n(2) Geographic applicability. Visa sanctions under INA 243(d) only apply to visa issuance in the country that is sanctioned. If a consular officer has a reason to believe that a visa applicant potentially subject to INA 243(d) sanctions is applying at a post outside the sanctioned country to evade visa sanctions under INA 243(d), (e.g., the applicant provides no credible explanation for applying outside the country) the consular officer will transfer the case to the consular post in the consular district where INA 243(d) sanctions apply, review any other applicable Department instructions and proceed accordingly. When cases are transferred to a consular district where INA 243(d) sanctions apply, the adjudication will be subject to the discontinuation of issuance under the sanctions.\n\n(c) Termination of sanction. The Department shall notify consular officers in an affected country the sanction under INA 243(d) has been lifted. After notification, normal consular operations may resume consistent with these regulations and guidance from the Department. Once the sanction under INA 243(d) is lifted, no new application processing fees are required in cases where issuance has been discontinued pursuant to an INA 243(d) order, and consular officers in the affected post must adjudicate the visa application consistent with regulations and Department guidance. Consular officers may require applicants to update the visa application forms, must conduct any necessary adjudicatory steps, and may re-interview to determine eligibility. In numerically controlled immigrant visa categories, an applicant's immigrant visa priority date may no longer be current once sanctions under INA 243(d) are lifted, in which case the applicant must await visa availability.\n\n[84 FR 16613, Apr. 22, 2019]",

          "content": "§ 50.40   Certification of loss of U.S. nationality.\n(a) Administrative presumption. In adjudicating potentially expatriating acts pursuant to INA 349(a), the Department has adopted an administrative presumption regarding certain acts and the intent to commit them. U.S. citizens who naturalize in a foreign country; take a routine oath of allegiance; or accept non-policy level employment with a foreign government need not submit evidence of intent to retain U.S. nationality. In these three classes of cases, intent to retain U.S. citizenship will be presumed. A person who affirmatively asserts to a consular officer, after he or she has committed a potentially expatriating act, that it was his or her intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship will lose his or her U.S. citizenship. In other loss of nationality cases, the consular officer will ascertain whether or not there is evidence of intent to relinquish U.S. nationality.\n\n(b) Whenever a person admits that he or she had the intent to relinquish citizenship by the voluntary and intentional performance of one of the acts specified in Section 349(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the person consents to the execution of an affidavit to that effect, the diplomatic or consular officer shall attach such affidavit to the certificate of loss of nationality.\n\n(c) Whenever a diplomatic or consular officer has reason to believe that a person, while in a foreign country, has lost his U.S. nationality under any provision of chapter 3 of title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, or under any provision of chapter IV of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, he shall prepare a certificate of loss of nationality containing the facts upon which such belief is based and shall forward the certificate to the Department.\n\n(d) If the diplomatic or consular officer determines that any document containing information relevant to the statements in the certificate of loss of nationality should not be attached to the certificate, the person may summarize the pertinent information in the appropriate section of the certificate and send the documents together with the certificate to the Department.\n\n(e) If the certificate of loss of nationality is approved by the Department, a copy shall be forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice. The diplomatic or consular office in which the certificate was prepared shall then forward a copy of the certificate to the person to whom it relates or his representative.\n\n(f) Attorney or Other Third-Party Presence at In-Person CLN appointments. Individuals may, at their own expense, have a private attorney, interpreter, or other third party of their own choice physically present during any in-person appointment, including interview appointments, at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad related to a request for a Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN); provided that:\n\n(1) The individual and/or the attorney or other third party shall provide advance notice of the attorney's or other third party's intent to attend the CLN appointment in the manner specified by the Department of State and/or the specific U.S. embassy or consulate where the appointment is to take place;\n\n(2) The individual requesting the CLN must appear in person for the mandatory in-person interview appointment(s); attendance by an attorney or other third party shall not be in lieu of the individual's in-person appearance;\n\n(3) The diplomatic or consular officer will direct all interview questions to the individual requesting the CLN, and the individual must personally respond to the consular officer;\n\n(4) The diplomatic or consular officer conducting the interview shall have the discretion to interview the individual alone, without an attorney or third-party present, when necessary to evaluate whether the individual has performed a potentially expatriating act independently, free from duress or coercion, and with intent to relinquish U.S. nationality;\n\n(5) Nothing in this section abrogates any policies, security directives, and guidelines from the Department, Chief of Mission, or Diplomatic Security Service regarding admission to or conduct in the U.S. embassy or consulate.

Nevertheless, the Department may in its discretion review determinations of loss of nationality at any time after approval of issuance of the Certificate of Loss of Nationality to ensure consistency with governing law (see INA §§ 349 and 356, 8 U.S.C. 1481 and 1488). Such reconsideration may be initiated at the request of the person concerned or another person determined in accordance with guidance issued by the Department to have a legitimate interest.\n\n(b) The primary grounds on which the Department will consider reversing a finding of loss of nationality and vacating a Certificate of Loss of Nationality are:\n\n(1) The law under which the finding of loss was made has been held unconstitutional; or\n\n(2) A major change in the interpretation of the law of expatriation is made as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision; or\n\n(3) A major change in the interpretation of the law of expatriation is made by the Department, or is made by a court or another agency and adopted by the Department; and/or\n\n(4) The person presents substantial new evidence, not previously considered, of involuntariness or absence of intent at the time of the expatriating act.\n\n(c) When the Department reverses a finding of loss of nationality, the person concerned shall be considered not to have lost U.S. nationality as of the time the expatriating act was committed, and the Certificate of Loss of Nationality shall be vacated.\n\n(d) Requesting the Department to reverse a finding of loss of nationality and vacate a Certificate of Loss of Nationality is not a prescribed “procedure for administrative appeal” for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). The Department's decision in response to such a request is not a prescribed “procedure for administrative appeal” for purposes of § 358 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501). The issuance of a Certificate of Loss of Nationality by the Department is a “final administrative determination” and “final administrative denial” for purposes of §§ 358 and 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1501 and 1503), respectively.\n\n[73 FR 41258, July 18, 2008]",

Minors under 16 years of age applying for a passport must appear in person, unless the personal appearance of the minor is specifically excused by a senior passport authorizing officer, pursuant to guidance issued by the Department. In cases where personal appearance is excused, the person(s) executing the passport application on behalf of the minor shall appear in person and verify the application by oath or affirmation before a person authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths or affirmations, unless these requirements are also excused by a senior passport authorizing officer pursuant to guidance issued by the Department.\n\n(2) Execution of passport application by both parents or by each legal guardian. Except as specifically provided in this section, both parents or each of the minor's legal guardians, if any, whether applying for a passport for the first time or for a renewal, must execute the application on behalf of a minor under age 16 and provide documentary evidence of parentage or legal guardianship showing the minor's name, date and place of birth, and the names of the parent or parents or legal guardian.\n\n(3) Execution of passport application by one parent or legal guardian. A passport application may be executed on behalf of a minor under age 16 by only one parent or legal guardian if such person provides:\n\n(i) A written statement or affidavit from the non-applying parent or legal guardian, if applicable, consenting to the issuance of the passport, and signed before a notary public or, when authorized by the Department, a passport specialist at a public passport agency/center counter operated by the Department of State.\n\n(ii) Documentary evidence that such person is the sole parent or has sole custody of the minor. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) A birth certificate providing the minor's name, date and place of birth and the name of only the applying parent;\n\n(B) A copy of the death certificate for the non-applying parent or legal guardian;\n\n(C) An adoption decree showing the name of only the applying parent;\n\n(D) An order of a court of competent jurisdiction granting sole legal custody to the applying parent or legal guardian containing no travel restrictions inconsistent with issuance of the passport; or, specifically authorizing the applying parent or legal guardian to obtain a passport for the minor, regardless of custodial arrangements; or specifically authorizing the travel of the minor with the applying parent or legal guardian;\n\n(E) An order of a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the parental rights of the non-applying parent or declaring the non-applying parent or legal guardian to be incompetent; and\n\n(F) An order of a court of competent jurisdiction providing for joint legal custody or requiring the permission of both parents or the court for important decisions will be interpreted as requiring the permission of both parents or the court, as appropriate. Notwithstanding the existence of any such court order, a passport may be issued when compelling humanitarian or emergency reasons relating to the welfare of the minor exist.\n\n(4) Execution of passport application by a person acting in loco parentis. (i) A person may apply in loco parentis on behalf of a minor under age 16 by submitting a written statement or affidavit from all parents or each legal guardian, if any, specifically authorizing the application, and signed before a notary public or, when authorized by the Department, a passport specialist at a public passport agency/center counter operated by the Department of State.\n\n(ii) If only one parent or legal guardian provides the written statement or affidavit, the applicant must provide documentary evidence that an application may be made by one parent or legal guardian, consistent with this regulation.\n\n(5) Exigent or special family circumstances. A passport may be issued when only one parent, legal guardian or person acting in loco parentis executes the application, in cases of exigent or special family circumstances.\n\n(i) “Exigent circumstances” are defined as time-sensitive circumstances in which the inability of the minor to obtain a passport would jeopardize the health and safety or welfare of the minor or would result in the minor being separated from the rest of his or her traveling party. “Time sensitive” generally means that there is not enough time before the minor's emergency travel to obtain either the required consent of both parents/legal guardians or documentation reflecting a sole parent's/legal guardian's custody rights.\n\n(ii) “Special family circumstances” are defined as circumstances in which the minor's family situation makes it exceptionally difficult for one or both of the parents to execute the passport application; and/or compelling humanitarian circumstances where the minor's lack of a passport would jeopardize the health, safety, or welfare of the minor; or, pursuant to guidance issued by the Department, circumstances in which return of a minor to the jurisdiction of his or her home state or habitual residence is necessary to permit a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate or enforce a custody determination. A passport issued due to such special family circumstances may be limited for direct return to the United States in accordance with § 51.60(e).\n\n(iii) A parent, legal guardian, or person acting in loco parentis who is applying for a passport for a minor under age 16 under this paragraph must submit a written statement with the application describing the exigent or special family circumstances he or she believes should be taken into consideration in applying an exception.\n\n(iv) Determinations under § 51.28(a)(5) must be made by a senior passport authorizing officer pursuant to guidance issued by the Department.\n\n(6) Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit any Department official adjudicating a passport application filed on behalf of a minor from requiring an applicant to submit other documentary evidence deemed necessary to establish the applying adult's entitlement to obtain a passport on behalf of a minor under the age of 16 in accordance with the provisions of this regulation.\n\n(b) Minors 16 years of age and above. (1) A minor 16 years of age and above applying for a passport must appear in person and may execute the application for a passport on his or her own behalf unless the personal appearance of the minor is specifically excused by a senior passport authorizing officer pursuant to guidance issued by the Department, or unless, in the judgment of the person before whom the application is executed, it is not advisable for the minor to execute his or her own application. In such case, it must be executed by a parent or legal guardian of the minor, or by a person in loco parentis, unless the personal appearance of the parent, legal guardian or person in loco parentis is excused by the senior passport authorizing officer pursuant to guidance issued by the Department.\n\n(2) The passport authorizing officer may at any time require a minor 16 years of age and above to submit the notarized consent of a parent, a legal guardian, or a person in loco parentis to the issuance of the passport.\n\n(c) Rules applicable to all minors—(1) Objections. At any time prior to the issuance of a passport to a minor, the application may be disapproved and a passport may be denied upon receipt of a written objection from a parent or legal guardian of the minor, or from another party claiming authority to object, so long as the objecting party provides sufficient documentation of his or her custodial rights or other authority to object.\n\n(2) An order from a court of competent jurisdiction providing for joint legal custody or requiring the permission of both parents or the court for important decisions will be interpreted as requiring the permission of both parents or the court as appropriate.\n\n(3) The Department will consider a court of competent jurisdiction to be a U.S. state or federal court or a foreign court located in the minor's home state or place of habitual residence.\n\n(4) The Department may require that conflicts regarding custody orders, whether domestic or foreign, be settled by the appropriate court before a passport may be issued.\n\n(5) Access by parents and legal guardians to passport records for minors. Either parent or any legal guardian of a minor may upon written request obtain information regarding the application for and issuance of a passport to a minor, unless the requesting parent's parental rights have been terminated by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, a copy of which has been provided to the Department. The Department may deny such information to a parent or legal guardian if it determines that the minor objects to disclosure and the minor is 16 years of age or older or if the Department determines that the minor is of sufficient age and maturity to invoke his or her own privacy rights.\n\n[72 FR 64931, Nov. 19, 2007, as amended at 88 FR 41025, June 23, 2023; 89 FR 60568, July 26, 2024]",

Exchange visitors enter the United States on a J visa. The regulations set forth in this subpart are applicable to all sponsors.\n\n(c) The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State may, in his or her sole discretion and to the extent consistent with the authorities described in paragraph (a) of this section and other applicable law, waive or modify any provision of this part with respect to programs that are established pursuant to memoranda of understanding, letters of intent or similar arrangements between the United States and foreign governments. When establishing such a program, the Department will publish a notice in the Federal Register describing the program and any resulting modifications to or waivers of provisions of this part. If such an arrangement will not result in a waiver of or other modification to the provisions of this part, then the Department need not publish a notice.\n\n[79 FR 60307, Oct. 6, 2014]",

This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from “Initial” to “No Show.”\n\n(3) End of an exchange visitor's program. Sponsors must report in SEVIS any withdrawal from or early completion of an exchange visitor's program that occurs prior to the “Program End Date” listed in SEVIS on the exchange visitor's Form DS-2019. Sponsors must not alter the “Program End Date” field, but should enter the date of program completion in the “Effective Date of Completion” field. This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from “Active” to “Inactive.” Such notification in SEVIS ends a sponsor's programmatic obligations to the exchange visitor and/or his or her accompanying spouse and dependents.\n\n(4) Accompanying spouse and dependent records. Sponsors must report in SEVIS if accompanying spouses and/or dependents depart from the United States prior to the exchange visitors' departure dates.\n\n(5) Termination of an exchange visitor's program. Sponsors must promptly report in SEVIS the involuntary termination of an exchange visitor's program. Sponsors must not alter the “Program End Date” field, but should enter the date of program termination in the “Effective Date of Termination” field. This will change the status of the SEVIS record from “Active” to “Terminated”. Such notification in SEVIS ends a sponsor's programmatic obligation to the exchange visitor and his or her accompanying spouse and dependents, if any, and prevents the sponsor from thereafter extending the exchange visitor's duration of participation, transferring the exchange visitor to another program, or changing the exchange visitor's category. Sponsors must not terminate the program of an exchange visitor who voluntarily ends his or her program.\n\n(b) Change of circumstance of an exchange visitor. Sponsors must promptly notify the Department of State via SEVIS of any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) Change in the actual and current U.S. address. Sponsors must ensure that the actual and current U.S. addresses of an exchange visitor are reported in SEVIS:\n\n(i) Sponsors must report the U.S. mailing address (i.e., provide a P.O. Box number) in SEVIS in those limited cases where mail cannot be delivered to the exchange visitor's actual and current U.S. address (e.g., the exchange visitor resides in a campus setting); and\n\n(ii) If a U.S. mailing address is reported to SEVIS, sponsors must also maintain records in SEVIS of actual and current U.S. addresses (e.g., dormitory, building and room number) for such exchange visitors.\n\n(2) Change in site of activity. Sponsors must report in SEVIS any change to an exchange visitor's site of activity by entering the new site within ten business days of notification of such a change where sponsor rules or regulations permit such a change. Sponsors must promptly enter any change in the site of activity in those instances where the sponsor is responsible for the placement. Sponsors must identify the “primary” site of activity of an exchange visitor if multiple sites of activity are reported in SEVIS.\n\n(c) Change in sponsor's circumstance. Sponsors must report within ten business days in SEVIS or directly to the Department of State, if appropriate, any material changes to their exchange visitor program as follows:\n\n(1) Change of business and/or mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, or email address;\n\n(2) Change in the composition of the sponsor organization that affects its status as a United States Person as defined in § 62.2, which includes a new Employment Identification Number (EIN);\n\n(3) Change of Responsible Officer or Alternate Responsible Officer;\n\n(4) Major change of ownership or control of the sponsor's organization as defined in § 62.60(e);\n\n(5) Change of the sponsor's principal place of business to a location outside the United States;\n\n(6) Change in financial circumstances that may render the sponsor unable to comply with its obligations as set forth in § 62.9(e);\n\n(7) Loss of licensure or accreditation;\n\n(8) Loss or theft of Forms DS-2019, in which case a sponsor must notify the Department of State promptly by telephone or email of the SEVIS identification numbers of such Forms DS-2019 that have been lost or stolen;\n\n(9) A decision by the sponsor to voluntarily cancel (withdraw) its exchange visitor program designation; or\n\n(10) Any other material facts or events that may have an impact on the sponsor's ability to properly administer or conduct its exchange visitor program.\n\n(d) Serious problem or controversy. Sponsors must inform the Department of State on or before the next business day by telephone (confirmed promptly in writing by facsimile or email) of any investigations of an exchange visitor's site of activity or serious problem or controversy that could be expected to bring the Department of State, the Exchange Visitor Program, or the sponsor's exchange visitor program into notoriety or disrepute, including any potential litigation related to a sponsor's exchange visitor program, in which the sponsor or an exchange visitor may be a named party.\n\n[79 FR 60307, Oct. 6, 2014]",

In addition, sponsors must require that accompanying spouses and dependents of exchange visitors have insurance for sickness and accidents. Sponsors must inform all exchange visitors that they, and any accompanying spouse and dependent(s), also may be subject to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n(b) The period of required coverage is the actual duration of the exchange visitor's participation in the sponsor's exchange visitor program as recorded in SEVIS in the “Program Begin Date,” and as applicable, the “Program End Date,” “Effective Program End Date,” or “Effective Date of Termination” fields. Sponsors are not authorized to charge fees to their sponsored exchange visitors for the provision of insurance coverage beyond any demonstrable and justifiable staff time. Sponsors are not required to, but may, offer supplemental “entry to exit” coverage (i.e., coverage from the time the exchange visitor departs his or her home country until he or she returns). If the sponsor provides health insurance, or arranges for health insurance to be offered the exchange visitor, via payroll deduction at the host organization, the exchange visitor must voluntarily authorize this action in writing and also be given the opportunity to make other arrangements to obtain insurance. These authorizations must be kept on file by the sponsor. Minimum coverage must provide:\n\n(1) Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness;\n\n(2) Repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000;\n\n(3) Expenses associated with the medical evacuation of exchange visitors to his or her home country in the amount of $50,000; and\n\n(4) Deductibles not to exceed $500 per accident or illness.\n\n(c) Insurance policies secured to fulfill the requirements of this section:\n\n(1) May require a waiting period for pre-existing conditions that is reasonable as determined by current industry standards;\n\n(2) May include provisions for co-insurance under the terms of which the exchange visitor may be required to pay up to 25% of the covered benefits per accident or illness; and\n\n(3) Must not unreasonably exclude coverage for perils inherent to the activities of the exchange program in which the exchange visitor participates.\n\n(d) Any policy, plan, or contract secured to fill the above requirements must, at a minimum, be:\n\n(1) Underwritten by an insurance corporation having an A.M. Best rating of “A−” or above; a McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor's Claims-paying Ability rating of “A−” or above; a Weiss Research, Inc. rating of “B + ” or above; a Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of “A−” or above; a Moody's Investor Services rating of “A3” or above; or such other rating as the Department of State may from time to time specify; or\n\n(2) Backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the exchange visitor's home country; or\n\n(3) Part of a health benefits program offered on a group basis to employees or enrolled students by a designated sponsor; or\n\n(4) Offered through or underwritten by a federally qualified Health Maintenance Organization or eligible Competitive Medical Plan as determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n(e) Federal, state or local government agencies; state colleges and universities; and public community colleges may, if permitted by law, self-insure any or all of the above-required insurance coverage.\n\n(f) At the request of a non-governmental sponsor of an exchange visitor program, and upon a showing that such sponsor has funds readily available and under its control sufficient to meet the requirements of this section, the Department of State may permit the sponsor to self-insure or to accept full financial responsibility for such requirements.\n\n(g) The Department of State may, in its sole discretion, condition its approval of self-insurance or the acceptance of full financial responsibility by the non-governmental sponsor by requiring such sponsor to secure a payment bond in favor of the Department of State guaranteeing the sponsor's obligations hereunder.\n\n(h) Accompanying spouses and dependents are required to be covered by insurance in the amounts set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Sponsors must inform exchange visitors of this requirement, in writing, in advance of the exchange visitor's arrival in the United States.\n\n(i) Exchange visitors who willfully fail to maintain the insurance coverage set forth above while a participant in an exchange visitor program or who make material misrepresentations to the sponsor concerning such coverage will be deemed to be in violation of these regulations and will be subject to termination as an exchange visitor.\n\n(j) Sponsors must terminate an exchange visitor's participation in their program if the sponsor determines that the exchange visitor or any accompanying spouse or dependent willfully fails to remain in compliance with this section.\n\n[79 FR 60307, Oct. 6, 2014]",

          "content": "§ 62.20   Professors and research scholars.\n(a) Introduction. These regulations govern Exchange Visitor Program participants in the categories of professor and research scholar, except:\n\n(1) Alien physicians in graduate medical education or training, who are governed by regulations set forth at § 62.27; and\n\n(2) Short-term scholars, who are governed by regulations set forth at § 62.21.\n\n(b) Purpose. The purpose of the Exchange Visitor Program, in part, is to foster the exchange of ideas between Americans and foreign nationals and to stimulate international collaborative teaching, lecturing and research efforts. The exchange of professors and research scholars promotes the exchange of ideas, research, mutual enrichment, and linkages between research and educational institutions in the United States and foreign countries. It does so by providing foreign professors and research scholars the opportunity to engage in research, teaching and lecturing with their American colleagues, to participate actively in cross-cultural activities with Americans, and ultimately to share with their countrymen their experiences and increased knowledge of the United States and their substantive fields.\n\n(c) Designation. The Department of State may, in its sole discretion, designate bona fide exchange visitor programs, which offer foreign nationals the opportunity to engage in research, teaching, lecturing, observing, or consulting at research institutions, corporate research facilities, museums, libraries, post-secondary accredited educational institutions, or similar types of institutions in the United States.\n\n(d) Visitor eligibility. An individual may be selected for participation in the Exchange Visitor Program as a professor or research scholar subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) The participant must not be a candidate for a tenure track position;\n\n(2) The participant has not been physically present in the United States as a nonimmigrant pursuant to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J) for all or part of the twelve-month period immediately proceeding the date of program commencement set forth on his or her Form DS-2019, unless:\n\n(i) The participant is transferring to the sponsor's program pursuant to provisions set forth in § 62.42;\n\n(ii) The participant's presence in the United States was of less than six months duration; or\n\n(iii) The participant's presence in the United States was pursuant to a short-term scholar exchange activity as authorized by § 62.21; and\n\n(3) The participant is not subject to the prohibition against repeat participation set forth at § 62.20(i)(2).\n\n(e) Issuance of Form DS-2019. The Form DS-2019 must be issued only after the professor or research scholar has been accepted by the institution where he or she will participate in an exchange visitor program.\n\n(f) Location of the exchange. Professors or research scholars must conduct their exchange activity at the site(s) of activity identified in SEVIS, which may be either the location of the exchange visitor program sponsor or the site of a third party facilitating the exchange with permission of the Responsible Officer. An exchange visitor may also engage in activities at other locations if such activities constitute occasional lectures or consultations permitted by paragraph (g) of this section. All such sites of activity must be entered into SEVIS while the exchange visitor's SEVIS record is in Initial or Active status.\n\n(g) Occasional lectures or consultations. Professors and research scholars may participate in occasional lectures and short-term consultations, if authorized to do so by his or her sponsor. Such lectures and consultations must be incidental to the exchange visitor's primary program activities. If wages or other remuneration are received by the exchange visitor for such activities, the exchange visitor must act as an independent contractor, as such term is defined in 8 CFR 274a.1(j), and the following criteria and procedures must be satisfied:\n\n(1) Criteria. The occasional lectures or short-term consultations must:\n\n(i) Be directly related to the objectives of the exchange visitor's program;\n\n(ii) Be incidental to the exchange visitor's primary program activities;\n\n(iii) Not delay the completion date of the exchange visitor's program; and\n\n(iv) Be documented in SEVIS.\n\n(2) Procedures. (i) To obtain authorization to engage in occasional lectures or short-term consultations involving wages or other remuneration, the exchange visitor must present to the responsible officer:\n\n(A) A letter from the offeror setting forth the terms and conditions of the offer to lecture or consult, including the duration, number of hours, field or subject, amount of compensation, and description of such activity; and\n\n(B) A letter from the exchange visitor's department head or supervisor recommending such activity and explaining how the activity would enhance the exchange visitor's program.\n\n(ii) The responsible officer must review the letters required in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and make a written determination whether such activity is warranted, will not interrupt the exchange visitor's original objective, and satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.\n\n(h) Change of activity. At the discretion and approval of the responsible officer, professors may freely engage in research and research scholars may freely engage in teaching and lecturing. Because these activities are intertwined, such a change of activity is not considered a change of category necessitating formal approval by the Department of State and does not require the issuance of a new Form DS-2019 to reflect a change in category. Such change in activity does not extend the exchange visitor's maximum duration of program participation.\n\n(i) Duration of participation. The permitted duration of program participation for a professor or research scholar is as follows:\n\n(1) General limitation. A professor or research scholar may be authorized to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program for the length of time necessary to complete his or her program, provided such time does not exceed five years. The five-year period of permitted program participation is continuous and begins with the initial program begin date documented in SEVIS or the date such status was acquired via a petition submitted and approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as documented in SEVIS and ends five years from such date.\n\n(2) Repeat participation. Exchange participants who have entered the United States under the Exchange Visitor Program as a professor or research scholar, or who have acquired such status while in the United States, and who have completed his or her program are not eligible for participation as a professor or research scholar for a period of two years following the end date of such program participation as identified in SEVIS.\n\n(3) Extensions. A responsible officer may not extend the period of program duration beyond the five-year period of maximum program duration authorized for professor and research scholar participants. The Department may, in its sole discretion, authorize an extension beyond the permitted five-year period, as submitted by a “G-7” program sponsor, upon successful demonstration of the following:\n\n(i) The participant for whom an extension is requested is engaged in a research project under the direct sponsorship of a Federally Funded National Research and Development Center (“FFNRDC”) or a U.S. Federal Laboratory;\n\n(ii) The FFNRDC or U.S. Federal Laboratory requesting the extension on behalf of the participant has determined, through peer review, that the participant's continued involvement in the project is beneficial to its successful conclusion; and\n\n(iii) The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has determined in his/her discretion that the extension may be approved;\n\n(iv) The extension request is for not more than five years.\n\n[70 FR 28817, May 19, 2005; 70 FR 36344, June 23, 2005]",

It does so by providing foreign scholars the opportunity to exchange ideas with their American colleagues, participate in educational and professional programs, confer on common problems and projects, and promote professional relationships and communications.\n\n(c) Designation. The Department of State may, in its sole discretion, designate bona fide programs which offer foreign nationals the opportunity to engage in short-term visits for the purpose of lecturing, observing, consulting, training, or demonstrating special skills at research institutions, museums, libraries, post-secondary accredited educational institutions, or similar types of institutions.\n\n(d) Visitor eligibility.

          "content": "§ 62.22   Trainees and interns.\n(a) Introduction. These regulations govern Exchange Visitor Programs under which foreign nationals with significant experience in their occupational field have the opportunity to receive training in the United States in such field. These regulations also establish a new internship program under which foreign national students and recent graduates of foreign post-secondary academic institutions have the opportunity to receive training in the United States in their field of academic study. These regulations include specific requirements to ensure that both trainees and interns receive hands-on experience in their specific fields of study/expertise and that they do not merely participate in work programs. Regulations dealing with training opportunities for certain foreign students who are studying at post-secondary accredited educational institutions in the United States are located at § 62.23 (“College and University Students”). Regulations governing alien physicians in graduate medical education or training are located at § 62.27 (“Alien Physicians”).\n\n(b) Purpose. (1)(i) The primary objectives of the programs offered under these regulations are to enhance the skills and expertise of exchange visitors in their academic or occupational fields through participation in structured and guided work-based training and internship programs and to improve participants' knowledge of American techniques, methodologies, and technology. Such training and internship programs are also intended to increase participants' understanding of American culture and society and to enhance Americans' knowledge of foreign cultures and skills through an open interchange of ideas between participants and their American associates. A key goal of the Fulbright-Hays Act, which authorizes these programs, is that participants will return to their home countries and share their experiences with their countrymen.\n\n(ii) Exchange Visitor Program training and internship programs must not be used as substitutes for ordinary employment or work purposes; nor may they be used under any circumstances to displace American workers. The requirements in these regulations for trainees are designed to distinguish between bona fide training, which is permitted, and merely gaining additional work experience, which is not permitted. The requirements in these regulations for interns are designed to distinguish between a period of work-based learning in the intern's academic field, which is permitted (and which requires a substantial academic framework in the participant's field), and unskilled labor, which is not.\n\n(2) In addition, a specific objective of the new internship program is to provide foreign nationals who are currently enrolled full-time and pursuing studies at a degree- or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institution or graduated from such an institution no more than 12 months prior to their exchange visitor program begin date a period of work-based learning to allow them to develop practical skills that will enhance their future careers. Bridging the gap between formal education and practical work experience and gaining substantive cross-cultural experience are major goals in educational institutions around the world. By providing training opportunities for current foreign students and recent foreign graduates at formative stages of their development, the U.S. Government will build partnerships, promote mutual understanding, and develop networks for relationships that will last through generations as these foreign nationals move into leadership roles in a broad range of occupational fields in their own societies. These results are closely tied to the goals, themes, and spirit of the Fulbright-Hays Act.\n\n(c) Designation. (1) The Department may, in its sole discretion, designate as sponsors those entities it deems to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Subpart A of 22 CFR part 62 and to have the organizational capacity successfully to administer and facilitate training and internship programs.\n\n(2) Sponsors must provide training and internship programs only in the occupational category or categories for which the Department has designated them as sponsors. The Department may designate training and internship programs in any of the following occupational categories:\n\n(i) Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing;\n\n(ii) Arts and Culture;\n\n(iii) Construction and Building Trades;\n\n(iv) Education, Social Sciences, Library Science, Counseling and Social Services;\n\n(v) Health Related Occupations;\n\n(vi) Hospitality and Tourism;\n\n(vii) Information Media and Communications;\n\n(viii) Management, Business, Commerce and Finance;\n\n(ix) Public Administration and Law; and\n\n(x) The Sciences, Engineering, Architecture, Mathematics, and Industrial Occupations.\n\n(d) Selection criteria. (1) In addition to satisfying the general requirements set forth in § 62.10(a), sponsors must ensure that trainees and interns have verifiable English language skills sufficient to function on a day-to-day basis in their training environment. Sponsors must verify an applicant's English language proficiency through a recognized English language test, by signed documentation from an academic institution or English language school, or through a documented interview conducted by the sponsor either in-person or by videoconferencing, or by telephone if videoconferencing is not a viable option.\n\n(2) Sponsors of training programs must verify that all potential trainees are foreign nationals who have either a degree or professional certificate from a foreign post-secondary academic institution and at least one year of prior related work experience in their occupational field acquired outside the United States or five years of work experience in their occupational field acquired outside the United States.\n\n(3) Sponsors of internship programs must verify that all potential interns are foreign nationals who are currently enrolled full-time and pursuing studies in their advanced chosen career field at a degree- or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institution outside the United States or graduated from such an institution no more than 12 months prior to their exchange visitor program begin date.\n\n(e) Issuance of Forms DS-2019.

For training programs in the field of agriculture and in the occupational category of Hospitality and Tourism, the maximum duration of program participation is 12 months. If an original T/IPP specifies that at least six months of a program includes related classroom participation and studies, training programs in the field of agriculture may be designated for a total duration of 18 months. Program extensions are permitted within the maximum duration as set forth in the letter of designation/redesignation provided that the need for an extended training or internship program is documented by the full completion and execution of a new Form DS-7002. 12-month training programs in the field of agriculture may not be extended to 18 months by adding six months of classroom participation and studies at the end of the original 12-month program duration. Per above, the six months of related classroom participation and studies must have been part of the trainee's original T/IPP.\n\n(l) Evaluations. In order to ensure the quality of training and internship programs, sponsors must develop procedures for evaluating all trainees and interns. All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a training and internship program, and both the trainees and interns and their immediate supervisors must sign the evaluation forms.

Foreign nationals who enter the United States under the Exchange Visitor Program to participate in training and internship programs are eligible to participate in additional training and internship programs under certain conditions. For both trainees and interns, additional training and internship programs must address the development of more advanced skills or a different field of expertise. Interns may apply for additional internship programs if they:\n\n(1) Are currently enrolled full-time and pursuing studies at degree- or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institutions outside the United States; or,\n\n(2) Have graduated from such institutions no more than 12 months prior to the start of their proposed exchange visitor program. A new internship is also permissible when a student has successfully completed a recognized course of study (i.e., associate, bachelors, masters, Ph.D., or their recognized equivalents) and has enrolled and is pursuing studies at the next higher level of academic study. Trainees are eligible for additional training programs after a period of at least two years residency outside the United States following completion of their training program. Participants who have successfully completed internship programs and no longer meet the selection criteria for an internship program may participate in a training program if they have resided outside the United States or its territories for at least two years. If participants meet these selection criteria and fulfill these conditions, there will be no limit to the number of times they may participate in a training and internship program.\n\n[75 FR 48559, Aug. 11, 2010]",

Exchange teachers sharpen their professional skills and participate in cross-cultural activities in schools and communities, and they return home after the exchange to share their experiences and increased knowledge of the United States and the U.S. educational system. Such exchanges enable foreign teachers to understand better U.S. culture, society and teaching practices at the primary and secondary levels, and enhance U.S. students' knowledge of foreign cultures, customs and teaching approaches.\n\n(b) Designation. The Department may, in its discretion, designate bona fide programs satisfying the objectives in paragraph (a) of this section as exchange visitor programs in the Teacher category.\n\n(c) Definitions. In addition to those definitions set forth in § 62.2, the following definitions apply to the Teacher category of the Exchange Visitor Program:\n\n(1) Accredited primary or accredited secondary school: Any publicly or privately operated primary or secondary institution for educating children in the United States that offers mainly academic programs and is duly accredited by the appropriate academic accrediting authority of the jurisdiction in which such institution is located.\n\n(2) Full-time teaching: A minimum of 32 hours per week of teaching or teaching-related administrative activities.\n\n(3) Home country school: An exchange teacher's school in his or her country of nationality or last legal country of residence.\n\n(4) Host school: The U.S.-accredited primary or secondary school in which a sponsor places an exchange teacher pursuant to the exchange teacher's written acceptance of the placement.\n\n(5) International school: A school that is so designated by its school district, state, or other applicable governing authority, or one whose curriculum focuses predominantly on international aspects of the subject matter taught and/or language immersion, or one that predominantly follows a national curriculum of a foreign country.\n\n(6) Language immersion program: A program that is a regular course of study offered by an accredited school having sustained and enriched instruction, in a language not native to the majority of the student population, that occurs for at least fifty percent of the school day.\n\n(7) Virtual exchange: A technology-enabled, sustained, people-to-people cross-cultural educational program that may supplement the goals of an in-person exchange and integrates global knowledge, cultural awareness, and/or foreign language into the classroom or other setting.\n\n(d) Teacher eligibility.

Exchange teachers may teach a variety of subjects and levels at their host school or schools, if qualified, but at the pre-kindergarten level, may teach only in language immersion programs.\n\n(e) Teacher selection. Sponsors must screen foreign teachers carefully before accepting them for the program. In addition to the requirements set forth in § 62.10 and all security checks required by U.S. state departments of education and host schools, sponsors also must:\n\n(1) Verify the qualifications of each foreign teacher to determine whether he or she satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this section;\n\n(2) Secure references from one colleague and one current or former supervisor of each foreign teacher, attesting to that teacher's good reputation, character and teaching skills;\n\n(3) Verify that each selected foreign teacher applicant possesses sufficient proficiency in the English language to function in U.S. classrooms and to function on a day-to-day basis, in accordance with the provision for selection of exchange visitors set forth at § 62.10(a)(2); and\n\n(4) Verify that each foreign teacher who is eligible for the program under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section has a letter from the head of a school in another country, preferably that teacher's home country, which states that school's willingness to work with the exchange teacher on the cross-cultural activity component set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii).

Exchange teachers may be authorized to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program for the length of time necessary to complete the program, which may not exceed three years unless a specific extension of one or two years is authorized by the Department as set forth in paragraph (k) of this section.\n\n(k) Program extensions. (1) Sponsors may request from the Department an extension of an exchange teacher's exchange by either one or two years, but not by a semester or by other fractions of academic years.\n\n(2) The sponsor's request for extension must include:\n\n(i) A letter of reference on official letterhead written by the host school or host school district administrator responsible for overseeing the exchange teacher that describes the exchange teacher's performance during the previous three years of the exchange and how the host school has benefited from the exchange teacher's presence; and\n\n(ii) a document describing how the exchange teacher over the previous three years has engaged his or her classroom, the wider host school or host school district, or community through the cross-cultural activity component, if these activities are not already detailed in the exchange teacher's annual reports.\n\n(3) Sponsors must submit their extension request and supporting documentation for the extension to the Department no later than three months prior to the beginning of the desired extension period for the exchange teacher.\n\n(4) Sponsor requests for extension must include proof of payment of the required non-refundable extension fee as set forth in § 62.17.\n\n(5) The Department, at its discretion, may authorize a sponsor to extend an exchange teacher's participation for either one or two additional years beyond the initial three-year exchange period. Sponsors must comply with all Department guidance on creating an extension record for the teacher within SEVIS.\n\n(6) Sponsors that applied for a two-year extension on behalf of a host school and its exchange teacher and received permission from the Department only for a one-year extension may apply again to extend the program of that host school's exchange teacher for one additional year by following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (k)(2)-(4) of this section. The sponsor should include with such additional extension request a copy of the prior extension request submitted to enable the initial one-year extension.\n\n(l) Repeat participation. Foreign nationals who have successfully completed teacher exchange programs are eligible to participate in additional teacher exchange programs, provided that they have resided outside the United States for at least two years following the successful completion of their most recent teacher exchange program and continue to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n[81 FR 4955, Jan. 29, 2016]",

The Exchange Visitor Program promotes the interchange of knowledge and skills among foreign and American specialists, who are defined as experts in a field of specialized knowledge or skills, and who visit the United States for the purpose of observing, consulting, or demonstrating their special skills. It does so by providing foreign specialists the opportunity to observe American institutions and methods of practice in their professional fields, and to share their specialized knowledge with their American colleagues. The exchange of specialists promotes mutual enrichment, and furthers linkages among scientific institutions, government agencies, museums, corporations, libraries, and similar types of institutions. Such exchanges also enable visitors to better understand American culture and society and enhance American knowledge of foreign cultures and skills. This category is intended for exchanges with experts in such areas, for example, as mass media communication, environmental science, youth leadership, international educational exchange, museum exhibitions, labor law, public administration, and library science. This category is not intended for experts covered by the exchange visitor categories listed in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section.\n\n(c) Designation. The Department of State may, in its discretion, designate bona fide programs satisfying the objectives in section (b) above as an exchange visitor program in the specialist category.\n\n(d) Visitor eligibility.

Sponsors shall adequately screen and select specialists prior to accepting them for the program, providing a formal selection process, including at a minimum:\n\n(1) Evaluation of the qualifications of foreign nationals to determine whether they meet the definition of specialist as set forth in § 62.4(g); and\n\n(2) Screening foreign nationals to ensure that the requirements of § 62.10(a) are satisfied.\n\n(f) Program disclosure. Before the program begins, the sponsor shall provide the specialist, in addition to what is required in § 62.10(b), with:\n\n(1) Information on the length and location(s) of his or her exchange visitor program;\n\n(2) A summary of the significant components of the program; and\n\n(3) A written statement which clearly states the stipend, if any, to be paid to the specialist.\n\n(g) Issuance of Form IAP-66. The Form DS-2019 shall be issued only after the specialist has been accepted by the organization(s) with which he or she will participate in an exchange visitor program.\n\n(h) Location of the exchange. The specialist shall participate in an exchange visitor program at the location(s) listed on his or her Form DS-2019.\n\n(i) Duration of participation.

          "content": "§ 62.30   Camp counselors.\n(a) Introduction. In order to promote diverse opportunities for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs, the Department of State designates exchange sponsors to facilitate the entry of foreign nationals to serve as counselors in U.S. summer camps. These programs promote international understanding by improving American knowledge of foreign cultures while enabling foreign participants to increase their knowledge of American culture. The foreign participants are best able to carry out this objective by serving as counselors per se, that is, having direct responsibility for supervision of groups of American youth and of activities that bring them into interaction with their charges. While it is recognized that some non-counseling chores are an essential part of camp life for all counselors, this program is not intended to assist American camps in bringing in foreign nationals to serve as administrative personnel, cooks, or menial laborers, such as dishwashers or janitors.\n\n(b) Participant eligibility. Participation in camp counselor exchange programs is limited to foreign nationals who:\n\n(1) Are at least 18 years of age;\n\n(2) Are bona fide youth workers, students, teachers, or individuals with specialized skills; and\n\n(c) Participant selection. In addition to satisfying the requirements in § 62.10(a), sponsors shall adequately screen all international candidates for camp counselor programs and at a minimum:\n\n(1) Conduct an in-person interview; and\n\n(2) Secure references from a participant's employer or teacher regarding his or her suitability for participation in a camp counselor exchange.\n\n(d) Participant orientation. Sponsors shall provide participants, prior to their departure from the home country, detailed information regarding:\n\n(1) Duties and responsibilities relating to their service as a camp counselor;\n\n(2) Contractual obligations relating to their acceptance of a camp counselor position; and\n\n(3) Financial compensation for their service as a camp counselor.\n\n(e) Participant placements. Sponsors shall place eligible participants at camping facilities which are:\n\n(1) Accredited;\n\n(2) A member in good standing of the American Camping Association;\n\n(3) Officially affiliated with a nationally recognized non-profit organization; or\n\n(4) Have been inspected, evaluated, and approved by the sponsor.\n\n(f) Participant compensation. Sponsors shall ensure that international participants receive pay and benefits commensurate with those offered to their American counterparts.\n\n(g) Participant supervision. Sponsors shall provide all participants with a phone number which allows 24 hour immediate contact with the sponsor.\n\n(h) Program administration. Sponsors shall:\n\n(1) Comply with all provisions set forth in subpart A of this part;\n\n(2) Not facilitate the entry of any participant for a program of more than four months duration; and\n\n(3) Under no circumstance facilitate the entry into the United States of a participant for whom a camp placement has not been pre-arranged.\n\n(i) Placement report. In lieu of listing the name and address of the camp facility at which the participant is placed on Form DS-2019, sponsors shall submit to the Department of State, no later than July 1st of each year, a report of all participant placements. Such report shall reflect the participant's name, camp placement, and the number of times the participant has previously participated in a camp counselor exchange. \n\n(j) In order to ensure that as many different individuals as possible are recruited for participation in camp counselor programs, sponsors shall limit the number of participants who have previously participated more than once in any camp counselor exchange to not more than ten percent of the total number of participants that the sponsor placed in the immediately preceding year.\n\n[58 FR 15196, Mar. 19, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 16984, Apr. 11, 1994.

An au pair participating in the EduCare program shall not be placed with a family having pre-school children in the home unless alternative full-time arrangements for the supervision of such pre-school children are in place;\n\n(4) Place an au pair with a host family having a special needs child, as so identified by the host family, unless the au pair has specifically identified his or her prior experience, skills, or training in the care of special needs children and the host family has reviewed and acknowledged in writing the au pair's prior experience, skills, or training so identified;\n\n(5) Place an au pair with a host family unless a written agreement between the au pair and the host family detailing the au pair's obligation to provide child care has been signed by both the au pair and the host family prior to the au pair's departure from his or her home country. Such agreement shall clearly state whether the au pair is an EduCare program participant or not. Such agreement shall limit the obligation to provide child care services to not more than 10 hours per day or more than 45 hours per week unless the au pair is an EduCare participant.

          "content": "§ 62.32   Summer work travel.\n(a) Introduction. The regulations in this section (in combination with any other provisions of 22 CFR part 62, as applicable) govern participation in Summer Work Travel programs conducted by Department of State-designated sponsors pursuant to the authority granted the Department of State under Public Law 105-277.\n\n(b) Purpose. The purpose of this program is to provide foreign college and university students with opportunities to interact with U.S. citizens, experience U.S. culture while sharing their own cultures with Americans they meet, travel in the United States, and work in jobs that require minimal training and are seasonal or temporary in order to earn funds to help defray a portion of their expenses. Employment is of a seasonal nature when the required service is tied to a certain time of the year by an event or pattern and requires labor levels above and beyond existing worker levels. Employment is of a temporary nature when an employer's need for the duties to be performed is a one-time occurrence, a peak load need, or an intermittent need. It is the nature of employers' needs, not the nature of the duties that is controlling.\n\n(c) Duration of participation. Summer Work Travel participants are authorized to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program for up to four months during the long break between academic years as determined by the Department of State. Extensions of program participation are not permitted.\n\n(d) Participant screening and selection. In addition to satisfying the requirements set forth at § 62.10(a), sponsors are solely responsible for adequately screening and making the final selection. The screening process requires that sponsors (or vetted foreign entities acting on their behalf) at a minimum must:\n\n(1) Conduct and document interviews with potential participants either in-person or by video-conference;\n\n(2) Verify proficiency in conversational English and reading comprehension through either recognized language tests administered by academic institutions or English language schools or through the required documented interviews;\n\n(3) Select applicants who demonstrate their intention to participate in the cultural aspects of the Summer Work Travel Program.\n\n(4) Confirm that at the time of application, applicants (including final year students) are enrolled full-time and pursuing studies at accredited post-secondary, classroom-based, academic institutions physically located outside of the United States and have successfully completed at least one semester, or equivalent, of post-secondary academic study.\n\n(e) Participant orientation. In addition to satisfying the requirements set forth at § 62.10(b) and (c), sponsors must provide program participants, prior to participants' departures from their home countries, the following information and/or documentation:\n\n(1) A copy of the Department of State's Summer Work Travel Participant Letter;\n\n(2) A copy of the Department of State's Summer Work Travel Program Brochure;\n\n(3) The Department of State's toll-free help line telephone number;\n\n(4) The sponsor's 24/7 immediate contact telephone number;\n\n(5) Information advising participants of their obligations to notify their sponsors within ten days after they arrive in the United States and within ten days after they initially secure or change residences;\n\n(6) Information advising participants that they may not begin working at initial, replacement, or additional jobs until their sponsors have verified the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetted their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section;\n\n(7) For participants with jobs secured prior to departing from selected home countries, documentation explaining the terms and conditions of such jobs and providing information about available housing and transportation to and from work;\n\n(8) Information explaining the cultural component of the Summer Work Travel Program, including guidance on how to best experience U.S. culture and/or descriptions of cultural opportunities arranged by the sponsor; and\n\n(9) Information explaining that sponsors will terminate the programs of participants who fail to comply with enumerated program regulations (i.e., reporting their arrivals, reporting changes of residence, not starting work at unverified jobs, responding to sponsor monthly outreach/monitoring efforts).\n\n(f) Cultural exchange. (1) Sponsors must ensure that all participants have opportunities to work alongside U.S. citizens and interact regularly with U.S. citizens to experience U.S. culture during the workday portion of their Summer Work Travel programs; and\n\n(2) Sponsors must ensure that all participants have opportunities to engage in cultural activities or events outside of work by planning, initializing, and carrying out events or other activities that provide participants' exposure to U.S. culture.\n\n(g) Participant placement. (1) Sponsors and third parties acting on their behalf may not pay or otherwise provide any incentive to employers to accept program participants for job placements with such employers.\n\n(2) Sponsors must confirm initial, replacement, and additional jobs placements of all Summer Work Travel Program participants before participants may start work by verifying, at a minimum, the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetting their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section. Once participants have arrived in the United States and identified initial, replacement, or additional jobs, sponsors must vet such jobs within 72 hours.\n\n(3) Sponsors must not pose obstacles to job changes, but must offer reasonable assistance to participants wishing to change jobs regardless of whether their jobs were secured by the sponsors (direct-placed) or by the participants (self-placed).\n\n(4) Sponsors may place participants only in jobs that:\n\n(i) Are seasonal or temporary as defined in paragraph (b) of this section; and\n\n(ii) Provide opportunities for regular communication and interaction with U.S. citizens and allow participants to experience U.S. culture.\n\n(5) Sponsors may not place participants in jobs:\n\n(i) That require licensing;\n\n(ii) That are on the program exclusion list set forth at paragraph (h) of this section; or\n\n(iii) For which there is another specific J visa category (e.g., Camp Counselor, Trainee, Intern).\n\n(6) Sponsors may not place participants with staffing agencies unless the placements meet the following three criteria:\n\n(i) Participants must be employees of and paid by the staffing agencies;\n\n(ii) Staffing agencies must provide full-time, primary, on-site supervision of the participants;\n\n(iii) Staffing agencies must effectively control the work sites, e.g., have hands-on management responsibility for the participants.\n\n(7) Sponsors may not place participants with employers that fill non-seasonal or non-temporary job openings with exchange visitors with staggered vacation schedules.\n\n(8) Sponsors must use extra caution when placing students in positions at employers in lines of business that are frequently associated with trafficking persons (e.g., modeling agencies, housekeeping, janitorial services).\n\n(9) Sponsors must consider the availability of suitable, affordable housing (e.g., that meets local codes and ordinances) and reliable, affordable, and convenient transportation to and from work when making job placements.\n\n(i) If employers do not provide or arrange housing and/or transportation, or if participants decline employer-provided housing or transportation, sponsors must actively and immediately assist participants with arranging appropriate housing and transportation.\n\n(ii) If employers provide housing and/or transportation to and from work, job offers must include details of all such arrangements, including the cost to participants; whether such arrangements deduct such costs from participants' wages; and the market value of housing and/or transportation in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations set forth at 29 CFR part 531, if they are considered part of the compensation packages.\n\n(10) For participants who are nationals of non-Visa Waiver Program countries and participants who are nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries with job placements screened in advance by the sponsors (direct placement) or jobs found by the participants (self-placement), prior to issuing Form DS-2019, sponsors must vet the potential employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section, confirm the terms and conditions of the job offers, and input complete and correct data into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 62.70(f).\n\n(11) Sponsors of applicants who are nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries and who have not secured jobs prior to departing from their home countries must:\n\n(i) Ensure that such participants receive pre-departure information that explains how to seek employment and secure lodging in the United States, and clearly identifies the criteria for appropriate jobs set forth at paragraph (g) of this section and the categories of employment and positions that are on the program exclusion list set forth at paragraph (h) of this section;\n\n(ii) Ensure that such participants have sufficient financial resources to support themselves during their searches for employment;\n\n(iii) Assist participants who have not found suitable employment within one week of commencing their job searches;\n\n(iv) Instruct participants of their obligation to notify their sponsors when they obtain job offers (and that they cannot start such jobs until the sponsors vet them); and\n\n(v) Promptly (i.e., within 72 hours) confirm the initial jobs of such participants, at a minimum, by verifying the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetting their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section.\n\n(h) Program exclusions. Sponsors must not place participants:\n\n(1) In positions that could bring notoriety or disrepute to the Exchange Visitor Program;\n\n(2) In sales positions that require participants to purchase inventory that they must sell in order to support themselves;\n\n(3) In domestic help positions in private homes (e.g., child care, elder care, gardener, chauffeur);\n\n(4) As pedicab or rolling chair drivers or operators;\n\n(5) As operators or drivers of vehicles or vessels for which drivers' licenses are required regardless of whether they carry passengers or not;\n\n(6) In positions related to clinical care that involves patient contact;\n\n(7) In any position in the adult entertainment industry (including, but not limited to jobs with escort services, adult book/video stores, and strip clubs);\n\n(8) In positions requiring work hours that fall predominantly between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.;\n\n(9) In positions declared hazardous to youth by the Secretary of Labor at Subpart E of 29 CFR part 570;\n\n(10) In positions that require sustained physical contact with other people and/or adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Universal Blood and Body Fluid Precautions guidelines (e.g., body piercing, tattooing, massage, manicure);\n\n(11) In positions that are substantially commission-based and thus do not guarantee that participants will be paid minimum wage in accordance with federal and state standards;\n\n(12) In positions involved in gaming and gambling that include direct participation in wagering and/or betting;\n\n(13) In positions in chemical pest control, warehousing, catalogue/online order distribution centers;\n\n(14) In positions with travelling fairs or itinerant concessionaires;\n\n(15) In positions for which there is another specific J category (e.g., camp counselor, intern, trainee); or\n\n(16) After November 1, 2012, in positions in the North American Industry Classification System's (NAICS) Goods-Producing Industries occupational categories industry sectors 11, 21, 23, 31-33 numbers (set forth at http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag_index_naics.htm).\n\n(i) Participant compensation. (1) Sponsors must inform program participants of Federal, State, and Local Minimum Wage requirements, and ensure that at a minimum, participants are compensated at the higher of:\n\n(i) The applicable Federal, State, or Local Minimum Wage (including overtime); or\n\n(ii) Pay and benefits commensurate with those offered to their similarly situated U.S. counterparts.\n\n(2) Sponsors must demonstrate that participants are also compensated according to the above standards in the following (and similar) situations:\n\n(i) The host employers provide housing and/or transportation as part of participants' compensation, but the compensation package does not explain that the lower hourly wage reflects such benefits; or\n\n(ii) The employers compensate participants on a “piece” basis (e.g., number of rooms cleaned). If at the end of each pay period, the participant's earnings under the piece rate do not equal at least the amount the participant would have earned had the participant been paid the predominant local wage as provided in subparagraph (1), the participant's pay must be supplemented at that time so that the participant's earnings are at least as much as the required local wage as provided in subparagraph (1).\n\n(3) Sponsors must ensure that appropriate assistance is provided to participants on an as-needed basis and that sponsors are available to participants (and host employers) to assist as facilitators, counselors, and information resources.\n\n(j) Monitoring.

Such contact may be in-person, by telephone, or via exchanges of electronic mail (including a response from the participant) and must be properly documented. Sponsors must promptly and appropriately address issues affecting the participants' health, safety, and welfare identified through such contacts; and\n\n(2) Provide appropriate assistance to participants on an as-needed basis and be available to participants (and host employers) to assist as facilitators, counselors, and information resources.\n\n(k) Internal controls. Sponsors must utilize organization-specific standard operating procedures for training and supervising all organization employees. In addition, sponsors must establish internal controls to ensure that employers and/or foreign entities comply with the terms of agreements with such third parties involved in the administration of the sponsors' exchange visitor programs (i.e., affect the core programmatic functions).\n\n(l) Sponsors' use of third parties. (1) If sponsors utilize foreign third party entities to assist in fulfilling the core programmatic functions of screening and orientation that may be conducted outside the United States, they must first obtain written and executed agreements with such third parties. For the purpose of this section, U.S. entities operating outside the United States (or its possessions or territories) are considered foreign entities.

          "content": "§ 62.45   Reinstatement to valid program status.\n(a) Definitions. For purpose of this section—\n\nYou means the Responsible Officer or Alternate Responsible Officer;\n\nExchange visitor means the person who enters the United States on a J visa in order to participate in an exchange program designated by the Secretary of State of the Department of State.\n\nFails or failed maintain valid program status means the status of an exchange visitor who has completed, concluded, ceased, interrupted, graduated from, or otherwise terminated the exchange visitor's participation in the exchange program, or who remains in the United States beyond the end date on the exchange visitor's current Form DS-2019.\n\nUnauthorized employment means any employment not properly authorized by you or by the Attorney General, i.e., the Immigration and Naturalization Service, prior to commencement of employment. Unauthorized employment does not include activities that are normally approvable, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.\n\nWe, our, or us means the office of Exchange Visitor Program Services of the Department of State.\n\n(b) Who is authorized to correct minor or technical infractions of the Exchange Visitor Program regulations? (1) If the exchange visitor committed a technical or minor infraction of the regulations, you are authorized to correct the exchange visitor's records with respect to such technical or minor infractions of the regulations in this part. Your correction of such an infraction(s) returns the exchange visitor to the status quo ante, i.e., it is as if the infraction never occurred.\n\n(2) You may only correct the exchange visitor's record with respect to a technical or minor infraction of the regulations in this part if the exchange visitor is pursuing or intending to pursue the exchange visitor's original program objective.\n\n(3) You may not correct the exchange visitor's records with respect to a technical or minor infraction of the regulations in this part if the exchange visitor has willfully failed to maintain insurance coverage during the period for which the record is being corrected; if the exchange visitor has engaged in unauthorized employment during that period, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, of if the exchange visitor was involuntarily suspended or terminated from his or her program during the period.\n\n(4) If the exchange visitor has failed to maintain valid program status because of a substantive violation of the regulations in this part, you must apply to us for reinstatement.\n\n(c) What violations or infractions of the regulations in this part do we consider to be technical or minor ones, and how do you correct the record? We consider the following to be examples of technical or minor infractions which you are authorized to correct:\n\n(1) Failure to extend the Form DS-2019 in a timely manner (i.e., prior to the end date on the current Form DS-2019) due to inadvertence or neglect on your part or on the part of the exchange visitor.\n\n(2) Failure on the part of the exchange visitor to conclude a transfer of program prior to the end date on the current Form DS-2019 due to administrative delay or oversight, inadvertence or neglect on your part or on the part of the exchange visitor;\n\n(3) Failure to receive your prior approval and/or an amended Form DS-2019 before accepting an honorarium or other type of payment for engaging in a normally approvable and appropriate activity. Example, a lecture, consultation, or other activity appropriate to the category which is provided by a professor, research scholar, short-term scholar or specialist without prior approval or an amended Form DS-2019 issued prior to the occurrence of the activity.\n\n(4) You correct the record status quo ante by issuing a Form DS-2019 or by writing an authorization letter to reflect the continuity in the program or the permission to engage in the activity that a timely issued document would have reflected.\n\n(i) Forms DS-2019 should be:\n\n(A) Issued to show continued authorized stay without interruption;\n\n(B) Marked in the “purpose” box with the appropriate purpose (i.e., extension, transfer, etc.) and with the additional notation of “correct the record” typed in;\n\n(C) Dated as of the date the Form was actually executed; and,\n\n(D) Submitted to the Department of State in the same way as any other notification.\n\n(ii) Letters or other authorization documents should be:\n\n(A) Issued according to the regulations in this part appropriate to the category and the activity;\n\n(B) Marked or annotated to show “correct the record,”\n\n(C) Dated as of the date the letter or document was actually executed; and,\n\n(D) Attached to the exchange visitor's Form DS-2019 and/or retained in the sponsor's file as required by the regulations in this part for that particular type of letter or document.\n\n(d) How do you determine if an infraction, other than those examples listed above is a technical or minor infraction? It is impossible to list every example of a technical or minor infraction. To guide you in making a determination, you are to examine the following criteria:\n\n(1) Regardless of the reason, has the exchange visitor failed to maintain valid program status for more than 120 calendar days after the end date on the current Form DS-2019?\n\n(2) Has the exchange visitor, by his or her actions, failed to maintain, at all relevant times, his or her original program objective?\n\n(3) Has the exchange visitor willfully failed to comply with our insurance coverage requirements (§ 62.14)?\n\n(4) Has the exchange visitor engaged in unauthorized employment, as that term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section?\n\n(5) Has the exchange visitor category been involuntarily suspended or terminated from his or her program?\n\n(6) Has an exchange visitor in the student category failed to maintain a full course of study (as defined in § 62.2) without prior consultation with you and the exchange visitor's academic advisor?\n\n(7) Has the exchange visitor failed to pay the fee mandated by Public Law 104-208 (the “CIPRIS” fee)?\n\n(8) If the answer to any of the above questions is “yes,” then the infraction is not a technical or minor one and you are not authorized to reinstate the exchange visitor to valid program status.\n\n(e) Which violations or infractions do we consider to be substantive ones requiring you to apply to us for reinstatement? The following are substantive violations or infractions of the regulations in this part by the exchange visitor which require you to apply to us for reinstatement to valid program status:\n\n(1) Failure to maintain valid program status for more than 120 days after the end date on the current Form DS-2019;\n\n(2) If a student, failure to maintain a full course of study (as defined in § 62.2) without prior consultation with you and the exchange visitor's academic advisor.\n\n(f) Which, if any, violations of the regulations in this part or other conditions preclude reinstatement and will result in a denial if application is made? We will not consider requests for reinstatement (nor should you) when an exchange visitor has:\n\n(1) Knowingly or willfully failed to obtain or maintain the required health insurance (§ 62.14) at all times while in the United States;\n\n(2) Engaged in unauthorized employment, as that term is defined in paragraph (a) of this section;\n\n(3) Been suspended or terminated from the most recent exchange visitor program;\n\n(4) Failed to maintain valid program status for more than 270 calendar days;\n\n(5) Received a favorable recommendation from the Department of State on an application for waiver of section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(e)]; or,\n\n(6) Failed to pay the fee mandated by Public Law 104-208 (the “CIPRIS” fee.)\n\n(g) What if you cannot determine which category (technical, substantive, or non-reinstatable) the violation or infraction falls within? If you cannot determine which category the violation or condition falls within, then you must, on behalf of the exchange visitor, apply to us for reinstatement.\n\n(h) If you determine that the exchange visitor's violation of the regulations in this part is a substantive one, how do you apply for a reinstatement to valid program status? (1) If you determine that the violation of the regulations in this part is a substantive one, and that the exchange visitor has failed to maintain valid program status for 120 days or less, you must apply to us for reinstatement of the exchange visitor to valid program status. Your application must include:\n\n(i) All copies of the exchange visitor's Forms DS-2019 issued to date;\n\n(ii) A new, completed Form DS-2019, showing in Block 3 the date of the period for which reinstatement is sought, i.e., the new program end date;\n\n(iii) A copy of the receipt showing that the Public Law 104-208 fee has been paid; and,\n\n(iv) A written statement (and documentary information supporting such statement):\n\n(A) Declaring that the exchange visitor is pursuing or was at all times intending to pursue the original exchange visitor program activity for which the exchange visitor was admitted to the United States; and,\n\n(B) Showing that the exchange visitor failed to maintain valid program status due to circumstances beyond the control of the exchange visitor, or from administrative delay or oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect on your part or the exchange visitor's part; or,\n\n(C) Showing that it would be an unusual hardship to the exchange visitor if we do not grant the reinstatement to valid program status.\n\n(2) If you determine that the violation of the regulations is a substantive one, and that the exchange visitor has failed to maintain valid program status for more than 120 days, then you must apply to us for reinstatement of the exchange visitor to valid program status. Your application must include:\n\n(i) Copies of all the exchange visitor's Forms DS-2019 issued to date;\n\n(ii) A new, completed Form DS-2019, showing in Block 3 the date for which reinstatement is sought, i.e., the new program end date;\n\n(iii) A copy of the receipt showing that the Pub. L. 104-208 fee has been paid; and,\n\n(iv) A written statement (together with documentary evidence supporting such statement):\n\n(A) Declaring that the exchange visitor is pursuing or was at all times intending to pursue the exchange visitor program activity for which the exchange visitor was admitted to the United States; and,\n\n(B) Showing that the exchange visitor failed to maintain valid program status due to circumstances beyond the control of the exchange visitor, or from administrative delay or oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect on your part or the exchange visitor's part; and,\n\n(C) Showing that it would be an unusual hardship to the exchange visitor if we do not grant the reinstatement to valid program status.\n\n(i) How will we notify you of our decision on your request for reinstatement? (1) If we deny your request for reinstatement, we will notify you by letter.\n\n(2) If we approve your request for reinstatement, we will notify you:\n\n(i) By stamping Box 6 on the new Form DS-2019 to show that reinstatement was granted, effective as of the date on which the application for reinstatement was received by the Exchange Visitor Program Services office; and\n\n(ii) By returning the new Form DS-2019 for the exchange visitor.\n\n(j) How long will it take us to act on your request for reinstatement? We will act on your request for reinstatement within forty-five days from the date on which we receive the request and supporting documentation.\n\n(k) Are you required to notify us each time that you correct a record? No special notification is necessary. Submission of the notification copy of Form DS-2019 to the Department of State serves as notice that a record has been corrected. Following the regulations in this part in issuing a letter or document serves as correction in the sponsor's file for those items not normally sent to the Department of State under existing notification procedures.\n\n[64 FR 44126, Aug. 13, 1999.

          "content": "§ 62.50   Sanctions.\n(a) Reasons for sanctions. The Department of State (Department) may impose sanctions against a sponsor upon a finding by its Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation (Office) that the sponsor has:\n\n(1) Violated one or more provisions of this Part;\n\n(2) Evidenced a pattern of failure to comply with one or more provisions of this Part;\n\n(3) Committed an act of omission or commission, which has or could have the effect of endangering the health, safety, or welfare of an exchange visitor; or\n\n(4) Otherwise conducted its program in such a way as to undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, compromise the national security interests of the United States, or bring the Department or the Exchange Visitor Program into notoriety or disrepute.\n\n(b) Lesser sanctions. (1) In order to ensure full compliance with the regulations in this Part, the Department, in its discretion and depending on the nature and seriousness of the violation, may impose any or all of the following sanctions (“lesser sanctions”) on a sponsor upon a finding that the sponsor engaged in any of the acts or omissions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:\n\n(i) A written reprimand to the sponsor, with a warning that repeated or persistent violations of the regulations in this part may result in suspension or revocation of the sponsor's Exchange Visitor Program designation, or other sanctions as set forth herein;\n\n(ii) A declaration placing the exchange visitor sponsor's program on probation, for a period of time determined by the Department in its discretion, signifying a pattern of violation of regulations such that further violations could lead to suspension or revocation of the sponsor's Exchange Visitor Program designation, or other sanctions as set forth herein;\n\n(iii) A corrective action plan designed to cure the sponsor's violations; or\n\n(iv) Up to a 15 percent (15%) reduction in the authorized number of exchange visitors in the sponsor's program or in the geographic area of its recruitment or activity. If the sponsor continues to violate the regulations in this Part, the Department may impose subsequent additional reductions, in ten-percent (10%) increments, in the authorized number of exchange visitors in the sponsor's program or in the geographic area of its recruitment or activity.\n\n(2) Within ten (10) days after service of the written notice to the sponsor imposing any of the sanctions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the sponsor may submit to the Office a statement in opposition to or mitigation of the sanction. Such statement may not exceed 20 pages in length, double-spaced and, if appropriate, may include additional documentary material. Sponsors shall include with all documentary material an index of the documents and a summary of the relevance of each document presented. Upon review and consideration of such submission, the Office may, in its discretion, modify, withdraw, or confirm such sanction. All materials the sponsor submits will become a part of the sponsor's file with the Office.\n\n(3) The decision of the Office is the final Department decision with regard to lesser sanctions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.\n\n(c) Suspension. (1) Upon a finding that a sponsor has committed a serious act of omission or commission which has or could have the effect of endangering the health, safety, or welfare of an exchange visitor, or of damaging the national security interests of the United States, the Office may serve the sponsor with written notice of its decision to suspend the designation of the sponsor's program for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. Such notice must specify the grounds for the sanction and the effective date thereof, advise the sponsor of its right to oppose the suspension, and identify the procedures for submitting a statement of opposition thereto. Suspension under this paragraph need not be preceded by the imposition of any other sanction or notice.\n\n(2)(i) Within five (5) days after service of such notice, the sponsor may submit to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, or PDAS) a statement in opposition to the Office's decision. Such statement may not exceed 20 pages in length, double-spaced and, if appropriate, may include additional documentary material. A sponsor shall include with all documentary material an index of the documents and a summary of the relevance of each document presented. The submission of a statement in opposition to the Office's decision will not serve to stay the effective date of the suspension.\n\n(ii) Within five (5) days after receipt of, and upon consideration of, such opposition, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary shall confirm, modify, or withdraw the suspension by serving the sponsor with a written decision. Such decision must specify the grounds therefore, and advise the sponsor of the procedures for requesting review of the decision.\n\n(iii) All materials the sponsor submits will become a part of the sponsor's file with the Office.\n\n(3) The procedures for review of the decision of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary are set forth in paragraphs (d)(3) and (4), (g), and (h) of this section, except that the submission of a request for review will not serve to stay the suspension.\n\n(d) Revocation of designation. (1) Upon a finding of any act or omission set forth at paragraph (a) of this section, the Office may serve a sponsor with not less than thirty (30) days' written notice of its intent to revoke the sponsor's Exchange Visitor Program designation. Such notice must specify the grounds for the proposed sanction and its effective date, advise the sponsor of its right to oppose the proposed sanction, and identify the procedures for submitting a statement of opposition thereto.

The Office shall submit a statement in response, and shall provide the sponsor with a copy thereof.\n\n(iv) A statement in opposition to or mitigation of the proposed sanction, or statement in response thereto, may not exceed 25 pages in length, double-spaced and, if appropriate, may include additional documentary material. Any additional documentary material may include an index of the documents and a summary of the relevance of each document presented.\n\n(v) Upon consideration of such statements, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary shall modify, withdraw, or confirm the proposed sanction by serving the sponsor with a written decision. Such decision shall specify the grounds therefor, identify its effective date, advise the sponsor of its right to request a review, and identify the procedures for requesting such review.\n\n(vi) All materials the sponsor submits will become a part of the sponsor's file with the Office.\n\n(3) Within ten (10) days after service of such written notice of the decision of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, the sponsor may submit a request for review with the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. The submission of such request for review will serve to stay the effective date of the decision pending the outcome of the review.\n\n(4) Within ten (10) days after receipt of such request for review, the Department shall designate a panel of three Review Officers pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, and the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary shall forward to each panel member all notices, statements, and decisions submitted or provided pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of paragraph (d) of this section. Thereafter, the review will be conducted pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.\n\n(e) Denial of application for redesignation. Upon a finding of any act or omission set forth at paragraph (a) of this section, the Office may serve a sponsor with not less than thirty (30) days' written notice of its intent to deny the sponsor's application for redesignation. Such notice must specify the grounds for the proposed sanction and its effective date, advise the sponsor of its right to oppose the proposed sanction, and identify the procedures for submitting a statement of opposition thereto. Denial of redesignation under this section need not be preceded by the imposition of any other sanction or notice. The procedures for opposing a proposed denial of redesignation are set forth in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (g), and (h) of this section.\n\n(f) Responsible officers. The Office may direct a sponsor to suspend or revoke the appointment of a responsible officer or alternate responsible officer for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The procedures for suspending or revoking a responsible officer or alternate responsible officer are set forth at paragraphs (d), (g), and (h) of this section.\n\n(g) Review officers. A panel of three Review Officers shall hear a sponsor's request for review pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section. The Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs shall designate one senior official from an office reporting to him/her, other than from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, as a member of the Panel. The Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs and the Legal Adviser shall each designate one senior official from their bureaus as members of the Panel.\n\n(h) Review. The Review Officers may affirm, modify, or reverse the sanction imposed by the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. The following procedures shall apply to the review:\n\n(1) Upon its designation, the panel of Review Officers shall promptly notify the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and the sponsor in writing of the identity of the Review Officers and the address to which all communications with the Review Officers shall be directed.\n\n(2) Within fifteen (15) days after service of such notice, the sponsor may submit to the Review Officers four (4) copies of a statement identifying the grounds on which the sponsor asserts that the decision of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary should be reversed or modified. Any such statement may not exceed 25 pages in length, double-spaced; and any attachments thereto shall not exceed 50 pages. A sponsor shall include with all attachments an index of the documents and a summary of the relevance of each document presented. The Review Officers shall transmit one (1) copy of any such statement to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, who shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such statement, submit four (4) copies of a statement in response. Any such statement may not exceed 25 pages in length, double-spaced; and any attachments thereto shall not exceed 50 pages. The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary shall include with all attachments an index of the documents and a summary of the relevance of each document presented. The Review Officers shall transmit one (1) copy of any such statement to the sponsor. No other submissions may be made unless specifically authorized by the Review Officers.\n\n(3) If the Review Officers determine, in their sole discretion, that a meeting for the purpose of clarification of the written submissions should be held, they shall schedule a meeting to be held within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the last written submission. The meeting will be limited to no more than two (2) hours. The purpose of the meeting will be limited to the clarification of the written submissions. No transcript may be taken and no evidence, either through documents or by witnesses, will be received. The sponsor and the representative of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary may attend the meeting on their own behalf and may be accompanied by counsel.\n\n(4) Following the conclusion of the meeting, or the submission of the last written submission if no meeting is held, the Review Officers shall promptly review the submissions of the sponsor and the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, and shall issue a signed written decision within thirty (30) days, stating the basis for their decision. A copy of the decision will be delivered to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and the sponsor.\n\n(5) If the Review Officers decide to affirm or modify the sanction, a copy of their decision shall also be delivered to the Department of Homeland Security and to the Bureau of Consular Affairs of the Department of State. The Office, at its discretion, may further distribute the decision.\n\n(6) Unless otherwise indicated, the sanction, if affirmed or modified, is effective as of the date of the Review Officers' written decision, except in the case of suspension of program designation, which is effective as of the date specified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(i) Effect of suspension, revocation, or denial of redesignation. A sponsor against which an order of suspension, revocation, or denial of redesignation has become effective may not thereafter issue any Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status (Form DS-2019) or advertise, recruit for, or otherwise promote its program. Under no circumstances shall the sponsor facilitate the entry of an exchange visitor into the United States. An order of suspension, revocation, or denial of redesignation will not in any way diminish or restrict the sponsor's legal or financial responsibilities to existing program applicants or participants.\n\n(j) Miscellaneous—(1) Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these regulations, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. The last day of the period so computed is included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is fewer than eleven (11) days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal legal holidays are excluded in the computation.\n\n(2) Service of notice to sponsor. Service of notice to a sponsor pursuant to this section may be accomplished through written notice by mail, delivery, electronic mail, or facsimile, upon the president, chief executive officer, managing director, General Counsel, Responsible Officer, or Alternate Responsible Officer of the sponsor.\n\n\n\n[72 FR 72247, Dec. 20, 2007, as amended at 86 FR 50994, Sept. 14, 2021]",

A sponsor notifies the Department of its intent to terminate its designation voluntarily and withdraws its program in SEVIS via submission of a “cancel program” request. The sponsor's designation shall terminate upon submission of such notification. Such sponsor may apply for a new program designation.\n\n(b) Inactivity. A sponsor fails to comply with the minimum program size or duration requirements, as specified in § 62.8 (a) and (b), in any 12-month period. Such sponsor may apply for a new program designation.\n\n(c) Failure to file annual reports. A sponsor fails to file annual reports for two (2) consecutive years. Such sponsor is eligible to apply for a new program designation.\n\n(d) Failure to file an annual management audit. A sponsor fails to file an annual management audit, if such audits are required in the relevant program category. Such sponsor is eligible to apply for a new program designation upon the filing of the past due management audit.\n\n(e) Change in ownership or control. An exchange visitor program designation is not assignable or transferable. A major change in ownership or control automatically terminates the designation. However, the successor sponsor may apply for designation of the new entity, and it may continue to administer the exchange visitor activities of the previously-designated program while the application for designation is pending before the Department of State:\n\n(1) With respect to a for-profit corporation, a major change in ownership or control is deemed to have occurred when one third (33.33%) or more of its stock is sold or otherwise transferred within a 12-month period;\n\n(2) With respect to a not-for-profit corporation, a major change of control is deemed to have occurred when 51 percent (51%) or more of the board of trustees or other like body, vested with its management, is replaced within a 12-month period.\n\n(f) Non-compliance with other requirements. A sponsor fails to remain in compliance with Federal, State, local, or professional requirements necessary to carry out the activity for which it is designated, including loss of accreditation, or licensure.\n\n(g) Failure to apply for redesignation. A sponsor fails to apply for redesignation, pursuant to the terms and conditions of § 62.7, prior to the conclusion of its current designation period. If so terminated, the former sponsor may apply for a new program designation, but the program activity will be suspended during the pendency of the application.",

Funds, once approved, may be expended for:\n\n(1) Medical examination, when required;\n\n(2) Emergency treatment;\n\n(3) Non-elective surgery;\n\n(4) Medications and related medical supplies and equipment required on a routine basis to sustain life;\n\n(5) Preventive or protective medications and medical supplies and equipment (vaccinations, inoculations, etc.) required to combat epidemic conditions (general or intramural);\n\n(6) Childbirth attendance, including necessary medical care of newborn children; and\n\n(7) Within the consular district, transportation for the U.S. national and attendant(s) designated by incarcerating officials between the place of incarceration and the place(s) of treatment.\n\n(c) Consular responsibility. As soon as the consular officer is aware that a U.S. national prisoner in the consular district faces a medical crisis, the officer should take the following actions, setting forth the order or priority based on an evaluation of the facts received:\n\n(1) Make every effort to contact the ill or injured prisoner as soon as possible;\n\n(2) Take steps to obtain a professional medical diagnosis and prognosis of the ill or injured prisoner;\n\n(3) Determine as accurately as possible the estimated costs of recommended treatment or surgery;\n\n(4) Obtain the names and addreses of family or friends who might serve as a source of private funds for medical services, and attempt to obtain the necessary funds;\n\n(5) Request the prisoner to execute a promissory note, since funds expended by the Department to cover medical services normally are on a reimbursable basis; and\n\n(6) Submit the above information, along with recommendations and evaluations, to the Department for approval and authorization.\n\n(d) Emergency expenditure authorization.

If one accredited agency or approved person is providing all adoption services by itself, it must act as the primary provider. If just one accredited agency or approved person is involved in providing adoption services, the sole accredited agency or approved person must act as the primary provider. If adoption services in the intercountry adoption case are being provided by more than one accredited agency or approved person, the agency or person that has child placement responsibility, as evidenced by the following, must act as the primary provider throughout the case:\n\n(1) Entering into placement contracts with prospective adoptive parent(s) to provide child referral and placement;\n\n(2) Accepting custody from a birth parent or other legal custodian in a foreign country for the purpose of placement for adoption;\n\n(3) Assuming responsibility for liaison with a foreign country's Central Authority or its designees with regard to arranging an adoption; or\n\n(4) Receiving from or sending to a foreign country information about a child that is under consideration for adoption, unless acting as a local service provider that conveys such information to parent(s) on behalf of the primary provider.\n\n(b) Pursuant to § 96.44, in the case of accredited agencies or approved persons, the primary provider may only use the following to provide adoption services in the United States:\n\n(1) A supervised provider, including an accredited agency or approved person;\n\n(2) An exempted provider, if the exempted provider's home study or child background study will be reviewed and approved by an accredited agency pursuant to § 96.47(c) or § 96.53(b); or\n\n(3) A public domestic authority.\n\n(c) Pursuant to § 96.44 of subpart F, in the case of accredited agencies or approved persons, the primary provider may only use the following to provide adoption services in a foreign country:\n\n(1) A Central Authority, competent authority, or a public foreign authority;\n\n(2) A foreign supervised provider, including a provider accredited by the foreign country; or\n\n(3) A foreign provider (agency, person, or other non-governmental entity) who\n\n(i) Has secured or is securing the necessary consent to termination of parental rights and to adoption, if the primary provider verifies consent pursuant to § 96.46(c); or\n\n(ii) Has prepared or is preparing a background study on a child in a case involving immigration to the United States (incoming case) or a home study on prospective adoptive parent(s) in a case involving emigration from the United States (outgoing case), and a report on the results of such a study, if the primary provider verifies the study and report pursuant to § 96.46(c).\n\n(d) The primary provider is not required to provide supervision or to assume responsibility for:\n\n(1) Public domestic authorities; or\n\n(2) Central Authorities, competent authorities, and public foreign authorities.\n\n(e) The primary provider must adhere to the standards contained in § 96.45 (Using supervised providers in the United States) when using supervised providers in the United States and the applicable standards contained in § 96.46 (Using providers in foreign countries) when using providers outside the United States.\n\n[71 FR 8131, Feb. 15, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 40633, July 14, 2014; 80 FR 7323, Feb. 10, 2015]",

          "content": "§ 96.15   Examples.\nThe following examples illustrate the rules of §§ 96.12 to 96.14: \n\n\nExample 1.Identifying a child for adoption and arranging an adoption. Agency X identifies children eligible for adoption in the United States on a TV program in an effort to recruit prospective adoptive parent(s). A couple in a foreign country calls Agency X about one of the children. Agency X refers them to an agency or person in the United States who arranges intercountry adoptions. Agency X does not require accreditation, temporarily accreditation, approval or supervision because it is not both identifying and arranging the adoption. In contrast, Agency Y, located in the United States, provides information about children eligible for adoption in a foreign country on a website and then arranges for interested U.S. parents to adopt those children. Agency Y must be accredited, approved, or supervised because, in addition to identifying children eligible for adoption, it is also helping to arrange the adoption.\n\nExample 2.Child welfare services exemption. Doctor X evaluates the medical records and a video of Child Y. The evaluation will be used in an intercountry adoption as part of the placement of Child Y and is the only service that Doctor X provides in the United States with regard to Child Y's adoption. Doctor X (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) does not need to be approved or supervised because she is not providing an adoption service as defined in § 96.2.\n\nExample 3.Home study exemption. Social Worker X, in the United States, (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) interviews Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, obtains a criminal background study, and checks the references of Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, then composes a report and submits the report to an accredited agency for use in an intercountry adoption. Social Worker X does not provide any other services to Prospective Adoptive Parent Y. Social Worker X qualifies as an exempted provider and therefore need not be approved or operate as supervised provider. In contrast, Social Worker Z, in the United States, (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) prepares a home study report for Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) W, and in addition re-enters the house after Child V has been placed with Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) W to assess how V and W are adjusting to life as a family. This assessment is post-placement monitoring, which is an adoption service. Therefore, Social Worker Z would need to become approved before providing this assessment for this intercountry adoption or else operate as a supervised provider. If an agency or person provides an adoption service in addition to a home study or child background study, the agency or person needs to become accredited, approved, or supervised before providing that adoption service.\n\nExample 4.Child background study exemption. An employee of Agency X interviews Child Y in the United States and compiles a report concerning Child Y's social and developmental history for use in an intercountry adoption. Agency X provides no other adoption services on behalf of Child Y. Agency X does not need to be accredited, approved, or supervised. Agency X is only conducting and creating a child background study, and therefore is an exempted provider. In contrast, an employee of Agency Z interviews Child W in the United States and creates a child background study for use in an intercountry adoption. Agency Z subsequently identifies prospective adoptive parent(s) and arranges a new adoption when Child W's previous adoption becomes disrupted. Agency Z needs to be accredited, approved, or supervised before providing this service. If an agency or person provides an adoption service in addition to a child background study or home study, the agency or person needs to be accredited, approved, or supervised before providing the additional service.\n\nExample 5.Home study and child welfare services exemptions. Agency X interviews Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, obtains a criminal background check, checks the references of Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, then composes a home study and submits it to an accredited agency for use in an intercountry adoption in the United States. Parent Y later joins a post-adoption support group for adoptive parents sponsored by Agency X. If Agency X performs no other adoption services, Agency X does not need to be accredited, approved, or supervised. If an agency or person provides a home study or child background study as well as other services in the United States that do not require accreditation, approval, or supervision, and no other adoption services, the agency or person is an exempted provider.\n\nExample 6.Exempted provider. Agency X interviews Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y, obtains a criminal background check, checks the references of Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y, and then composes a home study and submits the report to an accredited agency. In addition, Agency X interviews Child Z and compiles a report concerning Child Z's social and developmental history. All of Agency X's work is done in the United States. Both reports will be used in an intercountry adoption. If Agency X performs no other adoption services, Agency X does not need to be accredited, approved, or supervised. If an agency or person provides a home study and child background study as well as other services that do not require accreditation, approval or supervision, and no other adoption services, the agency or person is an exempted provider.\n\nExample 7.Legal services exemption. Attorney X (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) provides advice and counsel to Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y on filling out DHS paperwork required for an intercountry adoption. Among other papers, Attorney X prepares an affidavit of consent to termination of parental rights and to adoption of Child W to be signed by the birth mother in the United States. Attorney X must be approved or supervised because securing consent to termination of parental rights is an adoption service. In contrast, Attorney Z (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) assists Adoptive Parent(s) T to complete an adoption in the State in which they reside, after they have been granted an adoption in Child V's foreign country of origin. Attorney Z is exempt from approval or supervision because she is providing legal services, but no adoption services.\n\nExample 8.Post-placement monitoring. A court in a foreign country has granted custody of Child W to Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y pending the completion of W's adoption. Agency X interviews both Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y and Child W in their home in the United States. Agency X gathers information on the adjustment of Child W as a member of the family and inquires into the social and educational progress of Child W. Agency X must be accredited, approved, or supervised. Agency X's activities constitute post-placement monitoring, which is an adoption service. In contrast, if Person Z provided counseling for Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y and/or Child W, but provided no adoption services in the United States to the family, Person Z would not need to be approved or supervised. Post-placement counseling is different than post-placement monitoring because it does not relate to evaluating the adoption placement. Post-placement counseling is not an adoption service and does not trigger the accreditation/approval requirements of the IAA or the UAA and this part.\n\nExample 9.Post-adoption services. Foreign Country H requires that post-adoption reports be completed and sent to its Central Authority every year until adopted children reach the age of 18. Agency X provides support groups and a newsletter for U.S. parents that have adopted children from Country H and encourages parents to complete their post-adoption reports annually. Agency X does not need to be accredited, approved, or supervised because it is providing only post-adoption services. Post-adoption services are not included in the definition of adoption services, and therefore, do not trigger accreditation/approval requirements of the IAA or the UAA and this part.\n\nExample 10.Assuming custody and providing services after a disruption. Agency X provides counseling for Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y and for Child W pending the completion of Child W's intercountry adoption. The adoption eventually disrupts. Agency X helps recruit and identify new prospective adoptive parent(s) for Child W, but it is Agency P that assumes custody of Child W and places him in foster care until an alternative adoptive placement can be found. Agency X is not required to be accredited, approved, or supervised because it is not providing an adoption service in the United States as defined in § 96.2. Agency P, on the other hand, is providing an adoption service and would have to be accredited, approved, or supervised.\n\nExample 11.Making non-judicial determinations of best interest of child and appropriateness of adoptive placement of child. Agency X receives information about and a videotape of Child W from the institution where Child W lives in a foreign country. Based on the age, sex, and health problems of Child W, Agency X matches Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y with Child W. Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y receive a referral from Agency X and agree to accept the referral and proceed with the adoption of Child W. Agency X determines that Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y are a good placement for Child W and notifies the competent authority in W's country of origin that it has found a match for Child W and will start preparing adoption paperwork. All of Agency X's services are provided in the United States. Agency X is performing an adoption service and must be accredited, approved, or supervised.\n\nExample 12.Securing necessary consent to termination of parental rights and to adoption. Facilitator Y is accredited by Convention Country Z. He has contacts at several orphanages in Foreign Country Z and helps Agency X match children eligible for adoption with prospective adoptive parent(s) in the United States. Facilitator Y works with the institution that is the legal guardian of Child W in order to get the documents showing the institution's legal consent to the adoption of Child W. Agency X is the only U.S. agency providing adoption services in the case. Agency X must be accredited, or approved and must either treat Facilitator Y as a foreign supervised provider in accordance with § 96.46(a) and (b) or verify the consents Facilitator Y secured, in accordance with § 96.46(c).\n[71 FR 8131, Feb. 15, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 40634, July 14, 2014]",

Once the agency or person has been accredited or approved pursuant to this part, the accrediting entity must, for the purposes of monitoring, renewal, enforcement, and reapplication after adverse action, consider the agency's or person's actual performance in deciding whether the agency or person is in substantial compliance with the standards in subpart F of this part, unless the accrediting entity determines that it is still necessary to measure capacity because services have not yet been provided and thus adequate evidence of actual performance is not available.\n\n(c) The standards contained in subpart F of this part apply during all the stages of accreditation and approval, including, but not limited to, when the accrediting entity is evaluating an applicant for accreditation or approval, when it is determining whether to renew an agency's or person's accreditation or approval, when it is monitoring the performance of an accredited agency or approved person, and when it is taking adverse action against an accredited agency or approved person. Except as provided in § 96.25 and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, the accrediting entity may only use the standards contained in subpart F of this part, when determining whether an agency or person may be granted or permitted to maintain accreditation or approval.\n\n(d) The Secretary will ensure that each accrediting entity performs its accreditation and approval functions using only a method approved by the Secretary that is substantially the same as the method approved for use by each other accrediting entity. Each such method will include: an assigned value for each standard (or element of a standard); a method of rating an agency's or person's compliance with each applicable standard; and a method of evaluating whether an agency's or person's overall compliance with all applicable standards establishes that the agency or person is in substantial compliance with the standards and can be accredited or approved. The Secretary will ensure that the value assigned to each standard reflects the relative importance of that standard to compliance with the Convention, the IAA, and the UAA and is consistent with the value assigned to the standard by other accrediting entities. The accrediting entity must advise applicants of the value assigned to each standard (or elements of each standard) at the time it provides applicants with the application materials.\n\n(e) If an agency or person previously has been denied accreditation or approval, has withdrawn its application in anticipation of denial, or is reapplying for accreditation or approval after cancellation, refusal to renew, or temporary debarment, the accrediting entity must take the reasons underlying such actions into account when evaluating the agency or person for accreditation or approval, and may deny accreditation or approval on the basis of the previous action.\n\n(f) If an agency or person that has an ownership or control interest in the applicant, as that term is defined in section 1124 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-3), has been debarred pursuant to § 96.85, the accrediting entity must take into account the reasons underlying the debarment when evaluating the agency or person for accreditation or approval, and may deny accreditation or approval or refuse to renew accreditation or approval on the basis of the debarment.\n\n(g) The standards contained in subpart F of this part do not eliminate the need for an agency or person to comply fully with the laws of jurisdictions in which it operates. An agency or person must provide adoption services in intercountry adoption cases consistent with the laws of any State in which it operates, and with the Convention, the IAA, and the UAA. Persons that are approved to provide adoption services may only provide such services in States that do not prohibit persons from providing adoption services. Nothing in the application of this subpart E and subpart F of this part should be construed to require a State to allow persons to provide adoption services if State law does not permit them to do so.",

(1) If, after being advised by the lead agency pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the United States National Authority, in coordination with the interagency group designated by the President to implement the provisions of the CWCIA, determines that all of the conditions of paragraph (d) are satisfied and that a sample shall be required, then the owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises shall provide a sample pursuant to a request of the Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat.\n\n(2) If, however, after being advised by the lead agency pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the United States National Authority, in coordination with the interagency group designated by the President to implement the provisions of the CWCIA, determines that any of the conditions of paragraph (d) are not satisfied and that a sample shall not be required, then the owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises shall not be required to provide a sample pursuant to a request of the Inspection Team of the Technical Secretariat.\n\n(f) Person to take a sample. If a sample is required, the owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the inspected premises will determine whether the sample will be taken by a representative of the premises, the Inspection Team, or any other individual present. The owner or the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the inspected premises may elect to have a representative present during the taking of a sample.\n\n(g) Requirement that samples remain in the United States. No sample collected in the United States pursuant to an inspection permitted by the CWCIA may be transferred for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the United States.\n\n(h) Handling of samples. Samples will be handled in accordance with the Convention, the CWCIA, other applicable law, and the provisions of any applicable facility agreement.\n\n(i) Failure to comply with this section. Failure by any person to comply with this section may be treated as a violation of section 306 of the Act and section 103.5(a).\n\n(j) Conditions that restrict sampling activities during challenge inspections. During challenge inspections within the inspected premises the Host Team may negotiate conditions that restrict activities regarding sampling, e.g., conditions that restrict where, when, and how samples are taken, whether samples are removed from the site, and how samples are analyzed.\n\n(k) Format of Inspection Team request. It is the policy of the United States Government that Inspection Team requests for samples should be in written form from the head of the Inspection Team. When necessary, before a sample is required to be provided, the Host Team Leader should seek a written request from the head of the Inspection Team.\n\n(l) Requirement to provide a sample in the band around the outside of the perimeter during a challenge inspection. In a band, not to exceed a width of 50 meters, around the outside of the perimeter of the inspected site, the Inspection Team, during a challenge inpsection, may take wipes, air, soil or effluent samples where either:\n\n(1) There is consent; or\n\n(2) Such activity is authorized by a search warrant obtained pursuant to section 305(b)(4) of the CWCIA.",

The Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, may request that the Secretary initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding under this section and 15 CFR 719.5. If the request is in accordance with applicable law, the Secretary will initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding by issuing a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA). The Office of Chief Counsel for Export Administration, Department of Commerce shall serve the NOVA as directed by the Secretary.\n\n(b) Content of NOVA. The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint, and will set forth the basis for the issuance of the proposed order. It will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed. The NOVA will inform the respondent of the right to request a hearing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and the CWCR (15 CFR parts 710 through 722) at 15 CFR 719.6, inform the respondent that failure to request such a hearing shall result in the proposed order becoming final and unappealable on signature of the Secretary of State, and provide payment instructions. A copy of the regulations that govern the administrative proceedings will accompany the NOVA.\n\n(c) Proposed order. A proposed order shall accompany every NOVA. It will briefly set forth the substance of the alleged violation(s) and the statutory, regulatory or other provisions violated. It will state the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed.\n\n(d) Notice. The Secretary shall notify, via the Department of Commerce, the respondent (or respondent's agent for service of process or attorney) of the initiation of administrative proceedings by sending, via first class mail, facsimile, or by personal delivery, the relevant documents.\n\n(e) Time to answer. If the respondent wishes to contest the NOVA and proposed order issued by the Secretary, the respondent must request a hearing in writing within 15 days from the date of the NOVA. If the respondent requests a hearing, the respondent must answer the NOVA within 30 days from the date of the request for hearing. The request for hearing and answer must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), along with a copy of the NOVA and proposed order, and served on the Office of Chief Counsel for Export Administration, Department of Commerce, and any other address(es) specified in the NOVA, in accordance with 15 CFR 719.8.\n\n(f) Content of answer. The respondent's answer must be responsive to the NOVA and proposed order, and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's defense(s). The answer must specifically admit or deny each separate allegation in the NOVA; if the respondent is without knowledge, the answer will so state and will operate as a denial. Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed an admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any additional or new matter the respondent believes supports a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon may be refused, except for good cause shown.\n\n(g) English required. The request for hearing, answer, and all other papers and documentary evidence must be submitted in English.\n\n(h) Waiver. The failure of the respondent to file a request for a hearing and an answer within the times provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations set forth in the NOVA and proposed order. If no hearing is requested and no answer is provided, the Secretary will sign the proposed order, which shall, upon signature, become final and unappealable.\n\n(i) Administrative procedures.

Any party may, within 7 days of the Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) certification of the initial decision and order, petition the Secretary for review of the initial decision. A petition for review shall be addressed to and served on the Executive Director of the Office of the Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, N.W., Room 5519, Washington D.C. 20520, and shall also be served on the Chief Counsel for Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room H-3839, Washington, D.C. 20230, and on the respondent. Petitions for review may be filed only on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(i) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or not supported by substantial evidence of record;\n\n(ii) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to law;\n\n(iii) That a prejudicial procedural error has occurred; or\n\n(iv) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\n\n(2) Content of petition for review. The petition must specifically set forth the grounds on which review is requested and be supported by citations to the record, statutes, regulations, and principal authorities.\n\n(3) Decision to review. Review of the initial decision by the Secretary is discretionary, and is not a matter of right. The Secretary shall accept or decline review of the initial decision and order within 3 days after a petition for review is filed. If no such petition is filed, the Secretary may, on his or her own initiative, notify the parties within 10 days after the ALJ's certification of the initial decision and order that he or she intends to exercise his or her discretion to review the initial decision.\n\n(4) Effect of decision to review. The initial decision is stayed until further order of the Secretary upon a timely petition for review, or upon action to review taken by the Secretary on his or her own initiative.\n\n(5) Review declined. If the Secretary declines to exercise discretionary review, such order, and the resulting final agency decision, will be served on all parties personally, by overnight mail, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The Secretary need not give reasons for declining review.\n\n(6) Review accepted. If the Secretary grants a petition for review or decides to review the initial decision on his or her own initiative, he or she will issue an order confirming that acceptance and specifying any issues to be briefed by all parties within 10 days after the order. Briefing shall be limited to the issues specified in the order. Only those issues specified in the order will be considered by the Secretary. The parties may, within 5 days after the filing of any brief of the issues, file and serve a reply to that brief. The Department of Commerce shall review all written submissions, and, based on the record, make a recommendation to the Secretary as to whether the ALJ's initial decision should be modified or vacated. The Secretary will make a final decision within 30 days after the ALJ's certification of the initial decision and order.\n\n(b) Final decision. Unless the Secretary, within 30 days after the date of the ALJ's certification of the initial decision and order, modifies or vacates the decision and order, with or without conditions, the ALJ's initial decision and order shall become effective as the final decision and order of the United States Government. If the Secretary does modify or vacate the initial decision and order, that decision and order of the Secretary shall become the final decision and order of the United States Government. The final decision and order shall be served on the parties and will be made available to the public.\n\n(c) Computation of time for the purposes of this section. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this section, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. The last day of the period is computed to be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less.",

If, following the issuance of such a letter of intent to charge, the Department of Commerce and respondent reach an agreement to settle a case, the Department of Commerce will recommend the proposed settlement to the Secretary.

No action is required by the ALJ in cases where the Secretary approves and signs such a settlement agreement and order.\n\n(2) Refusal to approve settlement. If the Secretary refuses to approve the recommended settlement, the Secretary will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal had been made.\n\n(b) Settlements following issuance of a NOVA—(1) Approval of settlement. When the Department of Commerce and respondent reach an agreement to settle a case after administrative proceedings have been initiated before an ALJ, the Department of Commerce will recommend the settlement to the Secretary of State.

If the Secretary of State refuses to approve the recommended settlement, the Secretary will notify the parties of the disapproval, and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal had been made.\n\n(c) Scope of settlement. Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought pursuant to this part. This reflects the fact that the Government officials involved have neither the authority nor the responsibility for initiating, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings.

It may also be used for consideration of a redesignation of an article or service currently covered by the USML. The Department must provide notice to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the USML.\n\n(b) The procedure for submitting a Commodity Jurisdiction Determination Request to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is set forth in § 120.12.",

          "content": "§ 120.5   Relation to regulations of other agencies.\n(a) The Department of Justice, the U.S. Munitions Import List (USMIL), and permanent imports. Defense articles and defense services covered by the U.S. Munitions List set forth in this subchapter are regulated by the Department of State (see also § 120.2) for purposes of export, reexport, retransfer, and temporary import. The President has delegated the authority to control the permanent import of defense articles and services to the Attorney General. The defense articles and services controlled by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General collectively comprise the U.S. Munitions List under the Arms Export Control Act. As the Attorney General exercises independent delegated authority to designate defense articles and services for purposes of permanent import controls, the permanent import control list administered by the Department of Justice has been separately labeled the U.S. Munitions Import List (27 CFR part 447) to distinguish it from the list set out in this subchapter. In carrying out the functions delegated to the Attorney General pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, the Attorney General shall be guided by the views of the Secretary of State on matters affecting world peace and the external security and foreign policy of the United States.\n\n(b) The Department of Commerce and the Export Administration Regulations—(1) Export of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations by authority of the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce regulates the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items on the Commerce Control List and other items subject to its jurisdiction, as well as certain activities performed by U.S. persons, including those that may contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 730 through 774).\n\n(2) Export of items subject to the EAR by authority of the Department of State. A license or other approval (see § 120.57) from the Department of State granted in accordance with this subchapter may also authorize the export of items subject to the EAR (see § 120.58). An exemption (see § 120.57 and parts 123, 124, 125, and 126 of this subchapter) may only be used to export an item subject to the EAR that is for use in or with a defense article and is included in the same shipment as any defense article. Separate approval from the Department of Commerce is not required for these items. No exemption under this subchapter may be utilized to export an item subject to the EAR if not accompanied by a defense article. Those items subject to the EAR exported pursuant to a Department of State license or other approval would remain under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce for any subsequent transactions. The inclusion of items subject to the EAR on a Department of State license or other approval does not change the licensing jurisdiction of the items.\n\n(c) Nuclear related controls; Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (1) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to articles, technical data, or services in Category VI, Category XV, Category XVI, and Category XX of § 121.1 of this subchapter to the extent that exports of such articles, technical data, or services are controlled by the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, as amended, or are government transfers authorized pursuant to these Acts. For Department of Commerce controls, see 15 CFR 742.3 and 744.2, administered pursuant to Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2139a(c)), and 15 CFR 744.5, which are not subject to this subchapter.\n\n(2) The transfer of materials, including special nuclear materials, nuclear parts of nuclear weapons, or other, non-nuclear parts of nuclear weapons systems involving Restricted Data or of assistance involving any person directly or indirectly engaging in the production or use thereof is prohibited except as authorized by the AEA. The transfer of Restricted Data or such assistance is prohibited except as authorized by the AEA. The technical data or defense services relating to nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems or related defense purposes (and such data or services relating to applications of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, or related research and development) may constitute Restricted Data or such assistance, subject to the foregoing prohibition.\n\n(3) A license for the export of a defense article, technical data, or the furnishing of a defense service relating to defense articles referred to in Category VI(e) or Category XX(b)(1) of § 121.1 of this subchapter will not be granted unless the defense article, technical data, or defense service comes within the scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the AEA with the government of the country to which the defense article, technical data, or defense service is to be exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an agreement only:\n\n(i) If the proposed export involves an article which is identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power plant;\n\n(ii) If the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear propulsion; and\n\n(iii) If it is not for use in a naval propulsion plant.",

Such documents may include concept design information, marketing plans, declarations in patent applications, or contracts. Absent such documents, the commodity may not be excluded from being specially designed by either paragraph (b)(4) or (5).\n\nNote 3 to paragraph (b):\nFor the purpose of paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, “knowledge” includes not only the positive knowledge a circumstance exists or is substantially certain to occur, but also an awareness of a high probability of its existence or future occurrence. Such awareness is inferred from evidence of the conscious disregard of facts known to a person and is also inferred from a person's willful avoidance of facts.",

          "content": "§ 120.42   Form, fit, function, performance capability, equivalent, enumerated, and catch-all control.\n(a) Form. The form of a commodity is defined by its configuration (including the geometrically measured configuration), material, and material properties that uniquely characterize it. For software, the form means the design, logic flow, and algorithms.\n\n(b) Fit. The fit of a commodity is defined by its ability to physically interface or connect with or become an integral part of another commodity. For software, the fit is defined by its ability to interface or connect with a defense article.\n\n(c) Function. The function of a commodity is the action or actions it is designed to perform. For software, the function means the action or actions the software performs directly related to a defense article or as a standalone application.\n\n(d) Performance capability. Performance capability is the measure of a commodity's effectiveness to perform a designated function in a given environment (e.g., measured in terms of speed, durability, reliability, pressure, accuracy, efficiency). For software, performance capability means the measure of the software's effectiveness to perform a designated function.\n\n(e) Equivalent. With respect to a commodity, equivalent means its form has been modified solely for fit purposes.\n\n(f) Enumerated. Enumerated refers to any item designated on the U.S. Munitions List or item on the Commerce Control List and not in a catch-all control.\n\n(g) Catch-all control. A catch-all control is one that does not refer to specific types of parts, components, accessories, or attachments, but rather controls unspecified parts, components, accessories, or attachments only if they were specially designed for an enumerated item.",

          "content": "§ 120.43   Development, production, and related terms; Basic and applied research.\n(a) Development is related to all stages prior to serial production, such as design, design research, design analyses, design concepts, assembly and testing of prototypes, pilot production schemes, design data, process of transforming design data into a product, configuration design, integration design, and layouts. Development includes modification of an existing design.\n\n(b)(1) Production means all production stages, such as product engineering, manufacture, integration, assembly (mounting), inspection, testing, and quality assurance. This includes serial production where commodities have passed production readiness testing (i.e., an approved, standardized design ready for large scale production) and have been or are being produced on an assembly line for multiple commodities using the approved, standardized design.\n\n(2) Commodities in production that are subsequently subject to development activities, such as those that would result in enhancements or improvements only in the reliability or maintainability of the commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between failure), including those pertaining to quality improvements, cost reductions, or feature enhancements, remain in production. However, any new models or versions of such commodities developed from such efforts that change the basic performance or capability of the commodity are in development until and unless they enter into production.\n\n(c) Design methodology includes the underlying engineering methods and design philosophy utilized (i.e., information that explains the rationale for a particular design decision, engineering feature, or performance requirement); engineering experience (e.g., lessons learned); and the rationale and associated databases (e.g., design allowables, factors of safety, component life predictions, failure analysis criteria) that establish the operational requirements (e.g., performance, mechanical, electrical, electronic, reliability and maintainability) of a defense article. (Final analytical results and the initial conditions and parameters may be provided.)\n\n(d) Engineering analysis includes the analytical methods and tools used to design or evaluate a defense article's performance against the operational requirements. Analytical methods and tools include the development and/or use of mockups, computer models and simulations, and test facilities. (Final analytical results and the initial conditions and parameters may be provided.)\n\n(e) Manufacturing know-how includes information that provides detailed manufacturing processes and techniques needed to translate a detailed design into a qualified, finished defense article. (Information may be provided in a build-to-print package that is necessary in order to produce an acceptable defense article.)\n\n(f) Build-to-print means that a foreign consignee can produce a defense article from engineering drawings without any technical assistance from a U.S. exporter. This transaction is based strictly on a hands-off approach since the foreign consignee is understood to have the inherent capability to produce the defense article and only lacks the necessary drawings. Supporting documentation (e.g., acceptance criteria, object code software for numerically controlled machines) may be released on an as-required basis (i.e., must have) such that the foreign consignee would not be able to produce an acceptable defense article without this additional supporting documentation. Build-to-print does not include the release of any information which discloses design methodology, engineering analysis, detailed process information or manufacturing know-how. Documentation which is not absolutely necessary to permit manufacture of an acceptable defense article (i.e. nice to have) is not considered within the boundaries of a build-to-print data package.\n\n(g) Build/design-to-specification means that a foreign consignee can design and produce a defense article from requirement specifications without any technical assistance from the U.S. exporter. This transaction is based strictly on a hands-off approach since the foreign consignee is understood to have the inherent capability to both design and produce the defense article and only lacks the necessary requirement information.\n\n(h) Basic research means a systemic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. It does not include applied research.\n\n(i) Applied research means a systemic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met. It is a systematic application of knowledge toward the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.",

This includes modifications, enhancements, or upgrades that would result in improving only the reliability or maintainability of the commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between failure) and does not enhance the basic performance or capability of the defense article.\n\n(c) Depot-level maintenance is third-level maintenance performed on- or off-equipment at or by a major repair facility, shipyard, or field team, each with necessary equipment and personnel of requisite technical skill. It consists of providing evaluation or repair beyond unit or organization capability. This maintenance consists of inspecting, testing, calibrating, repairing, overhauling, refurbishing, reconditioning, and one-to-one replacing of any defective parts, components, or assemblies.

The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B and must submit additional information to verify its eligibility upon order by the adjudicative officer.\n\n(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:\n\n(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $1 million;\n\n(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;\n\n(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;\n\n(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and\n\n(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and not more than 500 employees.\n\n(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.\n\n(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.\n\n(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.\n\n(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.\n\n(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.",

Ministry Y is a covered entity. However, Corporation X is not a covered entity because the contract is not a direct contract with an agency of the United States.\n(2) Under a $1,000,000 grant from the Department of State providing covered assistance, Corporation B makes a $120,000 subgrant to University Y for the training of 12 individuals. If Corporation B is located in or providing assistance within a covered country, it is a covered entity and the 12 individuals receiving participant training are covered individuals. University Y is not a covered entity.\n(3) University C, which is not located in a covered country, receives a $1 million regional assistance research project grant from the Agency for International development, $80,000 of which is provided for research in covered countries. University C is not a covered entity. (However, if $100,000 or more were provided for research in a covered country or countries, or if University C were located in a covered country, then University C would be a covered entity.)",

(1) The Country Narcotics Coordinator shall be responsible for establishing a system for reviewing available information regarding narcotics offense convictions and drug trafficking of proposed assistance recipients under this section and, except under the circumstances described in § 140.6(a)(6), determining whether a proposed recipient is to be denied such assistance or other measures are to be taken as a result of the application of FAA Section 487.\n\n(2) Prior to providing covered assistance to or through a proposed recipient, the agency providing the assistance shall provide the Country Narcotics Coordinator in the country in which the proposed recipient is located or, as appropriate, where assistance is to be provided, the information specified in § 140.6(a)(3) in order that the Country Narcotics Coordinator may carry out his or her responsibilities under this part.\n\n(3) In each case, the agency proposing the assistance shall provide to the Country Narcotics Coordinator the name of each key individual within the recipient entity who may be expected to control or benefit from assistance as well as other relevant identifying information (e.g., address, date of birth) that is readily available. If a question arises concerning who should be included within the group of key individuals of an entity, the agency providing the assistance shall consult with the Country Narcotics Coordinator, and the decision shall be made by the Country Narcotics Coordinator. If the agency proposing the assistance disagrees with the Country Narcotics Coordinator's decision regarding who should be included within the group of key individuals, the agency may request that the decision be reviewed by the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in consultation with other appropriate bureaus and agencies. Any such review undertaken by the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs shall be completed expeditiously.\n\n(4) Within fourteen calendar days after receiving the name of a proposed recipient and other relevant information, the Country Narcotics Coordinator shall determine whether any available information may warrant withholding assistance or taking other measures under this part, based on the criteria set forth in § 140.6(b). If, during that period, the Country Narcotics Coordinator determines that available information does not so indicate, he or she shall notify the proposing agency that the assistance may be provided to the proposed recipient.\n\n(5) If, during the initial fourteen-day period, the Country Narcotics Coordinator determines that information exists that may warrant withholding assistance or taking other measures under this part, then the Country Narcotics Coordinator shall have another fourteen calendar days to make a final determination whether the assistance shall be provided or withheld or such other measures taken.\n\n(6) A decision to withhold assistance or to take other measures based on information or allegations that a key individual who is a senior government official of the host nation has been convicted of a narcotics offense or has been engaged in drug trafficking shall be made by the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, or by a higher ranking official of the Department of State, in consultation with other appropriate bureaus and agencies. For the purpose of this part, “senior government official” includes host nation officials at or above the vice minister level, heads of host nation law enforcement agencies, and general or flag officers of the host nation armed forces.\n\n(b) Criteria to be applied. (1) A decision to withhold assistance or take other measures shall be based on knowledge or reason to believe that the proposed recipient, within the past ten years, has:\n\n(i) Been convicted of a narcotics offense as defined in this part; or\n\n(ii) Been engaged in drug trafficking, regardless of whether there has been a conviction.\n\n(2) Factors that may support a decision to withhold assistance or take other measures based on reason to believe that the proposed recipient has been engaged in drug trafficking activities within the past ten years when there has been no conviction of such an offense may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) Admission of participation in such activities;\n\n(ii) A long record of arrests for drug trafficking activities with an unexplained failure to prosecute by the local government;\n\n(iii) Adequate reliable information indicating involvement in drug trafficking.\n\n(3) If the Country Narcotics Coordinator knows or has reason to believe that a key individual (as described in § 140.6(a)(3)) within a proposed recipient entity has been convicted of a narcotics offense or has been engaged in drug trafficking under the terms of this part, the Country Narcotics Coordinator must then decide whether withholding assistance from the entity or taking other measures to structure the provision of assistance to meet the requirements of section 487 is warranted. This decision shall be made in consultation with the agency proposing the assistance and other appropriate bureaus and agencies. In making this determination, the Country Narcotics Coordinator shall take into account:\n\n(i) The extent to which such individual would have control over assistance received;\n\n(ii) The extent to which such individual could benefit personally from the assistance;\n\n(iii) Whether such individual has acted alone or in collaboration with others associated with the entity;\n\n(iv) The degree to which financial or other resources of the entity itself have been used to support drug trafficking; and\n\n(v) Whether the provision of assistance to the entity can be structured in such a way as to exclude from the effective control or benefit of the assistance any key individuals with respect to whom a negative determination has been made.\n\n(c) Violations identified subsequent to obligation. The foregoing procedures provide for a determination before funds are obligated. If, however, subsequent to an obligation of funds an assistance recipient or a key individual of such recipient is found to have been convicted of a narcotics offense or to have been engaged in drug trafficking (e.g., the head of a recipient entity changes during the course of an activity and the new head is found to have been engaged in drug trafficking), appropriate action should be taken, including, if necessary, termination of the assistance.

Procedures set forth in § 140.6(c) concerning violations identified subsequent to obligation shall apply to both U.S. and foreign non-governmental entities.\n\n\nExamples:(1) A $100,000 grant to a covered U.S. university for participant training would not be subject to the review procedures and criteria in § 140.6(a) and (b).

A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions. \n\n(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 142.6(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effect of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 142.6(b), or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: Provided, That: \n\n(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and \n\n(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that is will be used only in accordance with this part. \n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty.

This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.\n\n(b) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as the addition of equipment (e.g., telecommunication device for the deaf) redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirement of § 142.18, or any other method that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\n(c) Time period.

Either at the application stage or the award stage, Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial assistance or awards of Federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each education program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 146.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance. \n\n(b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity. \n\n(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property. \n\n(3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended. \n\n(c) Form. (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688). \n\n(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.",

In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.",

Nothing in this complaint process is intended to prevent Department personnel from addressing any alleged compliance issues when made aware of such requests directly or indirectly.\n\n(c) A Section 508 complaint must be filed not later than 180 calendar days after the complainant knew, or should have known, of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Department. A Section 508 complaint must be submitted in writing by fax, email, mail, or hand delivery to the S/OCR office, using the Form DS-4282, Discrimination Complaint Form, which can be downloaded at: https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds4282.PDF.\n\n(d) Once a Section 508 complaint has been received, S/OCR will conduct an investigation into the allegation(s) and render a decision as to whether a Section 508 violation has occurred.

If the Department needs additional information and is unable, after reasonable attempts for 30 days, to contact a complainant using his or her contact information, it may consider the complaint abandoned, and may close the complaint without action.

To accomplish this the responsible action officer must ensure that data developed during the review process is collected, analyzed and made available for consideration early in planning and decisionmaking when it will be most valuable in formulating, reviewing and deciding upon proposals for Departmental action. \n\n(b) Environmental analysis and review of a proposed Departmental action shall be conducted as early as practicable so as to be timely, yet late enough to be relevant to the decisionmaking. \n\n(c) Environmental documents should, whenever possible, accompany the principal action memorandum relating to a proposed action. An environmental document required in conjunction with conclusion of an international agreement shall, where possible, be prepared and circulated for review and comment before final negotiations begin. The completed environmental document should thus ordinarily accompany the principal action memorandum or request for authority to negotiate an agreement under the Department's Circular 175 regulation (11 FAM 720). \n\n(d) To the maximum extent possible an environmental document should be prepared before the establishment of a final United States position on a proposal. In such cases the document should indicate the alternatives under consideration without specifying a Departmental preference. If the content and dimensions of a proposed action will not be clear until after the conclusion of an international negotiation or if a decision to proceed on an action involving another nation or international organization is required on short notice and before the environmental document can be prepared, the environmental document should be prepared as soon as possible after the conclusion of an agreed text of a treaty or agreement on the proposed action. If the Senate's advice and consent to a treaty with potential significant environmental effects in the United States will be sought, the final environmental impact statement should accompany other decision documentation for ratification. Legislative environmental impact statements on proposed treaties or legislation shall conform to the requirements of § 1506.8 of the CEQ Regulations and must be prepared in time for Congressional hearings and deliberations. \n\n(e) Because actions having effects on the United States may to varying degrees be initiated, influenced and conducted by other countries, it is recognized that the preparation of environmental documents for such actions must be adjusted to meet a variety of circumstances. Bearing in mind the degree to which other countries possess information on and the ability to affect the decision under consideration, responsible action officers shall seek at all times to prepare environmental analysis documents as early as feasible in the decisionmaking process.",

In carrying out its responsibilities the Bureau shall: \n\n(i) Coordinate the formulation, development and revision of Departmental policies and positions on matters pertaining to environmental evaluation and review; \n\n(ii) Develop and ensure the implementation of Departmentwide standards, procedures and working relationships for environmental review and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; \n\n(iii) Develop, as an integral part of the Department's basic decision processes, procedures to ensure that environmental factors are properly considered in all relevant proposals and decisions; \n\n(iv) Monitor these processes to ensure that Departmental procedures are achieving their purposes; \n\n(v) Advise, assist and inform Departmental bureaus of the technical and management aspects of environmental analysis, and of the relevant expertise available in and outside the Department; \n\n(vi) Establish and maintain working relationships with the Council on Environmental Quality, Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal, State and local governmental agencies concerned with environmental matters; \n\n(vii) Represent the Department in working with other government agencies and organizations to formulate, revise and achieve uniform understanding and application of government-wide policies relating to the environment; \n\n(viii) Consolidate and transmit to the appropriate parties Departmental comments on environmental impact statements and other environmental reports prepared by other agencies; and \n\n(ix) Acquire information for and prepare other Departmental reports on environmental assessment matters. \n\n(3) Office of the Legal Adviser. The Office of the Legal Adviser is the principal Departmental authority on the legal aspects of environmental matters and the implementation of these regulations and shall advise and assist Departmental Bureaus in these matters. \n\n(4) Bureau Environmental Coordinators. Each Departmental bureau and major office shall designate an officer to act as coordinator, adviser and principal point of contact for environmental matters within the bureau. The bureau coordinator will advise and assist the bureau in implementing these regulations and serve as a member of the Departmental Committee of Environmental Coordinators. \n\n(5) Departmental Committee of Environmental Coordinators. A Departmental Committee of Environmental Coordinators shall be established to assist in coordinating Departmental implementation of these regulations; in providing advice on major issues, policies and procedures relating to the Department's implementation of environmental analysis requirements; and in ensuring general conformity of Departmental implementation practices. The Committee's responsibility will be to exchange information on the implementation of these regulations, assist bureaus in early identification of Departmental actions which should be analyzed for environmental effects and help to coordinate and provide the appropriate analysis. The Committee will be chaired by the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  and will be comprised of bureau and office coordinators designated by the respective bureaus and offices. \n\n(6) Outside contractors. Qualified outside contractors may be employed to assist Departmental officers in preparing environmental documents as required under these regulations. \n\n[45 FR 59554, Sept. 10, 1980, as amended at 85 FR 32296, May 29, 2020]",

          "content": "§ 161.7   Categories of actions.\nDepartmental officers shall review each major Departmental action having a potentially significant effect on the quality of the environment in the United States. The need to prepare formal environmental documents will depend on the scope of the action and the context and intensity of any environmental effects expected if the action is implemented. Departmental actions can generally be grouped into three categories, as follows: \n\n(a) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. Any Departmental action deemed to have a “significant effect upon the quality of the human environment” of the United States requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement. The criteria to be used in determining significance are set forth in § 1508.27 of the CEQ Regulations. The Department has reviewed representative actions and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. If developments later enable such designations to be made the Department will publish a description of proposed actions for such designation in the Federal Register. \n\n(b) Actions categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare environmental impact statements. Categorical exclusion, as defined in § 1508.4 of the CEQ Regulations, provides for exclusion from environmental review of specified actions which have as a class been found to have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is ordinarily required for such actions. Departmental actions categorically excluded from the requirements of these regulations include the following: \n\n(1) Routine conduct of Departmental and overseas political and economic functions, including reporting on political and economic developments, trends and activities, communicating to host governments United States Government views, maintaining contact with foreign officials and individuals, and facilitating trade opportunities abroad and U.S. business expansion in foreign markets; \n\n(2) Provision of consular services—visas, passports and citizenship, and special consular services, such as issuing or reviewing passports and visas, taking legal depositions, notarizing absentee ballots and other documents and delivering retirement checks, social security payments and veterans benefits; \n\n(3) Conduct of routine administrative functions, such as budget and finance, personnel and general services. This includes routine administrative procurements (e.g., general supplies, negotiating leases for office space or staff housing, ordering supplies and arranging for customs clearances); financial transactions, including salaries, expenses and grants; routine management, formulation and allocation of the Department's budget at all levels (this does not exempt the preparation of environmental documents for proposals included in the Department's budget when required); and personnel actions (e.g., promotions, hirings, and counseling American and host country employees who work for the Department of State); \n\n(4) Preparing for and participating in conferences, workshops or meetings for information exchange, data collection or research or study activities; and \n\n(5) Document and information exchanges.\n\nEven though an action may be categorically excluded from the need for an environmental impact statement, if information developed during the planning for the actions indicates the possibility that the particular action in question may nonetheless cause significant environmental effects, an environmental assessment shall be prepared to evaluate those effects. Based upon the assessment, a determination will be made whether to prepare an environmental impact statement. The Department may designate additional actions for categorical exclusion by publishing a listing of actions proposed for such designation in the Federal Register. \n\n(c) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments. An environmental assessment shall provide the basis of the determination whether an environmental impact statement is required. A Departmental action shall require the preparation of an environmental assessment if the action is not one known normally to require an environmental impact statement and is not categorically excluded. Departmental actions normally included in this category are actions for which the Department has lead-agency responsibility and which may significantly affect the human environment of the United States, such as those actions involving: \n\n(1) [Reserved]\n\n(2) Wetlands, floodplains, endangered species and national historical, archeological and recreational sites (see also specific requirements for environmental review and consultation in § 161.11 of these regulations); and \n\n(3) Ocean dumping, control of toxic substances, disposal and storage of wastes and radioactive substances. \n\n(d) Emergencies and other exceptional circumstances. Not every Departmental activity will be considered a major Federal action for the purposes of these regulations. Several limited classes of action which might ordinarily be subject to these regulations will not be considered major Federal actions requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Among them are the following: \n\n(1) Actions taken in emergency circumstances and disaster and emergency relief activities as defined in § 1506.11 of the CEQ Regulations (in such circumstances the responsible action officer should consult with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  which shall consult with the Council on Environmental Quality about appropriate alternative arrangements); \n\n(2) Mandatory actions required under any treaty or international agreement to which the United States Government is a party, or required by the decisions of international organizations or authorities in which the United States is a member or participant except when the United States has substantial discretion over implementation of such requirements; \n\n(3) Payment of contributions, either assessed or voluntary, to any international organization of which the United States is a member pursuant to the obligation of a treaty or other international agreement or which is not for the purpose of carrying out a specifically identifiable action which would affect the environment; and \n\n(4) Support for or acquiescence in (by affirmative vote or agreement to consensus) an activity or expenditure of funds by an international organization where the United States has no unilateral right to control such expenditures. \n\n[45 FR 59554, Sept. 10, 1980, as amended at 85 FR 32296, May 29, 2020]",

          "content": "§ 161.8   General description of the Department's NEPA process.\nIn reviewing proposed actions for potential environmental effects in the United States responsible action officers will follow the procedural steps set forth below. These steps are developed in conjunction with the procedural steps required by the CEQ Regulations which are referenced in the following sections. \n\n(a) Preliminary environmental evaluations. Early in the process of considering any possible action the responsible action officer shall review the action to determine if it may cause potential significant environmental effects on the environment of the United States. A proposed action shall be reviewed initially to determine into which of the following three basic categories of action it falls: \n\n(1) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements; \n\n(2) Actions categorically excluded from environmental impact statements; or \n\n(3) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments. If the responsible action officer concludes that the proposed action is a major action potentially having significant effects in the United States he should, in cooperation with other appropriate Departmental officials, carry out the steps described in these regulations. If during his review of the location of potential environmental effects or following preparation of an environmental assessment it is determined that the action could affect the environment of the global commons or a foreign nation the officer is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Department's procedures for implementing Executive Order No. 12114 on Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions (Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 2).\n\n(b) Environmental Assessment. An environmental assessment is a concise document which analyzes potential environmental effects to determine if an environmental impact statement is required (CEQ Regulations §§ 1501.3 and 1508.9). If the action does not fall into either the category of those actions normally requiring an environmental impact statement or that of actions categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement, then the responsible action officer, in cooperation with other Departmental officials, shall prepare an environmental assessment to determine whether it is necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement or a “Finding of no significant impact”. If the action normally requires an environmental impact statement, there is ordinarily no need for the preparation of an environmental assessment and the environmental impact statement process should be initiated without preparing such an assessment. If the action is categorically excluded, no further environmental review is needed. If an environmental assessment is prepared it may also be used to evaluate whether the proposed action may have effects outside the United States.\n\n(c) Finding of no significant impact. If the environmental assessment indicates that the environmental effects of the action in the United States are not significant, then the responsible action officer shall make a “Finding of no significant impact”, thereby concluding the NEPA review process (CEQ Regulations §§ 1501.4 and 1508.13).\n\n(d) Environmental impact statement. If the environmental assessment demonstrates that the environmental effects of the action with the United States may be “significant” (see § 1508.27 of the CEQ Regulations) the Department is required to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in accordance with these regulations (see also CEQ Regulations § 1501.8, part 1502 and §§ 1506.2 through 1506.7). In preparing the environmental impact statement the following steps will be carried out:\n\n(1) Notice of intent to prepare an EIS. If an impact statement is required, the Department will publish in the Federal Register a “Notice of intent” to prepare such a statement (CEQ Regulations §§ 1501.7 and 1508.22).\n\n(2) Scoping procedures. The Department will then hold a scoping meeting with interested agencies and individuals to determine the proper content (“scope”) of the statement (CEQ Regulations §§ 1501.7 and 1508.25).\n\n(3) Draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The Department will then prepare a draft EIS (DEIS) which will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and circulated to agencies and the public for comment for at least 45 days, except where the CEQ Regulations and these regulations permit the time period to be shortened (CEQ Regulations § 1501.8, part 1502, §§ 1506.2 through 1506.7, 1506.10(d) and 1506.11; 161.7(d), 161.9(n)(2)).\n\n(4) Final environmental impact statement (FEIS). In light of the comments and following any revision in the draft EIS, the Department will file with the Environmental Protection Agency and circulate to agencies and the public a final EIS at least 30 days before making a final decision on the action, except where the CEQ Regulations and these regulations permit the time period to be shortened (CEQ Regulations §§ 1506.9, 1506.10(d), 1506.11; 161.7(d), 161.9(n)(2)).\n\n(5) Record of decision. After making a decision on the action, the Department will make available a formal “Record of decision” (CEQ Regulations § 1505.2).",

          "content": "§ 161.9   Specific steps in the Department's NEPA process.\n(a) Decision whether to prepare an EIS. In deciding whether to prepare an environmental impact statement, the responsible action officer shall make an initial review in the early planning stages of a proposed action to identify and evaluate potential environmental effects of the actions and all reasonable measures which may be taken to mitigate adverse impacts. This review must be conducted in conjunction with all requests under the Department's Circular 175 procedure (11 FAM 720), with all actions involving the obligation of funds within the Department's annual or supplemental budget submissions to the Office of Management and Budget, and with other actions when a potentially significant environmental impact may result. The responsible action officer shall ensure that the principal action memoranda prepared for such actions properly reflect the environmental review in all cases. No written statement is required in the case of actions which do not raise the question of environmental impacts. The environmental evaluation document prepared shall be considered along with political, economic and other decisionmaking factors relating to the proposed action. \n\n(1) Review of the categories of actions. During the initial environmental review of the proposed action, the responsible action officer should classify the proposed Departmental action as one either normally requiring an environmental impact statement, normally not requiring such a statement, or normally requiring an environmental assessment. (See § 1504.1 of the CEQ Regulations and § 161.7 of these regulations.) \n\n(i) Actions normally requiring environmental statements. Environmental assessments are not required for actions which it is already known will require the preparation of environmental impact statements. For each major Departmental action which, in the view of the responsible action officer meets the criteria of this section, he shall, in cooperation with theOffice of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues, initiate steps to prepare an environmental impact statement. This will be accomplished by preparing a “Notice of intent” to prepare an EIS (see § 1508.22 of the CEQ Regulations). The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall arrange for publication of the notice in the Federal Register (see § 1507.3(e) of the CEQ Regulations). The responsible action officer shall then apply the procedures set forth in § 161.8 of these regulations to determine the scope of the proposed EIS, and proceed to prepare and release the environmental impact statement in accordance with CEQ and Departmental regulations. If, however, the responsible action officer believes that the proposed action, though included within or closely similar to one which normally requires the preparation of an EIS, will itself have no significant impact, he should conduct an environmental assessment in accordance with the CEQ Regulations (§ 1508.9). If the assessment demonstrates that there will be no significant impact, he should prepare a “Finding of no significant impact” and provide for public review a notice of this finding in accordance with §§ 1501.4(e) and 1506.6 of the CEQ Regulations. \n\n(ii) Actions categorically excluded. Separate detailed documentation is not normally required for actions which are categorically excluded and which are therefore exempt from the requirement of preparations of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. However, the responsible action officer shall note in the action memorandum concerning the action that the proposed action has been reviewed under the Department's environmental procedures and determined to be categorically excluded. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall periodically review actions in the classes categorically excluded under these regulations to determine if the original decision to categorically exclude the class remains valid. If such a review determines that a proposed action may have a significant impact on the human environment the necessary revision in the categorical exclusion shall be made and an environmental assessment shall be prepared to determine the need for the preparation of an environmental impact statement. \n\n(iii) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments. For each action meeting the criteria of this section the responsible action officer shall prepare an environmental assessment (see §§ 1501.3 and 1508.9 of the CEQ Regulations) and, on the basis of that assessment, determine if an EIS is required. If the determination is that no environmental impact statement is required, the responsible action officer shall, in coordination with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues, prepare a “Finding of no significant impact” (see §§ 1501.4 and 1508.13 of the CEQ Regulations). The “Finding of no significant impact” shall be made available to the public through direct distribution and publication in the Federal Register. If the determination is that an environmental impact statement is required, the official shall proceed with the “Notice of intent” to prepare an EIS and the subsequent steps in the preparation and release of an EIS in accordance with the CEQ Regulations (§§ 1501.7, 1507.3 and 1508.22) and these regulations. \n\n(2) Preparation of environmental assessments. Environmental assessments, as defined in the CEQ Regulations (§ 1508.9), should be prepared as directed in § 1501.3 of the CEQ Regulations. The environmental assessment shall be used to determine whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a “Finding of no significant impact”. The assessment shall include a brief discussion of the need for the proposed action, of alternatives and of environmental impacts and a listing of agencies and persons consulted in preparing the assessment. \n\n(3) Notice of intent to prepare an EIS. As soon as practicable after deciding to prepare an environmental impact statement and before initiating the scoping process (see § 161.9(b) of these regulations) the Department or another lead agency, if one is designated in accordance with § 1501.5 of the CEQ Regulations, shall publish in the Federal Register a “Notice of intent” to prepare an EIS in accordance with §§ 1501.7 and 1508.22 of the CEQ Regulations. The \n\n  Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  shall arrange for publishing the notice. \n\n(b) Scoping. The Department shall conduct an early and open meeting with interested agencies and the public for determining the scope of issues to be addressed in a given environmental impact statement and for identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action. The elements of the scoping process are defined in § 1501.7 of the CEQ Regulations and must include consideration of the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts discussed in § 1508.25 of the CEQ Regulations. \n\n(c) Cooperation with other agencies. Departmental officials are encouraged to cooperate with other agencies and the public throughout the conduct of the Department's NEPA process. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall ensure also that the Department reviews the draft and final impact statements submitted for review by other agencies (§ 1502.19 of the CEQ Regulations). Where appropriate and to eliminate duplication it shall arrange to prepare environmental assessments and impact statements jointly with other Federal or State agencies. Where possible it will arrange for the department to “adopt” statements prepared by other agencies (§ 1506.3 of the CEQ Regulations). It shall arrange lead and cooperating agency responsibilities for preparing environmental documents (see §§ 1501.5 and 1501.6 of CEQ Regulations). \n\n(d) Preparation of draft environmental impact statement. The responsible action officer shall be responsible for the preparation of the draft environmental impact statement in the manner described in § 1501.8, part 1502, and §§ 1506.2 through 1506.7 of the CEQ Regulations. Preliminary copies of the draft environmental impact statement and attachments shall be submitted to the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  before any formal review is conducted outside the Department. This submission shall be accompanied by a list of Federal, State, and local officials (part 1503 of the CEQ Regulations) and a list of other interested parties (§ 1506.6 of the CEQ Regulations) whose comments shall be sought. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall review the draft and obtain additional comments from other appropriate Departmental bureaus and offices. \n\n(e) Review of and comment on draft EIS. For external review, the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  shall transmit five copies of the revised draft statement to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Federal Activities. EPA will publish a notice of the statement's availability the following week in the Federal Register. Upon transmission of the draft statement to EPA, the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall also seek the views of appropriate agencies and individuals in accordance with part 1503 and §§ 1506.6 and 1506.9 of the CEQ Regulations. It shall specify that replies are required at a stated date not earlier than 45 days from the date of NEPA publication of the draft statement availability. Any views submitted during the comment period shall be provided to the responsible action officer in the Department for consideration in preparing the final statement. To the fullest extent possible, requirements for review and consultation with other agencies on environmental matters established by statutes other than NEPA, such as the review and consultation requirements of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, should be met before or through this review process (see § 161.11 of these regulations). In addition, the draft EIS shall list all environmentally-related federal permits, licenses or other approvals required to implement the proposal as specified in § 1502.25(b) of the CEQ Regulations. \n\n(f) Public involvement. (1) Departmental officials will make diligent efforts to involve the public in implementing these regulations as provided in §§ 1501.4(e), 1503.1(a)(e) and 1506.6 of the CEQ Regulations. \n\n(2) Interested persons can obtain information on the Department's environmental impact statements and other aspects of the Department's NEPA process by contacting the Director, Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues , Room 7820, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520 (tel. 202/632-9266). Information pertaining to the NEPA process may be sent to the above address. Federal Register notices concerning the Department's environmental documents shall specify where such information relevant to the documents in question may be obtained.\n\n(3) The responsible action officer shall identify those persons, community organizations, environmental interest groups, international organizations or other bodies which may have an interest in or be affected by the proposed Departmental action and who should therefore be involved in the NEPA process. With the assistance of the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues, the responsible action shall transmit a list of such persons, groups and organizations to the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues at the same time he submits:\n\n(i) A recommendation regarding a “Finding of no significant impact”;\n\n(ii) A “Notice of intent to prepare an EIS”;\n\n(iii) A recommendation on possible public hearings (see § 1506.6(c) of CEQ Regulations);\n\n(iv) A draft EIS, or\n\n(v) A final EIS.\n\n(4) The responsible action officer shall consult with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues and make recommendations regarding the need for public hearings. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall, as necessary, review such recommendations with the Office of the Legal Adviser.\n\n(g) Preparation of final environmental impact statement. (1) After conclusion of the review process with other Federal, State and local agencies and the public, the responsible action officer shall consider suggestions received and revise the draft environmental impact statement as appropriate in accordance with part 1502 and § 1501.8 and §§ 1506.2 through 1506.7 of the CEQ Regulations.\n\n(2) Five copies of the preliminary final environmental impact statement, with attached copies of the comments received and suggested responses, shall be provided to the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues \n\nwill, as appropriate, obtain additional comments from any other appropriate Departmental bureau or offices and notify the responsible action officer of any further changes required and the number of final statements to be transmitted. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues shall submit five copies of the final statement to the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Review. Copies shall also be sent to all parties who commented and to other interested parties in accordance with § 1506.9 of the CEQ Regulations.\n\n(3) Each draft and final statement, the supporting documentation, and the “Record of decision” (see § 161.9(h) of these regulations) shall be available for public review and copying at the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  (OES/ENH), Room 7820, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520 (tel. 202/632-9267).\n\n(h) Record of the decision. At the time of the decision on the proposed action, the responsible Departmental official shall consult with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues  and prepare a concise “Record of decision” (see § 1505.2 of the CEQ Regulations).\n\n(i) Timing of EIS preparation and action decision. Preparation of an environmental impact statement shall be initiated as soon as the responsible action officer, in consultation with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues and the Office of the Legal Adviser, has determined that the statement shall be prepared. Except where permitted by the CEQ Regulations (§§ 1506.10(d), 1506.11) and these regulations (§§ 161.7(d), 161.9(n)(2)), no decision on the proposed action shall be made by the Department until the later of the following dates:\n\n(1) Ninety (90) days after publication by EPA of a notice of availability of a Departmental draft EIS.\n\n(2) Thirty (30) days after publication by EPA of a notice of availability of a departmental final EIS. \n\n(j) Implementing and monitoring the decision. Section 1505.3 of the CEQ Regulations establishes the procedures to be followed by the Department in monitoring to assure that any mitigation measures or other commitments associated with the decision and its implementation are carried out. The Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues will maintain general oversight and cooperate with bureau officers in such monitoring.\n\n(k) Supplemental environmental impact statements. Departmental officials shall supplement a draft EIS whenever an alternative which is substantially different from those discussed in the draft is under consideration or when the draft is otherwise out of date. A final EIS shall be supplemented when a substantial change is made in the proposed action or when significant new information on the environmental impacts comes to light. A supplemental EIS should be prepared, circulated and approved in accordance with the provisions of § 1502.9 of the CEQ Regulations. No supplemental EIS need be prepared when the final decision on the action in question has already been made. If there are reasons not to prepare a supplemental EIS when one ordinarily would be called for, the responsible action officer should consult with the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues , which shall consult with the Council on Environmental Quality on the matter. \n\n(l) Programmatic and generic environmental impact statements. (1) Before preparing an environmental document under these regulations the responsible action officer should determine if there exists a generic or programmatic environmental document analyzing actions, effects or issues similar to those involved in the proposed action. A generic environmental document reviews the environmental effects that are generic or common to a class of Departmental actions which may not be specific to any single country or area. Where such a document is prepared it could be applied to a number of similar specific country applications. If a generic document exists and if it deals with relevant similarities in the action, such as common timing, environmental impacts, alternatives, methods of implementation or subject matter it will not be necessary to prepare further environmental documentation. \n\n(2) A programmatic environmental document shall focus its analysis on the environmental aspects of an entire program rather than on the specific elements of the program. If a programmatic environmental document has already been prepared the responsible action officer should determine whether it adequately deals with the environmental effects of the particular action under review. If the programmatic document adequately reviews the environmental impacts of the action under consideration, then additional environmental documentation is not required under these regulations. In preparing environmental documents on specific actions, Departmental officers shall consider the advisability of modifying or expanding the documents so they may serve as generic or programmatic documents for a broader range of actions. \n\n(m) Amendments. Amendments to these regulations may be made by the Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs in consultation with other Departmental bureaus and the Office of the Legal Adviser. Such amendments will be published in the Federal Register after consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, in accordance with § 1507.3 of the CEQ Regulations, and public review and comment. \n\n(n) Modifications. The Department's procedures for preparing environmental documents may be modified to accommodate the following circumstances: \n\n(1) Classified material. Most Departmental environmental documents will not normally contain classified or administratively controlled material (see § 1507.3(c) of the CEQ Regulations); in some cases, however, an environmental document must include such material to evaluate adequately environmental effects. In such cases Departmental environmental documents, or portions thereof, may be classified. Such material should, if possible, be confined to a classified annex of the environmental document. Approval for classification must be granted with the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs and the Office of the Legal Adviser, and the assistant secretary of the bureau with the action responsibility for the proposed action. In these cases, Departmental environmental documents or portions thereof may be classified in accordance with the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12065, dated December 1, 1978. Handling and disclosure of classified or administratively controlled material shall be governed by 22 CFR part 9. The portions of an environmental document which are not classified or administratively controlled will be made available to persons outside the Department, as provided in 22 CFR part 9. Classification does not preclude the obligation to ensure that environmental documents are reviewed by competent scientific and technical experts. Appropriate arrangements will be made through the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Issues or Federal agency review of classified or administratively controlled environmental documents. \n\n(2) Time periods for environmental review. When necessary to comply with other specific statutory requirements or for compelling reasons of national policy the Department may, by agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, modify time periods specified by the CEQ Regulations for preparing environmental documents in accordance with § 1506.10 of the CEQ Regulations. See also provisions for emergency circumstances contained in § 1506.11 of the CEQ Regulations and § 161.7(d) of these regulations.",

PA requests must be made in writing and signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. See § 171.22(a). PA requests may be made to A/GIS/IPS by email to foiarequest@state.gov, by fax to (202) 485-1669, or by mail. FOIA and PA requests made by mail should be addressed to: Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS), Room B-266, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520.\n\n(2) Requests for passport records covered under PA System of Records Notice STATE-26 (available at www.state.gov/system-of-records-notices-privacy-office/) must be made in writing, and may be submitted directly to the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate (PPT) of the Bureau of Consular Affairs by mailing the request to U.S. Department of State, Office of Law Enforcement Liaison, FOIA Officer, 44132 Mercure Circle, P.O. Box 1227, Sterling, VA 20166-1227. Requests for passport records and information that do not need to be certified may also be emailed to PPT-Public-FOIARequests@state.gov.\n\n(3) Requests for records of the OIG must be made in writing, and may be submitted via email to foia@stateoig.gov, by fax to 703-284-1866, or by mail addressed to FOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of State, 1700 N Moore Street, Suite 1400, Arlington, VA 22209. Submission by email is preferred. Guidance and contact information are available on the OIG's website at www.stateoig.gov/foiarequest.\n\n(4) The Office of Information Programs and Services, the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate, and the OIG are the only Department components authorized to accept FOIA and PA requests submitted to the Department.\n\n(5) The requester should provide the specific citation to the authority under which he or she is requesting information (e.g., the FOIA, the PA, or Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) under the current Executive Order on classification). This will facilitate the processing of the request. When individual U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents request access to records about themselves, the Department processes responsive records maintained in Privacy Act systems of records under both the FOIA and the PA to provide requesters with the greatest degree of access to the records. Information in such records will be withheld only if it is exempt from access under both laws; if the information is exempt under only one of the laws, it will be released. Responsive records that are not maintained in a Privacy Act system of records are processed only under the FOIA.\n\n(6) A requester who requests records about himself or herself, including passport records, must comply with the verification of identity requirements as set forth in § 171.22 of Subpart C (the Privacy Act Provisions) of this part in order for the request to be processed under the PA.\n\n(7) Where a request for records pertains to a third party or to a requester's own records outside of a request under the Privacy Act, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized authorization signed by the person whose records are requested, or by submitting a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by the person whose records are requested, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the third party is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary).\n\n(8) The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, section 222(f) (8 U.S.C. 1202(f)), provides that the records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States must be considered confidential and shall be used only for certain enumerated purposes, including the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States. As a result, information subject to release in response to a request for visa records about an individual may be limited. Requests for visa records should include the following information for the applicant and, if applicable, the petitioner: full name, as well as any aliases used; current address; email; and date and place of birth (including city, state, and country). Additional information describing the records sought will assist the Department in properly identifying the responsive records and in processing the request. Attorneys or other legal representatives requesting visa information on behalf of a visa applicant should submit a statement with the request signed by the applicant (and the petitioner if the records sought pertain to a petition) authorizing release of the requested visa information to the representative. Alternatively, requesters may submit a DS-4240-R to certify their identity or a DS-4240-C to provide authorization by the applicant (and the petitioner if the records sought pertain to a petition) to release the requested information to the legal representative. Forms created by other Federal agencies will not be accepted. Other information found in the visa file, such as information submitted as part of the visa application and information not falling within section 222(f) or another FOIA exemption, may be provided to the requester.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Although no particular format is required, a request must reasonably describe the Department record(s) that the requester seeks. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist the Department in identifying the requested record(s), such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter, case number, file designation reference number, or timeframe. If after receiving a request the Department determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Department will inform the requester that the request is insufficient and shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed. Any records provided in response to a request will be provided in the form or format requested if a releasable form of the records is readily reproducible in that form or format. Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the Department in communicating with them and providing released records.\n\n(c) Privacy Act versus FOIA. While the Department makes every effort to provide the greatest possible access to all requested records regardless of the statute(s) under which the information is requested, the following guidance is provided for the benefit of requesters:\n\n\n\n(1) The Freedom of Information Act applies to requests for records concerning the general activities of government and of the Department in particular (see subpart B of this part).\n\n(2) The Privacy Act applies to requests from U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents for records about them that are maintained by the Department in a system of records retrievable by the individual's name or personal identifier (see subpart C of this part).",

          "content": "§ 171.11   Processing requests.\n(a) In general. (1) The Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for initial action on all FOIA requests for Department records, with two exceptions: requests seeking records under the purview of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which receives and processes requests for OIG records (see § 171.4 (a)(3)); and requests seeking records under the purview of the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate of the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), which receives and processes requests for certain consular records (see § 171.4 (a)(2)).\n\n(2) For requests for which A/GIS/IPS is responsible for initial action, A/GIS/IPS will issue all initial decisions on whether a request is valid (or has subsequently been perfected) and whether to grant or deny requests for a fee waiver or for expedited processing.\n\n(3) After A/GIS/IPS takes initial action, all requests for records coming under the jurisdiction of the following components are processed by those components, although A/GIS/IPS may provide review and coordination support to these components in some situations: the Directorates for Visa Services, Passport Services, and Overseas Citizens Services, in the Bureau of Consular Affairs; the Bureau of Diplomatic Security; the Bureau of Global Talent Management; and the Bureau of Medical Services. Additionally, the Foreign Service Grievance Board (FSGB), as an independent body, processes all FOIA requests seeking access to its records and responds directly to requesters.\n\n(b) Receipt of request. The Department is in receipt of a request when the request is received by A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT, depending on which office is the proper recipient. At that time, the Department must send an acknowledgement letter to the requester that identifies the date of receipt of the request in the proper office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT), and the case tracking number. When one of these offices determines that a request was misdirected within the Department, that office must promptly route the request to the proper office(s) within the Department.\n\n(c) Cut-off date and exclusions. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Department ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date of initiation of the search for responsive records, unless the requester has specified an earlier cut-off date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.\n\n(d) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing records located in response to a request, the component processing the request will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the component must proceed in one of the following ways:\n\n(1) Consultation. When records originated with the Department, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the component processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.\n\n(2) Referral. (i) When the component processing the request believes that a different Department component or other Federal Government agency is better able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component processing the request typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that component or agency, as long as the referral is to an entity subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the better position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n\n\n\n(ii) Whenever the component processing the request refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another entity, the component must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the entity to which the record was referred, including that entity's FOIA contact information.\n\n(3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement component responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harm. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component that received the request should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the whether the record may be disclosed. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will be conveyed to the requester by the component that originally received the request.\n\n(e) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by the Department will be handled according to the date that the perfected FOIA request was received by the first agency.\n\n(f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The Department may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate, reduce, or streamline the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.",

          "content": "§ 171.12   Timing of responses to requests.\n(a) In general. The Department ordinarily will respond to requests in the order received. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 171.11 (b), the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the proper office that is designated to receive requests (A/GIS/IPS, OIG or PPT), but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any of these three offices.\n\n(b) Multi-track processing. The Department has a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards that are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. An intake office (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) may also designate additional processing tracks that, for example, distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. Among the factors that may also be considered are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. The Department must advise requesters of the track in which their request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.\n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of unusual circumstances, as defined in the FOIA, and the Department extends the time limit on that basis, the Department must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Department must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or a modified request. The Department must make available its designated FOIA contact and FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose (see foia.state.gov/contact/). In the written notice to the requester, the Department must also alert the requester to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services.\n\n(d) Expedited processing. (1) Requests shall receive expedited processing when a requester demonstrates that a compelling need for the information exists. A compelling need is deemed to exist when the requester can demonstrate one of the following:\n\n(i) Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, there exists an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or\n\n\n\n(iii) Failure to release the information would impair substantial due process rights or harm substantial humanitarian interests.\n\n(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. Requests for expedited processing must be submitted to the office responsible for receiving the FOIA request (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request must be submitted to A/GIS/IPS, or OIG in the case of appeals of OIG decisions (see § 171.15). A Department FOIA office that receives a misdirected request for expedited processing must forward it promptly to the correct office responsible for receiving requests (A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT) for its determination. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing commences on the date that the correct office receives the request, provided that the Department will be considered to have received the request for expedited processing no more than 10 working days after the request for expedited processing is received by A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT.\n\n(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Department may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(4) A notice of the determination whether to grant expedited processing must be provided to the requester within 10 calendar days of the date of the receipt of the request for expedited processing in the appropriate office (whether A/GIS/IPS, OIG, or PPT). If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. A denial of a request for expedited processing may be appealed within 90 calendar days of the date of the Department's letter denying the request. A decision in writing on the appeal will be issued within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the appeal.",

The Department will, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email or a web portal.\n\n(b) Acknowledgment of requests. The Department must acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Department must include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests. The Department may in its discretion divide a multi-part request into multiple requests in order to facilitate processing.\n\n(c) Estimated dates of completion and interim responses. Upon request, the Department will provide an estimated date by which the Department expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the agency may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.\n\n(d) Grants of requests. Once the Department makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it must notify the requester in writing. The Department also must inform the requester of any fees charged under § 171.16 and must disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Department must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.\n\n(e) Adverse determinations of requests. If the Department makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(f) Content of denial. The denial must be signed by the head of the component processing the request, or designee, and must include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemptions applied in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 171.15 and a description of the requirements set forth therein; and\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Department's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n(g) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part must be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(h) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that the Department identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), A/GIS/IPS or OIG must confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) Any time the Department invokes an exclusion, it must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.",

          "content": "§ 171.14   Confidential commercial information.\n(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:\n\nConfidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by the Department from a submitter that may be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).\n\nSubmitter means any person or entity from which the Department obtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships; state, local, and tribal governments; foreign governments; NGOs; and educational institutions. This term does not include another Federal Government entity.\n\n(b) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good-faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings at the time of submission any portions of its submission that it considers exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. These designations expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.\n\n(c) Notice to submitters. (1) The Department must provide a submitter with prompt written notice whenever records containing its confidential commercial information are requested under the FOIA if the agency determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n\n\n(i) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) The Department has reason to believe that the requested information may be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.\n\n(2) The notice must either describe the confidential commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or record portions containing the information.\n\n(d) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:\n\n(1) The Department determines that the information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and, therefore, will not be disclosed;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, the Department must give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The Department must allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section and must specify that time period in the notice. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Department a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in it, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The Department is not required to consider any information received after any disclosure decision. Information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(f) Notice of intent to disclose. The Department will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential commercial information. Whenever the Department decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, it must give the submitter written notice, which must include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the Department intends to release them; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice.\n\n(g) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Department must promptly notify the submitter.\n\n(h) Notice to requester. The Department must notify the requester whenever it provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of the requested information.",

          "content": "§ 171.15   Administrative appeals.\n(a) Requirements for making an appeal. (1) Requesters may appeal any adverse determinations made on their FOIA request by the Department. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 171.13(e). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the adverse determination. The appeal must clearly identify the component's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(2) To appeal any adverse determinations made by A/GIS/IPS or a component other than OIG, requesters must submit an administrative appeal to the A/GIS/IPS FOIA Appeals Office using any of the following methods: by mail to the Appeals Officer, Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS), Room B-266, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520; by fax to (202) 485-1718; or by email to FOIAAppeals@state.gov.\n\n(3) To appeal any adverse determinations made by OIG, requesters must submit an administrative appeal to OIG via email to foia@stateoig.gov, by fax to 703-284-1866, or by mail addressed to the FOIA Officer, Officer of General Counsel, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of State, 1700 N Moore Street, Suite 1400, Arlington, VA 22209. Contact information for OIG is available on OIG's FOIA website at www.stateoig.gov/foiaappeals. For those cases in which both A/GIS/IPS and OIG provided written denials to the requester, the requester may administratively appeal to both A/GIS/IPS and OIG and each office will handle its respective portion of the appeal.\n\n(4) To appeal any adverse determinations made by the FSGB, requesters must submit an administrative appeal to A/GIS/IPS using the methods listed above in paragraph (2). A/GIS/IPS will assign a tracking number to the appeal and forward it to the FSGB, which is an independent body, for adjudication.\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The A/GIS/IPS Director or designee will act on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Administration on all appeals of A/GIS/IPS FOIA determinations under this section. Likewise, the General Counsel of OIG or his/her designee will act on behalf of the Inspector General on all appeals of OIG FOIA determinations under this section.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(c) Decisions on appeals. The Department must provide its decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Department's determination in whole or in part must include a brief statement of the reason for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must inform the requester that the decision represents the final decision of the Department; must advise the requester of the statutory right to file a lawsuit; and must inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified in writing. The appropriate component will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.\n\n(d) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n(e) When appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of the Department's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.",

          "section_name": "§ 171.16   Fees to be charged.",
          "content": "§ 171.16   Fees to be charged.\n(a) In general. The Department will charge fees for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters: commercial use requesters, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\nCommercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Department's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Department will notify requesters of their placement in this category.\n\nDirect costs are those expenses the Department incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing records in response to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. The term does not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and of heating or lighting of a facility.\n\nDuplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n\n\nEducational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. The Department may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research. The Department will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\nNon-commercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in  this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. Noncommercial scientific institution requesters will not be charged for search and review time, and the first 100 pages of the duplication will be provided free of charge. The Department will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\nRepresentative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. Freelance journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Department shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. A representative of the news media will not be charged for search and review time, and the first 100 pages of the duplication will be provided free of charge. The Department will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\nReview is the examination of a record located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 171.14 but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\nSearch is the process of looking for, identifying, and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the Department will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (j) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Department should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (j) of this section. The Department may properly charge for time spent searching even if responsive records are not located, or if records are determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, the fees shall be as stated at the following website: foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx\n\n(section VII, “Fees”) and www.stateoig.gov/foiafees for OIG requested records.\n\n(iii) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by the Department at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Review. The Department will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Department's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(3) Duplication. The Department will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Department must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the Department in the form or format requested. The Department charges the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. Duplication fees are as stated at the following website: foia.state.gov/Request/Guide.aspx (section VII, “Fees”).\n\n(d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) The Department will not charge search fees for requests by educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.\n\n(2) If the Department fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.\n\n(i) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit is excused for an additional 10 days.\n\n(ii) If the Department has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Department may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The Department must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, and the Department must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Department may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.\n\n(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Department must provide without charge:\n\n(i) the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) the first two hours of search.\n\n(4) When, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, the total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less, no fee will be charged.\n\n(5) Apart from the stated provisions regarding waiver or reduction of fees, see paragraph (j) of this section, the Department may in its sole discretion decide to not assess fees or to reduce them if it is in the best interests of the government not to do so.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When the Department determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Department must notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Department will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for commercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlement of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) In cases in which the Department has notified the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates an amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Department is not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Department estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Department will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Department will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n\n\n(4) The Department must make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(g) Charging interest. The Department may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date the bill was sent to the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the Department. The fact that a fee has been received by the Department within the thirty-day grace period, even if not processed, shall stay the accrual of interest. The Department must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(h) Aggregating requests. When the Department reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Department may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Department may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.\n\n(i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the Department cannot require a requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to the requester) is not advance payment.\n\n(2) When the Department estimates or determines that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Department may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay FOIA fees to any component within 30 calendar days of the date of its billing, the Department may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Department begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any appeal from that requester. Where the Department has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity. Additionally, if a requester has failed to pay FOIA fees to another U.S. Government agency in a FOIA case, the Department may require proof that such fee has been paid before processing a new or pending request from that requester.\n\n(4) In cases in which the Department requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Department's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n\n(j) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) The Department must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:\n\n(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. The Department will presume that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Department will consider the following factors:\n\n(A) The Department must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Department must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirement of paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Department ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction must be granted for those records.\n\n(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Department and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.\n\n[88 FR 71740, Oct. 18, 2023; 88 FR 73755, Oct. 27, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 171.22   Request for access to records.\n(a) In general. Requests for access to records under the PA must be made in writing and sent to the Office of Information Programs and Services, the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, or the Office of Inspector General at the addresses given in § 171.4. The Director of the Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for acting on all PA requests for Department records except for requests received directly by the Office of Inspector General, which processes its own requests for information, and the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which receives directly and processes its own PA requests for information as described in PA System of Record Notice STATE-26. All processing of PA requests coming under the jurisdiction of the Directorates for Visa Services and Overseas Citizens Services in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Bureau of Global Talent Management, the Bureau of Medical Services, and the Foreign Service Grievance Board (FSGB) are handled by those bureaus or offices.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requests for access should describe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit identification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include the individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and any other names used, current complete mailing address, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). Helpful information includes the approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that give the individual reason to believe that the Department maintains a record under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if known, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In certain instances, it may be necessary for the Department to request additional information from the requester, either to ensure a full search, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to the individual.\n\n(c) Verification of personal identity. The Department will require reasonable identification of individuals requesting records about themselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are only accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full name, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien status, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. If the requester seeks records under another name the requester has used, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has also used the other name must be included. Requesters seeking access to copies of the Passport Services' passport records must meet the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(d) Special requirements for passport records. Given the sensitive nature of passport records and their use, requesters seeking access to copies of passport records from Passport Services under the PA must submit a letter that is either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, which includes the full name at birth and any subsequent name changes of the individual whose records are being requested (if submitting the request on behalf of a minor, provide the representative's full name as well); the date and place of birth of the individual whose records are being requested; the requester's current mailing address; and, if available, daytime telephone number and email address; the date or estimated date the passport(s) was issued; the passport number of the person whose records are being sought, if known; and any other information that will help to locate the records. The requester must also include a clear copy of both sides of the requester's valid government-issued photo identification, e.g., a driver's license.\n\n(e) Authorized third party access. The Department shall process all properly authorized third party requests, as described in this section, under the PA. In the absence of proper authorization from the individual to whom the records pertain, the Department will process third party requests under the FOIA. The Department's forms DS-4240-R and DS-4240-C, respectively, may be used to certify identity and provide third party authorization. Forms created by other Federal agencies will not be accepted.\n\n(1) Parents and guardians of minor children. Upon presentation of acceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a parent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person under the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under the PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors may request such records on their own behalf. When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor child, for access to records about that individual, a requester must establish: (1) the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth; (2) the requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section; (3) that the requester is the parent of that individual, which the requester may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing parentage, or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and (4) that the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.\n\n(2) Guardians of incompetent adults. A guardian of an individual who has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on behalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate documentation of the guardian relationship.\n\n(i) Verification of guardianship of incompetent adult. When making a request as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, a requester must establish: (1) the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth; (2) the requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section; (3) that the requester is the guardian of that individual, which the requester may prove by providing a copy of a court order establishing guardianship; and (4) that the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.\n\n(ii) Authorized representatives or designees. When an individual wishes to authorize the Department to permit a third party access to his or her records, the individual to whom the records pertain must submit, in addition to the identity verification information described in paragraph (c) (or paragraph (d) of this section if the request is for passport records), a signed statement from the individual to whom the records pertain, either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, giving the Department authorization to release records about the individual to the third party. The designated third party must submit identity verification information described in paragraph (c). Third party requesters seeking access to copies of the Passport Office's records must submit a clear copy of both sides of a valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license) in addition to the other information described above.\n\n(f) Referrals and consultations. If the Department determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another agency, it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency for direct response to the requester. If the Department determines that Department records retrieved as responsive to the request are of interest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before responding to the request. The Department may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.\n\n(g) Records relating to civil actions. Nothing in this subpart entitles an individual to access any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.\n\n(h) Time limits. The Department will acknowledge the request promptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible thereafter.",

In utilizing these exemptions, the Department is exempting only those portions of systems that are necessary for the proper functioning of the Department and that are consistent with the PA. Where compliance would not interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by the Department or the OIG, in the sole discretion of the Department or the OIG, as appropriate. Records exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by the originator of the record remain exempt if subsequently incorporated into any Department system of records, provided the reason for the exemption remains valid and necessary.\n\n(a) General exemptions.

          "content": "§ 191.12   Description of benefits.\nThe following material is included to assist persons affected, by providing a brief description of some of the provisions of the Civil Relief Act. Note that not all of the sections applicable to hostages have been included here. References to sections herein are references to the Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended, followed by references in parentheses to the same section in the United States Code.\n\n(a) Guarantors, endorsers. Section 103 (50 U.S.C. App. 513) provides that whenever a hostage is granted relief from the enforcement of an obligation, a court, in its discretion, may grant the same relief to guarantors and endorsers of the obligation. Amendments extend relief to accommodation makers and others primarily or secondarily liable on an obligation, and to sureties on a criminal bail bond. They provide, on certain conditions, that the benefits of the section with reference to persons primarily or secondarily liable on an obligation may be waived in writing.\n\n(b) Written agreements. Section 107 (50 U.S.C. App. 517) provides that nothing contained in the Act shall prevent hostages from making certain arrangements with respect to their contracts and obligations, but requires that such arrangements be in writing.\n\n(c) Protection in court. Section 200 (50 U.S.C. App. 520) provides that if a hostage is made defendant in a court action and is unable to appear in court, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the hostage and protect the hostage's interests. Further, if a judgment is rendered against the hostage, an opportunity to reopen the case and present a defense, if meritorious, may be permitted within 90 days after release.\n\n(d) Court postponement. Section 201 (50 U.S.C. App. 521) authorizes a court to postpone any court proceedings if a hostage is a party thereto and is unable to participate by reason of being a captive.\n\n(e) Relief against penalties. Section 202 (50 U.S.C. App. 522) provides for relief against fines or penalties when a court proceeding involving a hostage is postponed, or when the fine or penalties are incurred for failure to perform any obligation. In the latter case, relief depends upon whether the hostage's ability to pay or perform is materially affected by being held captive.\n\n(f) Postponement of action. Section 203 (50 U.S.C. App. 523) authorizes a court to postpone or vacate the execution of any judgment, attachment or garnishment.\n\n(g) Period of postponement. Section 204 (50 U.S.C. App. 524) authorizes a court to postpone proceedings for the period of captivity, and for 3 months thereafter, or any part thereof.\n\n(h) Extended time limits. Section 205 (50 U.S.C. App. 525) excludes the period of captivity from computing time under existing or future statutes of limitation. Amendments extend relief to include actions before administrative agencies, and provide that the period of captivity shall not be included in the period for redemption of real property sold to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment. Section 207 excludes application of section 205 to any period of limitation prescribed by or under the internal revenue laws of the United States.\n\n(i) Interest rates. Section 206 (50 U.S.C. App. 526) provides that interest on the obligations of hostages shall not exceed a specified per centum per annum, unless the court determines that ability to pay greater interest is not affected by being held captive.\n\n(j) Misuse of benefits. Section 600 (50 U.S.C. App. 580) provides against transfers made with intent to delay the just enforcement of a civil right by taking advantage of the Act.\n\n(k) Further relief. Section 700 (50 U.S.C. App. 590) provides that a person, during a period of captivity or 6 months thereafter, may apply to a court for relief with respect to obligations incurred prior to captivity, or any tax or assessment whether falling due prior to or during the period of captivity. The court may, on certain conditions, stay the enforcement of such obligations.\n\n(l) Stay of eviction. Section 300 (50 U.S.C. App. 530) provides that a hostage's dependents shall not be evicted from their dwelling if the rental is $150 or less per month, except upon leave of a court. If it is proved that inability to pay rent is a result of being in captivity, the court is authorized to stay eviction proceedings for not longer than 3 months. An amendment extends relief to owners of the premises with respect to payments on mortgage and taxes.\n\n(m) Contract and mortgage obligations. As provided by sections 301 and 302 of the Act (50 U.S.C. App. 531 and 532), as amended, contracts for the purchase of real and personal property, which originated prior to the period of captivity, may not be rescinded, terminated, or foreclosed, or the property repossessed, except as provided in section 107 (50 U.S.C. App. 517), unless by an order of a court. The mentioned sections give the court wide discretionary powers to make such disposition of the particular case as may be equitable in order to conserve the interests of both the hostage and the creditor. The cited sections further provide that the court may stay the proceedings for the period of captivity and 3 months thereafter, if in its opinion the ability of the hostage to perform the obligation is materially affected by reason of captivity. Section 303 (50 U.S.C. App. 533) provides that the court may appoint appraisers and, based upon their report, order such sum as may be just, if any, paid to hostages or their dependents, as a condition to foreclosing a mortgage, resuming possession of property, and rescinding or terminating a contract.\n\n(n) Termination of a lease. Section 304 (50 U.S.C. App. 534) provides, in general, that a lease covering premises occupied for dwelling, business, or agricultural purpose, executed by persons who subsequently become hostages, may be terminated by a notice in writing given to the lessor, subject to such action as may be taken by a court on application of the lessor. Termination of a lease providing for monthly payment of rent shall not be effective until 30 days after the first date on which the next rental payment is due, and, in the case of other leases, on the last day of the month following the month when the notice is served.\n\n(o) Assignment of life insurance policy. Section 305 (50 U.S.C. App. 535) provides that the assignee of a life insurance policy assigned as security, other than the insurer in connection with a policy loan, except upon certain conditions, shall not exercise any right with respect to the assignment during the period of captivity of the insured and one year thereafter, unless upon order of a court.\n\n(p) Storage lien. Section 305 (50 U.S.C. App. 535) provides that a lien for storage of personal property may not be foreclosed except upon court order. The court may stay proceedings or make other just disposition.\n\n(q) Extension of benefits to dependents. Section 306 (50 U.S.C. App. 536) extends the benefits to section 300 through 305 to dependents of a hostage. \n\n(r) Real and personal property taxes. Section 500 (50 U.S.C. App. 560) forbids sale of property, except upon court leave, to enforce collection of taxes or assessments (other than taxes on income) on personal property or real property owned and occupied by the hostage or dependents thereof at the commencement of captivity and still occupied by the hostage's dependents or employees. The court may stay proceedings for a period not more than 6 months after termination of captivity. When by law such property may be sold to enforce collection, the hostage will have the right to redeem it within 6 months after termination of captivity. Unpaid taxes or assessments bear interest at 6 percent.\n\n(s) Income taxes. Section 513 provides for deferment of payment of income taxes. However, section 204 of the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 provides for deferment and certain other relief, and should be referred to in order to determine statutory tax benefits in addition to those in section 513 of the Civil Relief Act.\n\n(t) Certification of hostage. Section 601 provides that a certificate signed by the agency head shall be prima facie evidence that the person named has been a hostage during the period specified in the certification.\n\n(u) Interlocutory orders. Section 602 (50 U.S.C. App. 582) provides that a court may revoke an interlocutory order it has issued pursuant to any provision of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940.\n\n(v) Power of attorney. Section 701 (50 U.S.C. App. 591) provides that certain powers of attorney executed by a hostage which expire by their terms after the person was captured shall be automatically extended for the period of captivity. Exceptions are made with respect to powers of attorney which by their terms clearly indicate they are to expire on the date specified irrespective of hostage status. (Section 701 applies to American hostages notwithstanding paragraph (c) thereof which states that it applies only to powers of attorney issued during the “Vietnam era”.)",

Persons whose applications are disapproved shall be advised of the reasons for the disapproval. \n\n(b) The Veterans Administration shall provide the same level and kind of assistance, including payments (by advancement or reimbursement) for authorized expenses up to the same maximum amounts, to spouses and children of hostages, and to Principals following their release from captivity as it does to eligible spouses and children of veterans and to eligible veterans, respectively, under chapters 35 and 36 of title 38, United States Code. The Veterans Administration shall, following consultation with the Secretary of State and under procedures it has established to administer section 1724 of title 38, United States Code, discontinue assistance for any individual whose conduct or progress is unsatisfactory under standards consistent with those established pursuant to such section 1724. \n\n(c) An Advisory Board shall be established to advise on eligibility for benefits under paragraphs (c) and (d) of §§ 191.31 and 191.32. The Board shall be composed of the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration as Chairperson, the Director of the Office of Medical Services of the Department of State, the Executive Director of the regional bureau of the Department of State in whose region the relevant hostile action occurred, the Director of Personnel or other designee of the applicable employing agency, and a representative of the Veterans Administration designated by the Administrator. \n\n(d) If an application is received from a spouse or child for extended training under § 191.31(c), the Secretary of Administration shall determine with the advice of the Advisory Board whether the Principal, following release from captivity, is incapacitated by the hostage experience to the extent that (1) he or she has not returned to full-time active duty and is unlikely to be able to resume the normal duties of his or her position or career, or (2) in the event of a separation from Government service, a comparable position or career, for at least six months from the date the Principal is released from captivity. If the Secretary makes such a determination, he or she may approve, within the limits of § 191.34, an application under § 191.31(c) for up to one year of education or training. If the Principal remains incapacitated, the Secretary may approve additional training or education up to the maximum authorized under § 191.34.",

Note that not all of the sections applicable to captives have been included here. References to sections herein are references to the Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended, followed by references in parentheses to the same section in the United States Code.\n\n(a) Guarantors, endorsers. Section 103 (50 U.S.C. App 513) provides that whenever a captive is granted relief from the enforcement of an obligation, a court, in its discretion, may grant the same relief to guarantors and endorsers of the obligation. Amendments extend relief to accommodation makers and others primarily or secondarily liable on an obligation, and to sureties on a criminal bail bond. They provide, on certain conditions, that the benefits of the section with reference to persons primarily or secondarily liable on an obligation may be waived in writing.\n\n(b) Written agreements. Section 107 (50 U.S.C. App. 517) provides that nothing contained in the Act shall prevent captives from making certain arrangements with respect to their contracts and obligations, but requires that such arrangements be in writing.\n\n(c) Protection in court. Section 200 (50 U.S.C. App. 517) provides that if a captive is made a defendant in a court action and is unable to appear in court, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the captive and protect the captive's interests. Further, if a judgment is rendered against the captive, an opportunity to reopen the case and present a defense, if meritorious, may be permitted within 90-days after release.\n\n(d) Court postponement. Section 201 (50 U.S.C. App. 521) authorizes a court to postpone any court proceedings if a captive is a party thereto and is unable to participate by reason of being a captive.\n\n(e) Relief against penalties. Section 202 (50 U.S.C. App. 522) provides for relief against fines or penalties when a court proceeding involving a captive is postponed, or when the fine or penalties are incurred for failure to perform any obligation. In the latter case, relief depends upon whether the captive's ability to pay or perform is materially affected by being held captive.\n\n(f) Postponement of action. Section 203 (50 U.S.C. App. 523) authorizes a court to postpone or vacate the execution of any judgment, attachment or garnishment.\n\n(g) Period of postponement. Section 204 (50 U.S.C. App. 524) authorizes a court to postpone proceedings for the period of captivity and for 3 months thereafter, or any part thereof.\n\n(h) Extended time limits. Section 205 (50 U.S.C. App. 525) excludes the period of captivity from computing time under existing or future statutes of limitation. Amendments extend relief to include actions before administrative agencies, and provide that the period of captivity shall not be included in the period for redemption of real property sold to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment. Section 207 excludes application of section 205 to any period of limitation prescribed by or under the internal revenue laws of the United States.\n\n(i) Interest rates. Section 206 (50 U.S.C. App. 526) provides that interest on the obligations of captives shall not exceed a specified per centum per annum, unless the court determines that ability to pay greater interest is not affected by being held captive.\n\n(j) Misuse of benefits. Section 600 (50 U.S.C. App. 580) provides against transfers made with intent to delay the just enforcement of a civil right by taking advantage of the Act.\n\n(k) Further relief. Section 700 (50 U.S.C. App. 590) provides that a person, during a period of captivity or 6 months thereafter, may apply to a court for relief with respect to obligations incurred prior to captivity, or any tax or assessment whether falling due prior to or during the period of captivity. The court may, on certain conditions, stay the enforcement of such obligations.\n\n(l) Stay of eviction. Section 300 (50 U.S.C. App. 530) provides that a captive's dependents shall not be evicted from their dwelling if the rental is minimal, except upon leave of a court. If it is proved that inability to pay rent is a result of being in captivity, the court is authorized to stay eviction proceedings for not longer than 3 months. An amendment extends relief to owners of the premises with respect to payment on mortgage and taxes.\n\n(m) Contract and mortgage obligations. As provided by sections 301 and 302 of the Act (50 U.S.C. App. 531 and 532), as amended, contracts for the purchase of real and personal property, which originated prior to the period of captivity, may not be rescinded, terminated, or foreclosed, or the property repossessed, except as provided in section 107 (50 U.S.C. App. 517), unless by an order of a court. The mentioned sections give the court wide discretionary powers to make such disposition of the particular case as may be equitable in order to conserve the interests of both the captive and the creditor. The cited sections further provide that the court may stay the proceedings for the period of captivity and 3 months thereafter, if in its opinion the ability of the captive to perform the obligation is materially affected by reason of captivity. Section 303 (50 U.S.C. App. 533) provides that the court may appoint appraisers and, based upon their report, order such sum as may be just, if any, paid to captives or their dependents, as a condition to foreclosing a mortgage, resuming possession of property, and rescinding or terminating a contract.\n\n(n) Termination of a lease. Section 304 (50 U.S.C. App. 534) provides, in general, that a lease covering premises occupied for dwelling, business, or agricultural purpose, executed by persons who subsequently become captives, may be terminated by a notice in writing given to the lessor, subject to such action as may be taken by a court on application of the lessor. Termination of a lease providing for monthly payment of rent shall not be effective until 30 days after the first date on which the next rental payment is due, and, in the case of other leases, on the last day of the month following the month when the notice is served.\n\n(o) Assignment of life insurance policy. Section 305 (50 U.S.C. App. 535) provides that the assignee of a life insurance policy assigned as security, other that the insurer in connection with a policy loan, except upon certain conditions, shall not exercise any right with respect to the assignment during period of captivity of the insured and one year thereafter, unless upon order of a court.\n\n(p) Storage lien. Section 305 (50 U.S.C. App. 535) provides that a lien for storage of personal property may not be foreclosed except upon court order. The court may stay proceedings or make other just disposition.\n\n(q) Extension of benefits to dependents. Section 306 (50 U.S.C. App. 536) extends the benefits to section 300 through 305 to dependents of a captive.\n\n(r) Real and personal property taxes. Section 500 (50 U.S.C. App. 560) forbids sale of property, except upon court leave, to enforce collection of taxes or assessments (other than taxes on income) on personal property or real property owned and occupied by the captive or dependents thereof at the commencement of captivity and still occupied by the captive's dependents or employees. The court may stay proceedings for a period not more than 6 months after termination of captivity. When by law such property may be sold to enforce collection, the captive will have the right to redeem it within 6 months after termination of captivity. Unpaid taxes or assessments bear interest at 6 percent.\n\n(s) Income taxes. Section 513 provides for deferment of payment of income taxes.\n\n(t) Certification of captive. Section 601 provides that a certificate signed by the agency head shall be prima facie evidence that the person named has been a captive during the period specified in the certification.\n\n(u) Interlocutory orders. Section 602 (50 U.S.C. App. 582) provides that a court may revoke an interlocutory order it has issued pursuant to any provision of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. \n\n(v) Power of attorney. Section 701 (50 U.S.C. App. 591) provides that certain powers of attorney executed by a captive which expire by their terms after the person was captured shall be automatically extended for the period of captivity. Exceptions are made with respect to powers of attorney which by their terms clearly indicate they are to expire on the date specified irrespective of captive status. (Section 701 applies to American captives notwithstanding paragraph (c) thereof which states that it applies only to powers of attorney issued during the “Vietnam era”).",

That office will handle and process medical applications and claims using the criteria in this subpart. Persons eligible in connection with domestic situations shall make application with the Agency Head, and the Agency Head shall apply the following procedures in a similar manner in administering medical benefits in domestic situations involving the respective agency. \n\n(2) The applicant shall supply all relevant information, including insurance information, requested by the Director of the Office. An eligible person may also submit claims to the Office for payment for emergency care when there is not time to obtain prior authorization as prescribed by this paragraph. \n\n(b) The Office shall evaluate all requests for care and claims for reimbursement and determine, on behalf of the Secretary of State, whether the care in question is authorized under § 192.31 of this subpart. The Office will authorize care or payment of care, when it determines the criteria of § 192.31 are met. Authorization shall include a determination as to the necessity and reasonableness of medical or health care. \n\n(c) The Office will refer applicants eligible for benefits under other Government health programs to the Government agency administering those programs. Any portion of authorized care not provided or paid for under another Government program or private insurance will be reimbursed under this subpart, subject to a determination of the reasonableness of charges. Such determination shall be made by applying the fee schedule established by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Department of Labor, which is used in paying medical benefits for work-related injuries to employees who are fully covered by OWCP. \n\n(d) Eligible persons may obtain authorized care from any licensed facility or health care provider of their choice approved by the Office. To the extent possible, the Office will attempt to arrange for authorized care to be provided in a Government facility at no cost to the patient. \n\n(e) Authorized care provided by a private facility or health care provider will be paid or reimbursed under this subpart to the extent that the Office determines that costs do not exceed reasonable and customary charges for similar care in the locality.\n\n(f) All bills for authorized medical or health care covered by insurance shall be submitted to the patient's insurance carrier for payment prior to submission to the Office for payment of the balance authorized by this part. The Office will request the health care providers to bill the insurance carrier and the Department of State for authorized care, rather than the patient. \n\n(g) Eligible persons will be reimbursed by the Office for authorized travel to obtain an evaluation of their claim under paragraph (b) of this section and for other authorized travel to obtain medical or health care authorized by this subpart.",

Foreign service national employees whose benefit levels are below comparable benefits payable to U.S. citizens under FECA may receive benefits under this subpart so that total benefits received are comparable to the benefits payable to U.S. citizen employees under FECA.\n\n(b) Family members who do not qualify for either OWCP benefits or benefits from the organizational authority in the country of employment which provides similar coverage, and anyone eligible under § 192.1(a) who does not qualify for full benefits from OWCP, must file an application for disability benefits with the Office of Medical Services, Department of State, for a determination of eligibility under this subpart, if connected with hostile action abroad. Applications made in connection with hostile action in domestic situations will be directed to the Agency Head. Such applications for disability payments will be considered using the same criteria for determination as established by OWCP.\n\n(c) Family members who are determined to be disabled by the Office of Medical Services, or Agency Head using the OWCP criteria, are eligible to receive a lump-sum payment based on the following guidelines:\n\n(1) Permanent total disability rate. A lump-sum payment equal to two year's salary of the Principal at the time of the qualifying incident.\n\n(2) Temporary total disability rate. A lump-sum payment computed at 66\n2/3 percent of the monthly pay rate of the Principal for each month of temporary total disability, not to exceed one year's salary of the Principal.\n\n(3) Partial disability rate. A lump-sum payment authorized in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8106, equal to 66\n2/3 percent of the difference between the monthly pay at the time of the qualifying incident and the monthly wage-earning capacity of the family member after the beginning of the partial disability, not to exceed one year's salary of the Principal. For family members with no wage-earning history, a lump-sum payment equal to 66\n2/3 percent of the difference between the estimated monthly wage-earning capacity of the family member at the time of the qualifying incident and the monthly wage-earning capacity after the beginning of the partial disability, not to exceed one year's salary of the Principal may be authorized, using the criteria established by OWCP for such determination. \n\n(4) Special loss schedule. In addition to the temporary disability benefits payable in accordance with this subsection, if there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, a lump-sum payment may be authorized at the rate of 25 percent of the payment authorized in accordance with the schedule and procedures in 5 U.S.C. 8107 and 20 CFR 10.304. The Director General of the Foreign Service of State or the Agency Head, may at their discretion, authorize payments under this subpart in addition to payments for those organs and members of the body specified in 5 U.S.C. 8107 and in 20 CFR 10.304.

USAID will not finance transportation costs:\n\n(1) For shipment beyond the point of entry in the cooperating country except when intermodal transportation service covering the carriage of cargo from point of origin to destination is used, and the point of destination, as stated in the carrier's through bill of lading, is established in the carrier's tariff; or\n\n(2) On a transportation medium owned, operated or under the control of any country not included in Geographic Code 935; or\n\n(3) Under any ocean or air charter covering full or part cargo (whether for a single voyage, consecutive voyages, or a time period) which has not received prior approval by USAID/W, Office of Procurement, Transportation Division); or\n\n(4) Which are attributable to brokerage commissions which exceed the limitations specified in § 201.65(h) or to address commissions, dead freight, demurrage or detention.\n\n(c) Inspection services. USAID will finance inspection of USAID-financed commodities when inspection is required by USAID, or in those cases where inspection is required by the importer and such inspection is specified in the purchase contract, performed by independent inspectors and is either customary in export transactions for the commodity involved or is necessary to determine conformity of the commodities to the contract. Section 228.24 of this chapter covers the nationality requirements for suppliers of inspection services.\n\n(d) Marine insurance. (1) Unless otherwise authorized, USAID will finance premiums for marine insurance including war risk on USAID-financed commodities only if: \n\n(i) The insurance is placed in a country included in the authorized Geographic Code: Provided, that if the authorized Geographic Code is any other than USAID Geographic Code 000, the cooperating country itself shall be recognized as an eligible source; and\n\n(ii) Such insurance is placed either in accordance with the terms of the commodity purchase contract or on the written instructions of the importer; and \n\n(iii) Insurance coverage relates only to the period during which the commodities are in transit to the cooperating country, except that it may include coverage under a warehouse-to-warehouse clause; and \n\n(iv) The premiums do not exceed the limitations contained in § 201.68; and \n\n(v) The insurance provides that loss payment proceeds shall be paid in U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currency. \n\n(2) Within the meaning of § 201.11(e), as well as this paragraph, insurance is placed in a country only if payment of the insurance premium is made to, and the insurance policy is issued by, an insurance company office located in that country. \n\n(e) Suspension and debarment. In order to be eligible for USAID financing, the costs of any delivery services must be paid to carriers, insurers, or suppliers of inspection services who, prior to approval of the USAID Commodity Approval Application, have neither been suspended nor debarred under USAID Regulation 8, 22 CFR part 208, nor included on the “Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs” published by the U.S. General Services Administration. \n\n[55 FR 34232, Aug. 22, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 38027, July 16, 1997]",

Unless USAID determines that privately owned U.S. flag commercial ocean vessels are not available at fair and reasonable rates for such vessels: \n\n(1) At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross tonnage (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers from each of two geographic areas—the U.S. and all other countries) of all goods financed by USAID which are transported on ocean vessels shall be transported on privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels; and \n\n(2) At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross freight revenue generated by all shipments of USAID-financed commodities which are transported to the territory of the borrower/grantee on dry cargo liners shall be paid to or for the benefit of privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels. \n\n(b) Methods of compliance. (1) Compliance with these requirements with respect to dry cargo liner vessels shall be achieved for the total of liner shipments made during the term of the loan or grant agreement. If USAID determines at any time during the term of the agreement that compliance may not be achieved, USAID may require that all subsequent shipments be made on U.S. flag liners until compliance is assured. \n\n(2) Compliance with these requirements with respect to dry bulk carriers and tankers shall be achieved for each quantitative unit of cargo. A quantitative unit of cargo is the total tonnage of a commodity or commodities included in one invitation for bids or other solicitation of offers from ocean carriers for the transportation of cargo which may move in full shipload lots. USAID shall approve a charter or other contract of affreightment for a non-U.S. flag vessel only if USAID has determined that at least 50% of the quantitative unit will move on U.S. flag vessels, to the extent that such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for such vessels. U.S. flag dry cargo liners whose offers are responsive to the terms of the invitation for bids or other solicitation of vessels may be used for achieving compliance for the quantitative unit. \n\n(c) Nonavailability of U.S. flag vessels. Upon application of the borrower/grantee or the supplier, USAID/W, Office of Procurement, Transportation Division, shall determine and advise the applicant whether or not privately owned U.S. flag vessels are available for any specific shipment of commodities at fair and reasonable rates. A determination that U.S. flag vessels are not available does not carry with it the authorization for USAID to finance freight on a vessel not otherwise authorized; this requires a separate waiver approval in accordance with § 201.13(b)(1)(ii). \n\n(d) Responsibility. The borrower/grantee is responsible for compliance with the requirements of this section and for imposing upon subborrowers, contractors and importers such requirements regarding shipping arrangements with suppliers as will assure discharge of this responsibility. \n\n(e) Privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels. For purposes of this section the term “privately owned U.S. flag commercial vessels” shall not include any vessel which, subsequent to September 21, 1961, shall have been either built outside the U.S., rebuilt outside the U.S. or documented under any foreign registry until such vessel shall have been documented under the laws of the U.S. for a period of 3 years.",

          "content": "§ 201.22   Procurement under public sector procedures.\n(a) General requirements. When the importer is the government of the cooperating country or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, all purchase contracts for commodities shall be awarded under public sector procedures in this section unless otherwise authorized by USAID. Such contracts shall be awarded on a competitive basis unless otherwise authorized by USAID under paragraph (g) of this section. \n\n(b) Formal competitive bidding. Formal competitive bidding procedures shall be used for all procurements estimated to exceed $100,000 or the equivalent, exclusive of ocean or air transportation costs, except when other procedures are authorized in accordance with this section. Formal competitive bidding procedures may also be used for procurements under $100,000 at the option of the importer. Formal competitive bidding procedures include advertising the availability of an invitation for bids in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, issuance of the invitation for bids, public opening of sealed bids, evaluation of bids, and award of the contract, except as provided in § 201.22(b)(3), to the lowest responsive bid by a responsible bidder. \n\n(1) Contents of the invitation for bids. The invitation for bids and every attachment and amendment thereto shall be in the English language and shall be available to prospective suppliers free of charge unless otherwise authorized by USAID. The following minimum requirements are applicable: \n\n(i) Statement of requirements. The invitation for bids shall state specifically that the formal competitive bidding procedures set forth in this § 201.22 apply. The terms and conditions of the procurement shall be clearly indicated, including any factors other than price to be used in the evaluation. Commodity specifications shall be stated in a non-restrictive manner and in sufficient detail to permit maximum response from prospective suppliers. The metric system of measurements shall be used for specifications unless USAID determines in writing that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets to U.S. firms. \n\n(ii) Statement regarding submission of bids. The invitation for bids shall be appropriately numbered and state the complete physical address, as well as any post office box number, to which bids or offers are to be sent, the closing hour and date for submission and the date, hour and place of the public opening of the bids. If additional drawings, details, regulations or forms are necessary for submitting a bid, the invitation shall state where such material may be obtained. \n\n(iii) Statement regarding this part 201. The invitation for bids shall expressly indicate the extent to which any resulting contract is subject to the requirements of this part 201. \n\n(iv) Statement regarding late bids. The invitation for bids shall state that no bid received at the address designated in the invitation after the closing hour and date for submission will be considered for award unless its late arrival at that address is attributable solely to mishandling of the bid documents by the importer or any of its agents directly associated with receiving or processing the bids. In no case will the importer consider a bid which was not received at the place of public opening before the award was made. \n\n(2) Handling bids. Bids received shall be held intact and sealed and shall be safeguarded against disclosure of contents prior to bid opening. The bids shall be opened publicly as specified in the bid invitation, and all properly submitted bids shall be considered. Direct submission of a bid by a prospective supplier, rather than through an agent or other representative of the supplier in the cooperating country, shall not be cause for rejection. \n\n(3) Awards. Every award shall be made to that responsible bidder whose responsive bid is lowest in price. If any factor other than price is used in evaluating bids, each such factor shall be computed in accordance with the formula in the invitation for bids. \n\n(c) Two-stage formal competitive bidding. Subject to the approval of USAID, two-stage formal competitive bidding may be used in the procurement of specialized equipment, where requirements are stated in performance-type specifications. Two-stage bidding involves a request for technical proposals for the equipment being purchased, submission of proposals without price information, discussions with the offerors as necessary to clarify proposals, followed by a request for priced bids for those proposals found to be fully acceptable following discussions between the offerors and the purchaser. The priced bids shall be publicly opened. Handling and award of the bids shall comply with paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.\n\n(d) Competitive negotiation procedures. (1) If approved by USAID based on a written record of the reasons therefor, a competitive negotiation procedure may be used. Competitive negotiation procedures include advertising the availability of a request for quotations in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, issuance of the request for quotations, receipt and evaluation of offers, negotiation (when appropriate), and award of the contract to the offeror submitting the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered. Competitive negotiation procedures may be approved in the following circumstances: \n\n(i) When it is impossible to develop adequate commodity specifications for use in an invitation for bids; \n\n(ii) When price alone would not be an effective means of determining an award (i.e., when criteria, such as time of delivery or service capability need to be evaluated); \n\n(iii) When emergency procurement is justified by a demonstration that the time required for formal competitive bid procedures would result in an unacceptable delay in delivering the commodities; \n\n(iv) When proprietary procurement is justified; or \n\n(v) When adherence to formal competitive procedures would impair program objectives. \n\n(2) When formal competitive bidding procedures have failed, all bids have been rejected, and further use of such procedures would clearly not be productive, the Mission Director may authorize the use of competitive negotiation procedures. Further advertising is not required. The request for quotations may be prepared as a new document or may incorporate appropriate provisions of the invitation for bids. It shall be submitted to those potential suppliers who originally submitted bids in response to the invitation for bids. \n\n(e) Small value procurement. When the estimated value of the contract does not exceed $100,000 or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), the purchaser may award a contract by advertising the procurement in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section and soliciting quotations from a reasonable number of sources, including, where feasible, producers of the commodity, taking into consideration: \n\n(1) The nature of the commodities to be purchased; \n\n(2) The number of sources which can supply the commodities; \n\n(3) The value of the procurement; and \n\n(4) The administrative cost of procuring the commodities.\n\nThe contract shall be awarded to the offeror with the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered. \n\n(f) Proprietary procurement. Purchasing by brand or trade name or by a restrictive specification (proprietary procurement) may be justified for reasons such as: \n\n(1) Substantial benefits, such as economies in maintenance of spare parts inventories, stronger local dealer organization, better repair facilities, or greater familiarity by operating personnel, can be achieved through standardizing on a particular brand; \n\n(2) Compatibility with equipment on hand is required; or \n\n(3) Special design or operational characteristics are required.\n\nThe need for proprietary procurement may serve as the basis for approving the use of competitive negotiation procedures in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section or a waiver for negotiation with a single source in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. \n\n(g) Negotiation with a single source—(1) Circumstances. Competition may be waived and negotiation with a single source authorized by USAID under one of the following circumstances: \n\n(i) the purchaser can demonstrate the existence of an emergency situation in which the requirement for competition would result in an unacceptable delay in the procurement of the commodities; \n\n(ii) proprietary procurement is justified and the necessary commodities or spare parts are available from only one source, taking into account any special requirements such as the need for in-country service capability; or \n\n(iii) adherence to competitive procedures would result in the impairment of the objectives of the United States foreign assistance program or would not be in the best interest of the United States. \n\n(2) Amendments. Negotiation with a single source to amend an existing contract outside the scope of the contract must be justified under one or more of the criteria in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and formally approved by USAID. \n\n(h) Advertising—(1) Requirements. (i) For each procurement estimated to exceed $25,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), notice of the availability of the invitation for bids, request for quotations or specific information about procurements under $100,000 shall be published by the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Minority Resource Center in the appropriate USAID Bulletin. The purchaser shall submit three copies of each invitation for bids or request for quotations (if any) to the USAID Mission with its request for advertising. The Mission will forward the request for advertising and the procurement documents to USAID/W. The request for advertising should arrive in the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization/Minority Resource Center at least 45 days prior to the final date for receiving bids or quotations. The purchaser may, in addition, advertise in appropriate local, regional, and international journals, newspapers, etc., and otherwise, in accordance with local practice. \n\n(ii) Additionally, if the estimated value of the contract is more than $100,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), the notice of availability of the invitation for bids or request for quotations shall be published in the “Commerce Business Daily” of the U.S. Department of Commerce. \n\n(2) Exceptions. (i) When negotiation with a single source has been authorized, advertising is not required. \n\n(ii) When formal competitive bid procedures have failed to result in an award pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section and a determination is made to follow competitive negotiation procedures, no further advertising is required. \n\n(iii) The requirements for advertising as set forth above may be waived by USAID to avoid serious procurement delays in certain circumstances, provided, however, that efforts shall be made to secure bids or offers from a reasonable number of potential suppliers. \n\n(i) USAID approvals. (1) Each invitation for bids or request for quotations for an USAID-financed procurement which is estimated to exceed $100,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), must be approved by USAID prior to issuance. \n\n(2) Each contract in excess of $100,000, or equivalent (exclusive of ocean and air transportation costs), must be formally approved by USAID prior to finalization with the supplier. \n\n(3) USAID may require that contracts under $100,000 be formally approved prior to finalization with the supplier.",

Solicitations by the importer for quotations or offers shall be made uniformly to a reasonable number of prospective suppliers, including, where feasible, producers of a commodity, and all quotations or offers received, whether or not specifically solicited, shall be given consideration before making an award. \n\n(b) Publicizing. To provide suppliers in the United States with an opportunity to participate in furnishing commodities which may be purchased on a negotiated basis under USAID financing, USAID will periodically publish for each cooperating country a list of commodities which may be expected to be imported and the names and contact information for the importers which have traditionally purchased those commodities. Interested suppliers may then make offers or furnish quotations on the products they desire to sell directly to the importers of those products. USAID will not publicize specific proposed purchases which are to be undertaken by private sector importers on a negotiated basis unless specifically requested to do so by the importer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(c) Notification. If the importer elects to solicit quotations and offers for specific proposed purchases through publication by USAID, USAID will notify prospective suppliers of the export opportunity through the appropriate USAID bulletin.

The supplier of commodities shall comply with the terms and conditions of its contract with the importer and any letter of credit or direct letter of commitment under which it secures payment. \n\n(b) Responsibilities relating to eligibility of commodities. The supplier shall fulfill its responsibilities under § 201.11 by assuring that: \n\n(1) The commodity conforms to the description contained in its contract and letter of credit or direct letter of commitment and, unless otherwise authorized by USAID in writing, the commodity is unused and has not been disposed of as surplus by any governmental agency;\n\n(2) The source of the commodity complies with the provisions of § 201.11(b) relating to source as required by its contract, letter of credit or direct letter of commitment; \n\n(3) The provisions of § 201.11(d) relating to the medium of transportation are complied with to the extent that the supplier arranges such transportation; \n\n(4) All documents required by § 201.52 to be submitted by the supplier to receive payment are submitted by it on or before the terminal date specified in the letter of credit, direct letter of commitment, or, if payment is to be made at sight, the purchase contract; \n\n(5) The provisions of the U.S. Treasury Department Foreign Assets, Sanctions, Transactions and Funds Control Regulations published in 31 CFR parts 500 through 599, as from time to time amended, are complied with; and \n\n(6) The purchase price of the commodity meets the requirements of subpart G of this part applicable to the supplier.\n\n(c) Responsibilities relating to eligibility of delivery services. The supplier of commodities shall be responsible for assuring that any delivery services obtained by it for its own or for the importer's account comply with the requirements of § 201.13 and, if required by USAID, for assuring that any shipping documents obtained by it contain an appropriate diversion clause pursuant to § 201.43. The supplier shall deliver to USAID any shipping documents available to it whenever such delivery is requested by USAID. \n\n(d) Marking of shipping containers and commodities—(1) Affixing emblems and identification numbers. The supplier of commodities shall be responsible for assuring that all export packaging, whether shipped from the United States or from any other source country, carries the official USAID (clasped hands) emblem. Additionally, except as USAID may otherwise prescribe, when the supplier is given notice by the importer that the importer is the government of the cooperating country or any of its subdivisions or instrumentalities, the supplier shall also be responsible for assuring that, in addition to the shipping cartons or other export packaging, all commodities carry the USAID emblem. The USAID financing document number shall be marked on each export shipping carton and box in characters at least equal in height to the shipper's marks. When commodities are shipped as containerized freight in a reusable shipping container, the container is not considered export packaging within the meaning of this paragraph and the outside of the container need not be marked; however, the cartons, boxes, etc., inside the container must be marked. \n\n(i) Durability of emblems. Emblems shall be affixed by metal plate, decalcomania, stencil, label, tag or other means, depending upon the type of commodity or export packaging and the nature of the surface to be marked. The emblem placed on commodities shall be as durable as the trademark, commodity or brand name affixed by the producer; the emblem on each export packaging unit shall be affixed in a manner which assures that the emblem will remain legible until the unit reach the consignee. \n\n(ii) Size of emblems. The size of an emblem may vary depending upon the size of the commodity and the size of the export packaging. The emblem shall in every case be large enough to be clearly visible at a reasonable distance. \n\n(iii) Design and color of emblems. Emblems shall conform in design and color to samples available from the Office of Procurement, Commodity Support Division, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-1415, and from the Mission. \n\n(2) Exception to requirement for affixing emblems. To the extent compliance is impracticable, emblems shall not be required for: \n\n(i) Raw materials shipped in bulk (including grain, coal, petroleum, oil, and lubricants); \n\n(ii) Vegetable fibers packaged in bales; and \n\n(iii) Semifinished products which are not packaged in any way. \n\n(3) Waiver. If compliance with the marking requirement is found to be impracticable with respect to other commodities not excepted by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the supplier (or, when appropriate, the borrower/grantee) may request a waiver from USAID (Regional Assistant Administrator or his/her designee). \n\n(e) Export licenses and approvals. The supplier shall be solely responsible for assuring that all necessary export licenses and approvals are obtained.\n\n(f) Distribution of shipping documents. The supplier shall make the customary commercial document distribution, as well as any special distribution (e.g., to the USAID Mission in the importing country) which may be specified in the letter of credit, direct letter of commitment or other payment instruction covering the transaction. Prior to presenting the documents specified in § 201.52 for payment, the supplier shall mail not later than 30 days from the date of shipment a legible copy of all rated ocean bill(s) of lading described in § 201.52(a)(4)(i) to: Maritime Administration, Division of National Cargo, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590-0001; and Transportation Division, Office of Procurement, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7900. \n\n(g) Adjustment refunds, credits, and allowances. All adjustments in the purchase price in an USAID-financed transaction in favor of the importer arising out of the terms of the contract or the customs of the trade shall be made by the supplier in the form of a dollar payment to USAID. Any such payment shall be transmitted to the Office of Financial Management, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7702, and shall be accompanied by a statement explaining the adjustment and shall specify the name and address of the importer, the date and amount of the original invoice, and the identification number of the implementing document, if known, under which the original transaction was financed. USAID will advise the borrower/grantee of such adjustment refunds received. Despatch earned by the supplier, other than despatch earned at the port of loading on c.i.f. and c. & f. shipments, shall be refunded to USAID in accordance with § 201.67(a)(5). \n\n(h) Vesting in USAID of title to commodities. The supplier shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of § 201.44 applicable to it. \n\n(i) Termination or modification of USAID-financing. The supplier shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of § 201.45 applicable to it.\n\n[55 FR 34232, Aug. 22, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 17535, Apr. 12, 1999]",

At the request of the borrower/grantee, USAID will issue a letter of commitment to a bank for a specified amount in dollars. Reimbursement to a bank will be in accordance with the terms of such letter of commitment for sight payments made for the account of an approved applicant. Any such payment by a bank made in anticipation of a letter of commitment and falling within the scope of payments authorized by such letter of commitment when issued, will be deemed to be a payment to be reimbursed by USAID thereunder. \n\n(1) Requests for bank letters of commitment. All requests for bank letters of commitment shall be in the English language and shall be submitted to USAID by the borrower/grantee in duplicate.

The borrower/grantee's request to USAID for a letter of commitment shall be deemed notification to USAID of assignment of any rights to receive reimbursement for the specified funds under the related implementing document. USAID, by issuance of the letter of commitment, shall be deemed to have consented to such assignment. Any such assignment or consent shall inure to the benefit of the bank's legal successors and assignees. \n\n(iii) Requirements imposed by bank. The borrower/grantee and the approved applicant shall be deemed to have consented to imposition by the bank upon the beneficiary of any letter of credit or payment instruction of such requirements as the bank deems necessary in order to comply with its applicable obligations to USAID. Such consent shall be deemed an express condition incorporated in any request of the approved applicant under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. \n\n(3) Reimbursement of bank.

In testing whether the purchase price of a commodity exceeds the price in comparable export sales or in comparable domestic sales, as applicable under § 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), it is necessary to insure that the price being tested as well as the prices being used as a test or measurement are calculated on the basis of delivery alongside or on board the vessel or other export conveyance. Such prices will include, therefore, in addition to the price of the commodity at an internal point in the source country, transportation from that point to the port of export in the source country, and to the extent not already included in the price at the internal point, inspection, export packing, forwarder's fees at customary rates, the cost of placing the commodities on board the vessel or export conveyance (unless this cost is covered in the export freight), and other necessary costs customary in the trade. \n\n(b) Calculation of commodity prices which involve transportation costs. (1) In testing the purchase price which includes transportation cost (customarily known as a c. & f. or c.i.f. price) for compliance with the requirements of § 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), USAID will subtract transportation cost as calculated by reference to the freight rate, for the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity was shipped, prevailing on the date the purchase price is fixed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the actual transportation cost paid by the supplier shall be presumed to be the transportation cost calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the foregoing sentence. \n\n(2) In testing a purchase price involving transportation cost for compliance with §§ 201.62 and 201.63(b), the test or measurement prices shall be: \n\n(i) Prices based upon transportation by a U.S.-flag vessel if the price tested involves transportation by such vessel; or \n\n(ii) Prices based upon transportation by either a U.S.-flag or a foreign-flag vessel, whichever is lower, if the price tested involves transportation by a foreign-flag vessel. \n\n(c) Calculation of amount eligible for financing when shipment is through or out of a free port or bonded warehouse. (1) When a shipment to a cooperating country has passed through a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following: \n\n(i) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1), or \n\n(ii) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of § 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D), and any transportation costs out of the free port or bonded warehouse on a vessel flying the flag of a country included in the authorized geographic code. \n\n(2) When a shipment is f.o.b. or f.a.s. a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following: \n\n(i) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(2), or \n\n(ii) The maximum price described in § 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of § 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D). \n\n(d) Determination of prevailing prices. In the determination of any prevailing market price of any commodity or any prevailing price or maximum eligible freight rate for a commodity related service, relevant published and unpublished price information will be considered.",

Unless otherwise authorized by USAID, no commission or other payment, credit, benefit or allowance of any kind shall be paid, made, or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, in connection with any sale subject to this part by the supplier or its agent: \n\n(1) To or for the benefit of the importer; \n\n(2) To or for the benefit of a purchasing agent or other agent or representative of an importer, even though such agent or representative may also have an agreement with a supplier to represent the supplier; or \n\n(3) To any third party in connection with a sale by the supplier to its dealer, distributor, or established agent in the cooperating country. \n\n(d) Trade discounts. To arrive at the net amount eligible for USAID-financing, all trade discounts, whether in the form of payments, credits, or allowances, to which the importer is entitled shall be deducted from the gross amount of the supplier's invoice submitted under § 201.52(a)(2)(i)(D). \n\n(e) Commissions and other payments or benefits attributable to USAID-financing. Every commission or other payment, credit, benefit, or allowance of any kind paid, made or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, in connection with the sale of commodities financed under this part to any person described in § 201.65(c) (1), (2) or (3) shall be presumed conclusively to have been paid from USAID funds and shall thereby be subject to the requirements of this part 201. \n\n(f) Maximum commission. A commission shall not exceed the lesser of the amount which the supplier customarily pays in connection with similar transactions or the amount which is customary in the trade. \n\n(g) Reporting. All commissions and other payments, credits, benefits or allowances of any kind paid, made or given, or agreed to be paid, made or given, by the supplier in connection with USAID-financed sales of commodities and commodity-related services shall be fully reported on the Invoice-and-Contract Abstract of the Supplier's Certificate required under § 201.52(a)(6). Any such amounts not reported shall be ineligible for USAID-financing. \n\n(h) Brokerage commission. In connection with ocean freight services, USAID will finance a brokerage commission only if: \n\n(1) Such commission does not exceed 2\n1/2 percent of the ocean freight charge (exclusive of deadfreight, demurrage and detention); \n\n(2) Such commission is payable to an individual resident in a country included in the authorized source code; a non-resident citizen of a country included in the authorized source code; or a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of a country included in the authorized source code; and \n\n(3) The names of all persons receiving such commissions appear on the face of the charter party. \n\n(i) Address commissions. An address commission to or for the benefit of a charterer shall be deemed a discount on the stated freight rate or freight charge which the supplier of transportation services shall deduct from the cost of transportation financed by USAID. If the supplier of the commodity is the charterer, it shall refund to USAID any address commission received by it. If the supplier of the commodity is not the charterer, the borrower/grantee shall be responsible for making a refund to USAID of any such commissions received by the charterer.",

The documents submitted as evidence of the shipment of commodities under § 201.52(a)(4) shall be dated within the shipping period, if any, specified in the letter of commitment. The bill of lading shall contain the carrier's statement of charges whether or not freight is financed by USAID.\n\n(2) Source of commodities.

Any document, including the Supplier's Certificate and the Commodity Approval Application, submitted by a bank to USAID in support of a claim for reimbursement, shall be sufficient if it purports to be the sort required to be delivered and if it has been accepted by the bank in the ordinary course of business in good faith. Except as may be required in the discharge of its responsibilities under § 201.72 (b) and (c), the bank's right of reimbursement shall not be affected by the fact that any document required to be submitted by it is incomplete or may indicate noncompliance with any provision of this part.\n\n(b) Reimbursement right notwithstanding certain deficiencies. A bank's right to reimbursement from USAID for payments which the bank has made will not be affected by the fact that the Commodity Approval Application or the Invoice-and-Contract Abstract on the reverse of the Supplier's Certificate may be incomplete, or may indicate noncompliance with any provision of this part 201, the letter of commitment, or any other implementing document, or may be inconsistent with other documents required for reimbursement.\n\n(c) Nonresponsibility of bank for truth or accuracy of statements or certifications. The bank shall not be responsible for the truth or accuracy of any information or statement contained in any Supplier's Certificate or any other document certification to be submitted by it to USAID, notwithstanding any knowledge or information in the actual or constructive possession of the bank to the contrary. The bank shall not be obligated to look beyond the documents, including any certifications endorsed thereon, to be submitted by it or to make any independent investigation as to the truth or accuracy of any information or statement contained therein.\n\n(d) Protection of bank making payment. Acceptance by the bank of any document in the ordinary course of business in good faith as being a genuine and valid document and sufficient in the premises, and the delivery thereof to USAID, shall constitute full compliance by the bank with any provision of this part, the letter of commitment requiring delivery of a document of the sort that the document actually so delivered purports to be. The bank shall be entitled to receive and retain reimbursement of the amount of all payments made by it against documents so accepted, notwithstanding that such payments may be made in connection with a purchase in excess of the price calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions of subpart G. \n\n(e) Payment to third persons. The bank's right of reimbursement shall not be affected by the fact that payment is made to the approved applicant or at the request of the approved applicant or such beneficiary to a person other than the supplier under the contract to which such payment relates, if the bank has complied with all other requirements of the letter of commitment and has satisfied itself in good faith that the person to whom it makes payment has, in turn, made payment to the supplier.\n\n(f) Bank procedures with regard to certain suppliers. In the event a bank receives written advice from USAID concerning special conditions which are applicable to transactions of particular suppliers, such bank will use reasonable care to maintain procedures designed to ensure that accommodations thereafter furnished by it with respect to such suppliers by means of the issuance, confirmation, advising or transfer of letters of credit, or the making of payments not under letters of credit shall reflect such special conditions. While banks are expected to comply with the foregoing obligation, a bank which has used reasonable care to establish and maintain such procedures will not be responsible for any inadvertent furnishing of any such accommodation not containing applicable special conditions or the making of payment thereunder. For the purpose of ascertaining whether the supplier is a person or organization subject to an USAID advice concerning special conditions applicable to its transactions under this paragraph, a bank, in making payment under a letter of credit or otherwise, may consider as supplier the person or organization issuing the invoice. \n\n(g) Provision of implementing documents.

All FOIA requests for USAID records (other than OIG records) must be submitted to this office. To make a request for the Agency's records, a requester may send request via one of the following mediums:\n\n(1) By Email: foia@usaid.gov. Please include your mailing address, email address, phone number, and fee category with your request. While our FOIA Specialists are happy to answer questions about the FOIA Program and/or help you formulate your request over the phone, please be advised that FOIA requests cannot be accepted by phone.\n\n(2) Online Portal: To submit your request online, please click the subsequent link: https://foiarequest.usaid.gov/index.aspx.\n\n(3) By U.S. Postal Mail: United States Agency for International Development Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services Services, Information and Records Division USAID Annex, Room 2.4.0A, Washington, DC 20523.\n\n(4) By Telephone: (202) 916-4661.\n\n(5) By Fax: (202) 916-4990.\n\n(c) The Inspector General has received delegated authority from USAID's Administrator to process requests and issue determinations with respect to requests, and appeals of initial denials of requests, for the OIG's records. To make a request for OIG records, a requester may send a request via one of the following mediums:\n\n(1) By email: foiaoig@usaid.gov. Please include your mailing address, email address, phone number, and fee category with your request.\n\n(2) Online Portal: Please submit a request online via the OIG website at https://oig.usaid.gov/FOIA.\n\n(3) By U.S. Postal Mail: United States Agency of International Development Office of Inspector General, Office of General Counsel 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 6.06-D, Washington, DC 20523.\n\n(4) By Telephone: (202) 712-1150.\n\n(d) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized consent form signed by the person who is the subject of the records, or a signed declaration by that person, made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). In addition, requesters may present an argument that there exists an overriding public interest in disclosure of the information related to official misconduct by producing evidence that alleged Government impropriety occurred. As an exercise of administrative discretion, the component's FOIA office can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(e) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable the component's FOIA office personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component FOIA office's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If, after receiving a request, the component's FOIA office determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component's FOIA office shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component FOIA office's designated FOIA Specialist or its FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component FOIA office's response to the request may be delayed or denied.",

(i) When a component's FOIA office believes that a different Department, agency, or component, is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component's FOIA office will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to an agency that is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component's FOIA office and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n\n(ii) Whenever the component's FOIA office refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.\n\n(iii) Where a component's FOIA office determines that a request was misdirected within the agency, the receiving component's FOIA office must route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component within the agency.\n\n(3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component's FOIA office will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will then be conveyed to the requester by the component's FOIA office.\n\n(d) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component's FOIA office must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the component's FOIA office must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever USAID's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the component's FOIA office must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(e) Furnishing records. The component's FOIA office shall furnish copies only of records that the Agency has in its possession. The Agency is not compelled to create new records. The Agency is not required to perform research for a requester. The component's FOIA office is required to furnish only one copy of a record. If information exists in different forms, the component's FOIA office will provide the record in the form that best conserves government resources. Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought by the requester. The component's FOIA office will accommodate the form or format request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.\n\n(f) Archival records. The Agency ordinarily transfers records in accordance with its retirement authority, included in ADS 502, to the National Archives and Records Administration. These records become the physical and legal custody of the National Archives. Accordingly, requests for retired Agency records should be submitted to the National Archives by mail addressed to Special Access and FOIA Staff (NWCTF), 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500, College Park, MD 20740 by fax to (301) 837¬1864 or by email to specialaccess_foia@nara.gov.\n\n(g) Poor copy. If USAID cannot make a legible copy of a record to be released, the Agency is not required to reconstruct it. Instead, the component's FOIA office will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in the component's FOIA office reply.",

          "content": "212.8   Time limits.\n(a) In general. The component's FOIA office ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. (1) The component's FOIA office shall designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The component's FOIA office may designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the component's FOIA office may consider are, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The component's FOIA office shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.\n\n(2) The component's FOIA office shall generally process requests in each track on a “first-in, first-out” basis.\n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component's FOIA office extends the time limit on that basis, the component's FOIA office shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component's FOIA office shall, in the written notice, notify the requester of the right to contact the component's FOIA office's FOIA Public Liaison, or seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). In addition, the component's FOIA office shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing.\n\n(d) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the component's FOIA office may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The component's FOIA office shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.\n\n(e) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;\n\n(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or\n\n(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\n\n(2) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the component's FOIA office may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(3) The component's FOIA office shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.",

The component's FOIA office shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number. The component's FOIA office shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.\n\n(c) Grants of requests. Once the component's FOIA office makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The component's FOIA office also shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.\n\n(d) Consultations and referrals. Whenever the component's FOIA office consults with another Federal Government office over the releasability of a record, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of the consultation and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency or office with which the consultation is taking place. Whenever the component's FOIA office refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another Federal Government office, the component's FOIA office shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, notify the requester of the referral, and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.\n\n(e) Adverse determinations of requests. If the component's FOIA office has made an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of that determination in writing, and provide the contact information for the FOIA Public Liaison, as well as a description of the requester's right to seek mediation services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. A response will provide an estimate of the volume of any records or any information withheld. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(f) Information furnished. All denials are in writing and describe in general terms the material withheld; state the reasons for the denial, including, as applicable, a reference to the specific exemption of the FOIA authorizing the withholding; explain your right to appeal the decision and identify the official to whom you should send the appeal; and are signed by the person who made the decision to deny all or part of the request. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(g) Conducting searches. USAID performs a diligent search for records to satisfy your request. Nevertheless, the Agency may not be able to find the records requested using the information provided, or the records may not exist.",

(1) Confidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by the Agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).\n\n(2) Business submitter means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.\n\n(b) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.\n\n(c) When notice to business submitters is required. (1) The component's FOIA office shall promptly provide written notice to a business submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component's FOIA office determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the business submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) The component's FOIA office has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.\n\n(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.\n\n(d) Exceptions to business submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:\n\n(1) The component's FOIA office determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the business submitter appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component's FOIA office shall give the business submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) The component's FOIA office shall specify a reasonable time period within which the business submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (c) of this section. If a business submitter has any objections to disclosure, the business submitter should:\n\n(i) Provide the component's FOIA office with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the business submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(2) A business submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component's FOIA office after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the component's FOIA office. Any information provided by a business submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(f) Analysis of objections. The component's FOIA office shall consider a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever the component's FOIA office decides to disclose information over the objection of a business submitter, the component's FOIA office shall provide the business submitter written notice, which shall include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the business submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.\n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component's FOIA office shall promptly notify the business submitter.\n\n(i) Requester notification. The component's FOIA office shall notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.",

A requester may appeal the withholding of a document or denial of a fee waiver request. A requester may contest the type or amount of fees that were charged, or may appeal any other type of adverse determination under the FOIA. A requester may also appeal because USAID failed to conduct an adequate search for the documents requested. However, a requester may not file an administrative appeal for the lack of a timely response. A requester may administratively appeal any portion denied when their request is granted in part and denied in part.\n\n(b) Requirements for making an appeal. A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the component's FOIA office. The requester must make the appeal in writing. To be considered timely, the appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the component FOIA office's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(c) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The Deputy Director of the Bureau for Management Services or designee will conduct de novo review and make the final determination on the appeals related to all Agency records other than OIG records. The Deputy Inspector General will conduct de novo review and make the final determination on the appeals relating to OIG records.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(d) Decisions on appeals. A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds the component FOIA office's determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Mediation is a voluntary process. If the component's FOIA office agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the component FOIA office's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component's FOIA office will thereafter further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.\n\n(e) When appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of the component FOIA office's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.\n\n(f) Where to file an appeal. An appeal (other than appeals related to OIG records) may be filed by sending a letter to: FOIA Appeals Officer, Bureau for Management, Deputy Director, Office of Management Services, U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID Annex, M/MS, Room 10.8 OD, Washington, DC 20523; or by email at foia@usaid.gov. An appeal relating to OIG records may be filed by sending a letter to: Deputy Inspector General, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development, Suite 6.06-D, RRB, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20523-4601; or by email at foiaoig@usaid.gov.

The component's FOIA office shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the component's FOIA office may contact a requester for additional information. The component's FOIA office shall ensure that search, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The component's FOIA office ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The component FOIA office's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.\n\n(2) Direct costs are those expenses that the Agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.\n\n(3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Agencies may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.\n\n(5) Fee waiver is a waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.\n\n(6) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.\n\n(7) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.\n\n(8) Requester category is one of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The three categories are: commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and all other requesters.\n\n(9) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(10) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the component's FOIA office shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section.\n\n(1) Search. Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The component's FOIA office may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The component's FOIA office shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component's FOIA office in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component's FOIA office shall provide one copy per request at a cost of ten cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time shall be charged. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the component's FOIA office shall charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by the component's FOIA office to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the component's FOIA office re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.\n\n(d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for commercial use.\n\n(2) When the component's FOIA office determines that unusual circumstances apply to the processing of a request, and the component's FOIA office has provided timely written notice to the requester, the delay is excused for an additional 10 days. If the component's FOIA office fails to comply with the extended time limit, it may not charge search fees (or for requesters with preferred fee status, may not charge duplication fees) except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.\n\n(i) Exception. If unusual circumstances apply and more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component's FOIA office may charge search fees (or, for requesters in preferred fee status, may charge duplication fees) if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the component's FOIA office has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.\n\n(ii) Court Determination that exceptional circumstances exist. If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the component's FOIA office's failure to comply with a time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) If the component's FOIA office fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees.\n\n(4) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(5) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the component's FOIA office shall provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(6) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When the component's FOIA office determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component's FOIA office shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component's FOIA office shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The component's FOIA office is not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component's FOIA office estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component's FOIA office shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component's FOIA office shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) The component's FOIA office shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA Specialists to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if the component's FOIA office chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(g) Charging interest. The component's FOIA office may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component's FOIA office. The component's FOIA office shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(h) Aggregating requests. When the component's FOIA office reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component's FOIA office may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The component's FOIA office may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the component's FOIA office will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.\n\n(i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the component's FOIA office shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When the component's FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The component's FOIA office may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the component's FOIA office within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the component's FOIA office may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component's FOIA office may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component's FOIA office begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If the component's FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which the component's FOIA office requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component FOIA office's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n\n(j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component's FOIA office shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.\n\n(k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (c) of this section, where the component's FOIA office determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government, the component's FOIA office shall consider all four of the following factors:\n\n(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\n\n(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, the component's FOIA office shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.\n\n(3) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the component's FOIA office shall consider the following factors:\n\n(i) The component's FOIA office shall identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(ii) A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The component's FOIA office ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.\n\n(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component's FOIA office and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received. A requester may appeal the denial of a fee waiver.",

          "content": "§ 212.16   Glossary.\nAs used in this part:\n\nAdministrative FOIA Appeal is an independent review of the initial determination made in response to a FOIA request. Requesters who are dissatisfied with the response made on their initial request have a statutory right to appeal the initial determination made by the component's FOIA office.\n\nAgency is any executive agency, military agency, government corporation, government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any independent regulatory agency. Thus, USAID is an agency.\n\nComplex request is a request that typically seeks a high volume of material or requires additional steps to process such as the need to search for records in multiple locations.\n\nConsultation is when USAID locates a record that contains information of substantial interest to another agency, and the component's FOIA office asks for the views of that other agency on the disclosability of the records before any final determination is made.\n\nDiscretionary disclosure is information that the component's FOIA office releases even though it could have been withheld under one of the FOIA's exemptions.\n\nDuplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\nElectronic record is any information that is recorded in a form that only a computer can process and that satisfies the definition of a Federal record per the Federal Records Act. Federal electronic records are not necessarily kept in a “recordkeeping system” but may reside in a generic electronic information system or are produced by an application such as word processing or electronic mail.\n\nExemptions are nine categories of information that are not required to be released in response to a FOIA request because release would be harmful to a government or private interest. These categories are called “exemptions” from disclosures.\n\nExpedited processing is the FOIA response track granted in certain limited situations, specifically when a FOIA request is processed ahead of other pending requests.\n\nFreedom of Information Act or FOIA is a United States Federal law that grants the public access to information possessed by government agencies. Upon written request, U.S. Government agencies are required to release information unless it falls under one of nine exemptions listed in the Act.\n\nFrequently requested records are records that have been requested three (3) or more times from the component's FOIA office.\n\nMulti-track processing is a system that divides in-coming FOIA requests according to their complexity so that simple requests requiring relatively minimal review are placed in one processing track and more complex requests are placed in one or more other tracks. Requests granted expedited processing are placed in yet another track. Requests in each track are processed on a first-in/first-out basis.\n\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and agencies as an alternative to litigation. OGIS also reviews agency FOIA compliance, policies, and procedures and makes recommendations for improvement. The Office is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration, and was created by Congress as part of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended the FOIA.\n\nProactive disclosures are records made publicly available by agencies without waiting for a specific FOIA request. Agencies now post on their websites' material concerning their functions and mission. The FOIA itself requires agencies to make available certain categories of information, including final opinions and orders, specific policy statements, certain administrative staff manuals and frequently requested records.\n\nRecord means information regardless of its physical form or characteristics including information created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means that is created or obtained by the Agency and under the control of the Agency at the time of the request, including information maintained for the Agency by an entity under Government contract for records management purposes. It does not include records that are not already in existence and that would have to be created specifically to respond to a request. Information available in electronic form shall be searched and compiled in response to a request unless such search and compilation would significantly interfere with the operation of the Agency's automated information systems.\n\nReferral occurs when an agency locates a record that originated with, or is of otherwise primary interest to another Department, agency, or component. It will forward that record to the other agency to process the record and to provide the final determination directly to the requester.\n\nSimple request is a FOIA request that a component's FOIA office anticipates will involve a small volume of material or which will be able to be processed relatively quickly.",

          "content": "§ 212.20   Request for access to records.\n(a) In general. Requests for access to records (other than OIG records) under the PA must be made in writing and mailed to the Bureau for Management Services, Information and Records Division at the address given in § 212.5. Requests for access to OIG records under the PA must be made in writing and mailed to the Office of General Counsel for the OIG at the address given in § 212.5.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requests for access should describe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit identification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include the individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and any other names used, current complete mailing address, (city, state and country). Helpful data includes the approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that give the individual reason to believe that the agency maintains a record under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if known, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In certain instances, it may be necessary for the component's FOIA office to request additional information from the requester, either to ensure a full search, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to the individual.\n\n(c) Verification of personal identity. The component's FOIA office will require reasonable identification of individuals requesting records about themselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are only accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full name, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien status, and date (city, state, and country). The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. If the requester seeks records under another name the requester has used, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has also used the other name must be included.\n\n(d) Third party access. The component's FOIA office may process third party requests, as described in this section. In the absence of a request by, or prior written consent of, the individual to whom the records pertain, the component's FOIA office will process third party requests under the FOIA. The Agency's form, AID 507-1, may be used to certify the identity and provide third party authorization.\n\n(1) Parents and guardians of minor children. Upon presentation of acceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a parent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person under the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under the PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors may request such records on their own behalf.\n\n(2) Guardians. A guardian of an individual who has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on behalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate documentation of the guardian relationship.\n\n(3) Authorized representatives or designees. Third-party access to an individual's records shall be granted pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual. The designated third party must submit identity verification information described in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(e) Referrals and consultations. If the component's FOIA office determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another Department, agency, or component it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency for direct response to the requester. If the agency determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request are of interest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before responding to the request. The component's FOIA office may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.\n\n(f) Records relating to civil actions. Nothing in this subpart entitles an individual to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.\n\n(g) Time limits. The component's FOIA office will acknowledge the request promptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible thereafter.",

Any such appeal must be postmarked within 60 working days of the date of the component FOIA office's denial letter and sent to: Appeals Officer, Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services (for non-OIG records), and Deputy Inspector General, Office of Inspector General (for OIG records) at the addresses given in § 212.11.\n\n(b) Appellants should submit an administrative appeal of any denial, in whole or in part, of a request for access to the PA at the above address.

If the 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) exemption claimed under § 215.13(c) of this chapter and on the notice of systems of records to be published in the Federal Register on this same date is held to be invalid, then this system is determined to be exempt, under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and (k)(1) and (2) of the Act, from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) through (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemptions are to protect the materials required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy, to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel.\n\n(2) Personnel Security and Suitability Investigatory Records.

USAID will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.\n\n(1) Interest begins to accrue on all delinquent debts starting from the day after the payment due date established in the initial written demand-for payment notice to the debtor. USAID will assess an annual rate of interest that is equal to the U.S. Department of the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) unless a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Federal Government. USAID will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.\n\n(2) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is executed. \n\n(3) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costs or late payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalties charges have been waived under the defaulted agreement, these charges can be reinstated and added to the debt principal under any new agreement and interest charged on the entire amount of the debt. \n\n(b) Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. The costs of the Agency's administrative handling of overdue debts including charges assessed by Treasury in cross-servicing USAID debts, based on either actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts except those owed by State and local governments and Indian tribes. These costs include both direct and indirect costs. \n\n(c) Penalties. As provided by 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), a penalty charge will be assessed on all debts, except those owned by State and local governments and Indian tribes, more than 90 days delinquent. The penalty charge will be at a rate not to exceed 6% per annum and will be assessed monthly. \n\n(d) Allocation of payments. A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding administrative costs, second to penalty assessments, third to accrued interest and then to the outstanding debt principal. \n\n(e) Waivers for the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. (1) The CFO will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The CFO may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by case basis, when he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Federal Government. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final, and is not subject to further review.\n\n(2) The CFO may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive the collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalties, or administrative costs, when he or she determines that—\n\n(i) A waiver is justified under the standards for the compromise of claims under § 213.25; or\n\n(ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of the United States.\n\n(3) The CFO may make a decision to waive interest, penalties, or administrative costs at any time.\n\n[67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002.

          "content": "§ 213.13   Waivers of indebtedness.\nThe CFO may grant waivers of indebtedness for certain types of debt identified in Federal statutes under the following waiver authorities:\n\n(a) Waiver authorities—(1) Debts that arise out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances, and of travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances. Title 5 U.S.C. 5584 provides the authority for waiving, in whole or in part, debts that arise out of erroneous payments of pay or allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances to an employee of USAID, if collection would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States:\n\n(i) The CFO may not grant a waiver if there exists in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person who has an interest in obtaining a waiver.\n\n(ii) Fault is considered to exist if, in light of the circumstances, the employee knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, that an error existed, but he or she failed to take corrective action. What an employee should have known is evaluated under a reasonable-person standard. However, employees are expected to have a general understanding of the Federal pay system applicable to them.\n\n(iii) An employee with notice that a payment might be erroneous is expected to make provisions for eventual repayment. Financial hardship is not a basis for granting a waiver for an employee who was on notice of an erroneous payment.\n\n(iv) If the deciding official finds no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person who has an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatically entitled to a waiver. Before granting a waiver, the deciding official also must determine that collection of the claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience, or not in the best interests of the United States, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom the Agency seeks collection;\n\n(B) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the employee either has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of his or her financial circumstances;\n\n(C) The time elapsed between the erroneous payment and the discovery of the error and notification of the employee;\n\n(D) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee; and\n\n(E) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.\n\n(2) Debts that arise out of advances in pay (5 U.S.C. 5524a); situations of Authorized or Ordered Departures (5 U.S.C. 5522); or allowances and differentials for employees stationed abroad (5 U.S.C. 5922). Title 5 U.S.C. 5524a, 5522, or 5922 provide authority for waiving, in whole or in part, a debt that arises out of such an advance payment if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:\n\n(i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of an advance payment would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Death of the employee;\n\n(B) Retirement of the employee for disability;\n\n(C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and\n\n(D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(3) Debts that arise out of employee training expenses. Title 5 U.S.C. 4108 provides the authority for waiving, in whole or in part, a debt that arises out of employee training expenses if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:\n\n(i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of a debt that arises out of employee training expenses would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Death of the employee;\n\n(B) Retirement of the employee for disability;\n\n(C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and\n\n(D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(4) Under-withholding of life insurance premiums. Title 5 U.S.C. 8707(d) provides the authority for waiving the collection of unpaid deductions that result from the underwithholding of premiums under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program if the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:\n\n(i) Fault is considered to exist if, in light of the circumstances, the employee knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, that an error existed, but he or she failed to take corrective action:\n\n(ii) Factors to consider when determining whether the recovery of unpaid deduction that results from under-withholding would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the individual from whom the Agency seeks collection;\n\n(B) The time elapsed between the failure to withhold properly and the discovery of the failure and notification of the individual;\n\n(C) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the individual; and\n\n(D) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.\n\n(5) Student-Loan Repayment Program service agreements. Title 5 U.S.C. 5379 provides for waiving, in whole or in part, debt that arises from the Student Loan Repayment Program if it is shown that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest:\n\n(i) Factors to consider when determining if recovery of a debt that arises out of the Student-Loan Repayment Program would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Death of the employee;\n\n(B) Retirement of the employee for disability;\n\n(C) Inability of the employee to return to duty because of disability (supported by an acceptable medical certificate); and\n\n(D) Whether failure to repay would result in unfair gain to the employee.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(b) [Reserved]\n\n[86 FR 31142, June 11, 2021]",

However, where the CFO determines that a debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in a single payment or that an alternative payment mechanism is in the best interest of the United States, the CFO may approve repayment of the debt in installments. The debtor has the burden of establishing that it is financially unable to pay the debt in a single payment or that an alternative payment mechanism is warranted. If the CFO agrees to accept payment by installments, the CFO may require a debtor to execute a written agreement which specifies all the terms of the repayment arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default. The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than 3 years, unless the CFO determines that a longer period is required.

          "content": "§ 213.20   Administrative offset of non-employee debts.\nThis subpart provides for USAID's collection of debts by administrative offset under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, other statutory authorities and offsets or recoupments under common law. It does not apply to offsets against employee salaries covered by §§ 213.21, 213.22 and 213.23 of this subpart. USAID will collect debts by administrative offsets where it determines that such collections are feasible and are not otherwise prohibited by statute or contract. USAID will decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether collection by administrative offset is feasible and that its use furthers and protects the interest of the United States. \n\n(a) Standards. (1) The CFO collects debts by administrative offset only after USAID has sent the debtor a written demand-for-payment notice that outlines the type and amount of the debt, the intention of the Agency to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and explaining the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716.\n\n(2) Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor has been given: \n\n(i) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt; \n\n(ii) The opportunity for a review within USAID of the Agency's decision related to the claim(s); and\n\n(iii) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt. \n\n(3) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section may be omitted when: \n\n(i) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;\n\n(ii) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or \n\n(iii) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (g) of this section, USAID first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, USAID shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the USAID. \n\n(4) When USAID previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt, USAID need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated. \n\n(b) Interagency offset. The CFO may offset a debt owed to another Federal Department or Agency from amounts due or payable by USAID to the debtor, or may request another Federal Department or Agency to offset a debt owed to USAID. The CFO, through USAID's cross-servicing arrangement with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, may request the Internal Revenue Service to offset an overdue debt from a Federal income-tax refund due to the debtor. Fiscal Service may also garnish the salary of a private-sector employee when reasonable attempts to obtain payment have failed. USAID will make interagency offsets from an employee's salary in accordance with the procedures contained in §§ 213.22 and 213.23.\n\n(c) Alternative repayment. The CFO may, at the CFO's discretion, enter into a repayment agreement with the debtor in lieu of offset. In deciding whether to accept payment of the debt by an alternative repayment agreement, the CFO may consider such factors as the amount of the debt, the length of the proposed repayment period, past Agency dealings with the debtor, documentation submitted by the debtor indicating that an offset will cause undue financial hardship, and the debtor's financial ability to adhere to the terms of a repayment agreement. The CFO may require financial documentation from the debtor before considering the repayment arrangement. \n\n(d) Review of a decision to offset the debt. (1) USAID will not offset the debt while a debtor is seeking review of the debt under this section, or under another statute, regulation, or contract. However, interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue during this period, unless otherwise waived by the CFO. The CFO may initiate offset as soon as practical after the completion of a review, or after a debtor waives the opportunity to request review.\n\n(2) The debtor must provide a written request for review of the decision to offset the debt no later than 15 days after the date of the notice of the offset unless a different time is specifically prescribed. The debtor's request must state the basis for the request for review. \n\n(3) The CFO may grant an extension of time for filing a request for review if the debtor shows good cause for the late filing. A debtor who fails timely to file or to request an extension waives the right to review. \n\n(4) The CFO will issue, no later than 60 days after the filing of the request, a written final decision based on the evidence, record and applicable law. \n\n(e) Multiple debts. Where moneys are available for offset against multiple debts of a debtor, it will be applied in accordance with the best interest of the Government as determined by the CFO on a case-by-case basis. \n\n(f) Non-centralized administrative offset. (1) Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that creditor agencies conduct, at the agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor Agency  may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. \n\n(2) Before requesting a payment authorizing agency to conduct a non-centralized administrative offset, USAID's regulations provides that such offsets may occur only after: \n\n(i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and \n\n(ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written certification from the creditor Agency that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor Agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset. \n\n(3) USAID as a payment authorizing agency will comply with offset requests by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to USAID's program, or would otherwise be contrary to law. \n\n(4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, USAID will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations. \n\n(g) Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (a) of this section, USAID may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.\n\n[67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002, as amended at 86 FR 31143, June 11, 2021]",

The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed USAID and debts owed to other Federal Departments and Agencies by USAID's employees. USAID will make every effort reasonably and lawfully possible to collect administratively any amounts owed by its employees prior to initiating collection by salary offset. An amount advanced to an employee for per diem or mileage allowances in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, but not used for allowable travel expenses, is recoverable from the employee by salary offset without regard to the due-process provisions in § 213.22. This section does not apply to debts for which another statute collection explicitly provides for, or prohibits, salary offset (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee-training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108).\n\n(c) References.

(1) Prior to initiating collection action through salary offset, USAID will first provide the employee with the opportunity to pay in full the amount owed, unless such notification will compromise the Government's ultimate ability to collect the debt. \n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each employee from whom the Agency proposes to collect a debt by salary offset under this section is entitled to receive a written notice as described in paragraph (c) of this section. \n\n(3) Each employee owing a debt to the United States that will be collected by salary offset is entitled to request a hearing on the debt. This request must be filed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. The Agency will make appropriate hearing arrangements that are consistent with law and regulations. Where a hearing is held, the employee is entitled to a written decision on the following issues: \n\n(i) The determination of the Agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt; and \n\n(ii) The repayment schedule, if it was not established by written agreement between the employee and the Agency. \n\n(b) Exceptions to due process requirements—pay and allowances. The procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not applicable to overpayments of pay or allowances caused by the following:\n\n(1) Any adjustment of pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program (such as health insurance) requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. However, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over more than four pay periods the full procedures prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section will be extended to the employee; \n\n(2) Routine intra-agency adjustment in pay or allowances that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred with the 4 pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment; or \n\n(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment. \n\n(c) Notification before deductions begin. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, deductions will not be made unless the employee is first provided with a minimum of 30 calendar days written notice. Notice will be sent by mail and must include the following: \n\n(1) The Agency's determination that a debt is owed, including the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; \n\n(2) The Agency's intention to collect the debt by means of deductions from the employee's current disposable pay account; \n\n(3) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date and duration of the intended deductions. (The proposed beginning date for salary offset cannot be earlier than 30 days after the date of notice, unless this would compromise the Government's ultimate ability to resolve the debt); \n\n(4) An explanation of the requirements concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs;\n\n(5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records relating to the debt or to request and receive a copy of such records; \n\n(6) If not previously provided, the employee's right to enter into a written agreement for a repayment schedule differing from that proposed by the Agency where the terms of the proposed repayment schedule are acceptable to the Agency. (Such an agreement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate USAID official and will be included in the debt file); \n\n(7) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official not under the control of USAID, if a request is filed; \n\n(8) The method and time for requesting a hearing; \n\n(9) That the filing of a request for hearing within 15 days of receipt of the original notification will stay the assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, and the commencement of collection proceedings;\n\n(10) That a final decision on the hearing (if requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but no later than 60 days after the filing of the request, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;\n\n(11) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations or evidence may subject the employee to—\n\n(i) Disciplinary procedures under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 or any other applicable statutes or regulations; \n\n(ii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002 or other applicable statutory authority; or \n\n(iii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or any other applicable statutory authority;\n\n(12) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and \n\n(13) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.\n\n(d) Request for a hearing. An employee may request a hearing by filing a written, signed request to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, United States Agency for International Development, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, USAID Annex, Room 8.80D, Washington, DC 20523-4601. The request must state the basis upon which the employee disputes the proposed collection of the debt. The employee must sign the request, and USAID must receive it within 15 days of his or her receipt of the notification of proposed deductions. The employee should submit, in writing, all facts, evidence, and witnesses that support his or her position to the CFO within 15 days of the date of the request for a hearing. The CFO will arrange for the services of a hearing official not under the control of USAID, and will provide the hearing official with all documents relating to the claim.\n\n(e) Requests for hearing made after time expires. Late requests for a hearing may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay in filing the request for a hearing was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n\n(f) Form of hearing, written response, and final decision. (1) Normally, a hearing will consist of the hearing official's making a decision based on a review of the claims file and any materials submitted by the debtor. However, in instances in which the hearing official determines that the validity of the debt turns on an issue of veracity or credibility that the review of documentary evidence cannot resolve, the hearing official, at his or her discretion, may afford the debtor an opportunity for an oral hearing. Such an oral hearing will consist of a conference before a hearing official in which the employee and the Agency will have the opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument. If desired, the employee may be represented by an individual of his or her choice. The Agency shall maintain a summary record of oral hearings provided under the procedures in this section.\n\n(2) Written decisions provided after a request for hearing will, at a minimum, state the facts evidencing the nature and origin of the alleged debt; and the hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions. \n\n(3) The decision of the hearing official is final and binding on the parties. \n\n(g) Request for waiver. In certain instances, an employee may have a statutory right to request a waiver of overpayment of pay or allowances (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 5 U.S.C. 5724(i)). When an employee requests waiver consideration under a right authorized by statute, the Agency will suspend further collection on the debt until it makes a final administrative decision on the waiver request. However, when it appears that an employee's resignation, termination, or other action may prejudice the Government's ability to recover the debt, the suspension of recovery is not required. During the period of the suspension, USAID will not assess interest, penalties, charges, and administrative costs against the debt. The Agency will not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the procedures already provided the debtor under a request for waiver. See § 213.13.\n\n(h) Method and source of collection. A debt will be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions at established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Agency agree to alternative arrangements for payment. The alternative payment schedule must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the CFO and will be documented in the Agency's files. \n\n(i) Limitation on amount of deduction. The size and frequency of installment deductions generally will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payments will be in amounts sufficient to liquidate the debt in three years or less. Installment payments of less than $50 normally will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances. \n\n(j) Duration of deduction. If the employee is financially unable to pay a debt in a lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay, collection will be made in installments. Installment deductions will be made over the period of active duty or employment except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. \n\n(k) When deductions may begin. (1) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will begin on the date stated in the Agency's written demand-for-payment notice of intention to collect, from the employee's current pay unless he or she has paid the debt or filed a timely request for a hearing on issues for which a hearing is appropriate.\n\n(2) If the employee has filed a timely request for hearing with the Agency, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a final written decision indicating the amount owed the Government. Following the decision by the hearing official, the employee will be given 30 days to repay the amount owed prior to collection through salary offset, unless otherwise provided by the hearing official. \n\n(l) Liquidation from final check. If the employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.). \n\n(m) Recovery from other payments due a separated employee. If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due the employee on the date of separation, USAID will liquidate the debt, where appropriate, by administrative offset from later payments of any kind due the former employee (e.g., retirement pay). Such administrative offset will be taken in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 213.20.\n\n(n) Interest, penalties, and administrative cost. USAID will assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts collected under the procedures in this section. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue during the period that the debtor is seeking a review of the debt or requesting a waiver. The following guidelines apply to the assessment of these costs on debts collected by salary offset:\n\n(1) USAID will start to assess interest on all debts not collected by the payment due date specified in the initial written demand-for-payment notice. USAID will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.\n\n(2) Administrative costs will be assessed if the debt is referred to Treasury for cross-servicing. \n\n(3) Deductions by administrative offset normally begin prior to the time for assessment of a penalty. Therefore, USAID will not assess a penalty charge unless deductions occur more than 90 days from the due date in the initial written demand-for-payment notice.\n\n(o) Non-waiver of right by payment. An employee's payment under protest of all or any portion of a debt does not waive any rights that the employee may have under either the procedures in this section or any other provision of law.\n\n(p) Refunds. USAID will promptly refund to the employee amounts paid or deducted pursuant to this section, the recovery of which is subsequently waived or otherwise found not owing to the United States. Refunds do not bear interest unless specifically authorized by law. \n\n(q) Time limit for commencing recovery by salary setoff. USAID will not initiate salary offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known and could not have been known through the exercise of reasonable care by the Government official responsible for discovering and collecting such debts. \n\n[67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002, as amended at 86 FR 31144, June 11, 2021]",

Such a request must be accompanied by a certification by the requesting agency that the person owes the debt (including the amount) and that the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met. The creditor Agency must also advise USAID of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencement date of the first installment, if a date other than the next established pay period. \n\n(b) Requests to USAID by another Agency to offset salary. Requests for salary offset must be sent to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, United States Agency for International Development, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, USAID Annex, Room 8.80D, Washington, DC 20523-4601.\n\n(c) Processing of the claim by USAID—(1) Incomplete claims. If USAID receives an improperly completed request, the requesting (creditor) Agency will be requested to supply the required information before any salary offset can be taken. \n\n(2) Complete claims. If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) of this section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on the next established pay period. USAID will not review the merits of the creditor Agency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim form. USAID will not assess a handling or any other related charge to cover the cost of its processing the claim. \n\n(d) Employees separating from USAID before a debt to another agency is collected—(1) Employees separating from Government service. If an employee begins separation action before USAID collects the total debt due the creditor Agency, the following actions will be taken: \n\n(i) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor Agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from USAID in accordance with § 213.22; \n\n(ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, USAID will certify to the creditor Agency and the employee the total amount of USAID's collection; and \n\n(iii) If USAID is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund, or other similar payments, it will provide such information to the creditor Agency so that it can file a certified claim against the payments. \n\n(2) Employees who transfer to another Federal agency. If an USAID employee transfers to another Federal agency before USAID collects the total amount due the creditor Agency, USAID will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. It is the responsibility of the creditor Agency to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new employing agency. \n\n[67 FR 47258, July 18, 2002, as amended at 86 FR 31144, June 11, 2021]",

The amount accepted in compromise in such cases will fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal issues involved, considering fully the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary data required to support the Government's claim.

Costs of collection might be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large claims. In determining whether the cost of collection justifies enforced collection of the full amount, USAID may consider the positive effect that enforced collection of the claim could have on the collection of other similar claims;\n\n(e) To assess the merits of a compromise offer, the CFO should obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, that shows the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expense; and\n\n(f) The CFO may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to enforcement, and to compel compliance, when he or she determines that accepting the offer will serve the Agency's enforcement policy adequately, in terms of deterrence and securing compliance (both present and future).\n\n[86 FR 31145, June 11, 2021]",

          "content": "§ 228.01   Definitions.\nAs used in this part, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\nAdvanced developing countries mean those countries that are categorized by the World Bank as upper middle income countries according to their gross national income per capita, except for those countries in which USAID provides assistance. USAID will maintain a list of advanced developing countries primarily based on the most recent World Bank determinations, and will make the list available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310. This list will include determinations made under §  228.17.\n\nAvailable for purchase means for commodities, that the commodity is offered for sale in a country in the authorized principal geographic code at the time of purchase from the supplier, irrespective of the place of manufacture or production, unless it is a prohibited source country. If applicable, the commodity must also be able to be serviced, and, if warrantied, have a valid warranty. For services, available for purchase means the service is offered from a vendor which has complied with nationality and foreign government-owned organization requirements of this regulation, and is otherwise organized in a country in the authorized principal geographic code designated in an implementing instrument. This definition does not apply to procurements under the geographic Code 935, see §  228.03, because that geographic code is for any country or area except for prohibited source countries.\n\nCommission means any payment or allowance by a supplier to any person for the contribution which that person has made to secure the sale or contract for the supplier or which that person makes to securing on a continuing basis similar sales or contracts for the supplier.\n\nCommodities or goods means any material, article, supply, good, or equipment.\n\nCommodity-related services means delivery services and/or incidental services.\n\nCooperating country or recipient country means the country receiving the USAID assistance subject to this part, and includes all the countries receiving assistance under a regional program or project.\n\nDelivery means the transfer to, or for the account of, an importer of the right to possession of a commodity, or, with respect to a commodity-related service, the rendering to, or for the account of, an importer of any such service.\n\nDelivery service means any service customarily performed in a commercial export or import transaction which is necessary to affect a physical transfer of commodities to the cooperating/recipient country. Examples of such services are the following: export packing, local drayage in the source country (including waiting time at the dock), ocean and other freight, loading, heavy lift, wharfage, tollage, switching, dumping and trimming, lighterage, insurance, commodity inspection services, and services of a freight forwarder. “Delivery service” may also include work and materials necessary to meet USAID marking requirements.\n\nDeveloping countries means those countries that are categorized by the World Bank as low or lower middle income economies according to their gross national income per capita, and also includes all countries to which USAID provides assistance. USAID will maintain a list of developing countries primarily based on the most recent World Bank determinations, and will make the list available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310.\n\nFree Port or Bonded Warehouse is a special customs area with favorable customs regulations (or no customs duties and controls for transshipment).\n\nImplementing instrument means a binding relationship established between USAID and an outside party or parties to carry out USAID programs, by authorizing the use of USAID funds and/or nonfinancial resources for the procurement of services or commodities and/or commodity related services. Implementing instruments include specific conditions that apply to each such procurement. Examples of such instruments include contracts, grants, cooperating agreements, and interagency agreements.\n\nIncidental services means services such as installation, erection, maintenance, or upgrading of USAID-financed equipment, or the training of personnel in the maintenance, operation and use of such equipment, or similar services provided for the authorized disposition of such commodities.\n\nLong term lease means, for purposes of subpart B of this part, a single lease of more than 180 calendar days; or repetitive or intermittent leases under a single award within a one-year period, which cumulatively total more than 180 calendar days. A single lease may consist of lease of one or more of the same type of commodity within the same lease term.\n\nMotor vehicles means self-propelled vehicles with passenger carriage capacity, such as highway trucks, passenger cars and buses, motorcycles, scooters, motorized bicycles, ATVs, and utility vehicles. Excluded from this definition are ambulances, snowmobiles, industrial vehicles for materials handling and earthmoving, such as lift trucks, tractors, graders, scrapers, off-the-highway trucks (such as off-road dump trucks), boats, and other vehicles that are not designed for travel at normal road speeds (40 kilometers per hour and above).\n\nMission means the USAID Mission, office or representative in a cooperating/recipient country.\n\nNationality refers to the place of legal organization, ownership, citizenship, or lawful permanent residence (or equivalent immigration status to live and work on a continuing basis) of suppliers of commodities and services.\n\nPharmaceutical means any substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases in humans or animals; any substances (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals; and, any substance intended for use as a component in the above. The term includes drugs, vitamins, oral rehydration salts, biologicals, and some in-vitro diagnostic reagents/test kits; but does not include devices or their components, parts, or accessories. Contraceptives, including condoms, are not included in this definition.\n\nProhibited sources means countries to which assistance is prohibited by the annual appropriations acts of Congress or other statutes, or those subject to other executive branch restrictions, such as applicable sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. USAID maintains a list of prohibited sources, available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310.\n\nRecipients and contractors. Recipient has the same meaning as defined in 22 CFR 226.02, except that it shall include non-U.S. individuals, entities and organizations, as well as subrecipients. Contractors mean those entities which enter into a contract, as the term is defined in 48 CFR part 2, with the U.S. Government, and includes subcontractors.\n\nServices means the performance of identifiable tasks, rather than the delivery of an end item of supply.\n\nSource means the country from which a commodity is shipped to the cooperating/recipient country or the cooperating/recipient country itself if the commodity is located therein at the time of the purchase, irrespective of the place of manufacture or production, unless it is a prohibited source country. Where, however, a commodity is shipped from a free port or bonded warehouse in the form in which received therein, “source” means the country from which the commodity was shipped to the free port or bonded warehouse.\n\nSupplier means any person or organization, governmental or otherwise, who furnishes services, commodities, and/or commodity related services, including delivery or incidental services, financed by USAID.\n\nUnited States means the United States of America, any State(s) of the United States, the District of Columbia, and areas of U.S. associated sovereignty, including commonwealths, territories, and possessions.\n\nUSAID means the United States Agency for International Development or any successor agency, including when applicable, each USAID Mission or office abroad.\n\nUSAID Principal Geographic Code means a USAID code which designates a country, a group of countries, or an otherwise defined area. The USAID principal geographic codes for purposes of procurement are described in §  228.03.\n\n[86 FR 24709, May 10, 2021]",

Financing transportation or driver services means:\n\n(1) The vehicle is independently owned or leased by the hired driver or company;\n\n(2) The vehicle will be maintained by the individual or commercial entity and driven only by the hired driver(s); and\n\n(3) The vehicle is not directly leased, either as a separate line item in the contract separate from the cost of the driver's services, or under a separate contract.\n\n(c) Under section 606(c) of the FAA, USAID cannot finance any pharmaceutical product that is manufactured outside of the United States if the pharmaceutical is covered by a valid U.S. patent, unless the U.S. patent holder expressly authorizes the manufacture of the pharmaceutical. Without such express authorization, the pharmaceutical must be purchased from the U.S. patent holder. In addition, USAID shall not finance non-contraceptive pharmaceuticals without prior written approval as provided in USAID's Automated Directives System Chapter 312. Contraceptives may be financed in accordance with the procedures in ADS 312.",

All waiver decisions will be made solely on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n(a) Waivers to permit procurement outside of Code 937 or 110 must be based on a case by case determination that:\n\n(1) The provision of assistance requires commodities or services of the type that are not produced in and available for purchase in Code 937 or 110;\n\n(2) It is important to permit procurement from a country not specified in Code 937 or 110 to meet unforeseen circumstances; or\n\n(3) To promote efficiency in the use of United States foreign assistance resources, including to avoid impairment of foreign assistance objectives.\n\n(b) Case by case waivers under paragraph (a) of this section may be made on the basis of a commodity or service type or category, rather than processing repeat, individual waivers for an identical or substantially similar commodity or service. Such waivers may be approved on a regional, country, or program basis. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, “produced in and available for purchase in” shall have the same meaning as the definition of “available for purchase” in §  228.01. A waiver under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also be based on the fact that a commodity is not available for purchase in Code 937 or 110 in sufficient, reasonable, and available quantities or sufficient and reasonable quality that is fit for the intended purpose.\n\n(c) A waiver to authorize procurement from outside the United States of agricultural commodities, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals must meet the requirements of §  228.19.\n\n(d) Any individual transaction not exceeding $25,000 (excluding those covered by special procurement rules in §  228.19, and excluding procurements from prohibited sources) does not require a waiver and is hereby authorized.\n\n[86 FR 24710, May 10, 2021]",

A complaint must set forth specifically:\n\n(1) A detailed description, including names and dates, if possible, of the actions of the Peace Corps officials or other persons which resulted in the alleged prohibited discrimination;\n\n(2) The manner in which the Peace Corps' action directly affected the complainant; and\n\n(3) The relief sought.\n\n(b) A complaint that does not conform to the above requirements will nevertheless be deemed to have been received by the OCRD, and the complainant will be notified of the steps necessary to correct the deficiencies of the complaint. The complainant will have 30 days from receipt of notification that the complaint is defective to submit an amended complaint.\n\n(c) The OCRD Director must accept a complaint if the process set forth above has been followed, and the complaint states a covered claim of prohibited discrimination. The OCRD Director may extend the time limits set out above:\n\n(1) When the complainant shows that they were not notified of the time limits and were not otherwise aware of them;\n\n(2) The complainant shows that they were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from submitting the matter in a timely fashion; or\n\n(3) For other reasons considered sufficient by the OCRD Director.\n\n(d) At any time during the complaint procedure, the OCRD Director may dismiss a complaint based on the aggrieved party's failure to prosecute the complaint. However, this action may be taken only after:\n\n(1) The OCRD Director has made a written request, including notice of the proposed dismissal, that the Complainant provide certain information or otherwise proceed with the complaint; and\n\n(2) 30 days have elapsed since the sending of the request.\n\nIf the complaint is rejected for failure to meet one or more of the requirements set out in the procedure outlined in 306.8 or is dismissed, the OCRD Director will inform the aggrieved party in writing of this FAD, advising that the Peace Corps will take no further action.\n\n(e) Upon acceptance of the complaint and receipt of the Counselor's report, the OCRD Director will provide for a prompt impartial investigation of the complaint. The OCRD may employ a Peace Corps employee or external party to conduct the investigation. If a Peace Corps employee is selected to investigate the complaint, the person assigned to investigate the complaint may not occupy a position in the agency which is, directly or indirectly, under the jurisdiction of the head of that part of the agency in which the complaint arose. The investigation will include a review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred, and any other circumstances which may constitute, or appear to constitute, discrimination against the complainant.\n\n(f) Agency officials responsible for providing information relating to the complaint to the investigator will be provided such information about the complaint as they may need in order to respond appropriately. For example, responding agency officials who have a need to know may be provided with information including the identity of the complainant and statements of the alleged discriminatory basis and adverse action.\n\n(g) In cases where sensitive and/or protected information about applicants, trainees, or volunteers (other than the complainant) is requested or involved, agency officials may only disclose such information that is directly relevant to claim(s) being investigated, and must ensure that such information is handled in such a manner that the privacy of the applicants, trainees, or volunteers in question is fully protected, in accordance with the Peace Corps' policy on confidentiality of volunteer information.\n\n(h) Every agency official responsible for providing information relating to the complaint to the investigator may at any point consult the Office of the General Counsel and/or his or her supervisor, unless the supervisor is alleged to have been involved in the conduct that is the subject of the complaint. Agency officials responsible for providing information to the investigator shall only provide information based on personal knowledge, and should not seek to align or conform his or her statement with that of another responding agency official.\n\n(i) The investigator will compile a report of investigation (ROI) and forward the ROI to the OCRD Director. The OCRD Director will arrange for preparation of a draft FAD, which will be in writing, state the reasons underlying the decision, recommend corrective action if and as appropriate, and advise the complainant of the right to appeal the recommended FAD to the Peace Corps Director, or designee. To the extent feasible, this will be completed within 120 days of the filing of the complaint. However, the OCRD Director has discretion to extend the period.\n\n(j) The OCRD Director will issue the proposed FAD to the complainant with a copy of the ROI.\n\n(k) Within ten calendar days of receipt of such proposed FAD, the complainant may submit his or her appeal of the proposed disposition to the Peace Corps Director, or designee.\n\n(l) The Peace Corps Director, or designee, will, to the extent feasible, decide the issue within 45 days of the date of receipt of the appeal. The claimant will be informed in writing of the decision and its basis and advised that it is the FAD regarding the complaint.\n\n(m) Where a complainant does not submit a timely appeal pursuant to (k) above, the OCRD Director will issue the proposed FAD as the FAD.\n\n(n) The OCRD Director will inform relevant management officials as to whether or not prohibited discrimination was found in the FAD.",

When Peace Corps is the creditor agency this notice of intent to offset an employee's salary shall be hand-delivered or sent by certified mail to the most current address that is available. The written notice will state:\n\n(1) That Peace Corps has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, its origin and nature, and the amount of the debt;\n\n(2) The intention of Peace Corps to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full;\n\n(3) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;\n\n(4) An explanation of the Peace Corps' policy concerning interest, penalties and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS (See § 309.5);\n\n(5) The employee's right to inspect and copy all records of the Peace Corps pertaining to the debt claimed or to receive copies of such records if personal inspection is impractical;\n\n(6) The right to a hearing conducted by a hearing official (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, an individual not under the supervision or control of the Peace Corps) with respect to the existence and amount of the debt claimed, or the repayment schedule, so long as a petition is filed by the employee as prescribed;\n\n(7) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Peace Corps) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset.

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee who desires an outside hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the proposed offset schedule must send a request to the office designated in the notice of intent. See § 309.15(a)(8). The request must be received by the designated office not later than 20 calendar days after the date of delivery of the notice as provided in § 309.15(a). The request must be signed by the employee and should identify and explain with reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evidence and witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted from each check, the request should state the objection and the reasons for it. The employee must also specify whether an oral hearing or a review of the documentary evidence is requested. If an oral hearing is desired, the request should explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.\n\n(b) Failure to submit timely. (1) If the employee files a petition for a review after the expiration of the 20 calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the designated office may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of a failure to receive the notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee has actual knowledge of the filing deadline).\n\n(2) An employee waives the right to a review, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with Peace Corps' offset schedule, if the employee fails to file a request for a hearing unless such failure is excused as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(3) If the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified, unless the hearing official determines failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control, his or her appeal will be decided on the basis of the documents then available to the hearing official.\n\n(c) Representation at the hearing. The creditor agency may be represented by a representative of its choice. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her expense.\n\n(d) Review of Peace Corps records related to the debt. (1) An employee who intends to inspect or copy creditor agency records related to the debt in accordance with § 309.15(a)(5), must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be sent within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice.\n\n(2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.\n\n(3) If personal inspection is impractical, copies of such records shall be sent to the employee.\n\n(e) Oral Hearing. (1) If an employee timely files a request for an oral hearing under § 309.16(a), the matter will be conducted by a hearing official not under the supervision or control of Peace Corps.\n\n(2) Procedure. (i) After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.\n\n(ii) An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g. when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication, and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.\n\n(iii) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a decision based upon a review of the available written record.\n\n(iv) The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses who provide testimony will do so under oath or affirmation.\n\n(3) Decision. The written decision shall include:\n\n(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, or the date salary offset will commence, if applicable.\n\n(4) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown (e.g. excused illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing upon the request of the creditor agency representative when good cause is shown.\n\n(5) A hearing official's decision is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 only. It does not supersede the finding by Peace Corps that a debt is owed and does not affect the Government's ability to recoup the debt through alternative collection methods under other appropriate methods.",

The source of salary offset is current disposable pay.\n\n(c) Types of collection—(1) Lump sum payment. Ordinarily debts will be collected by salary offset in one lump sum if possible. However, if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, the collection by salary offset must be made in installment deductions.\n\n(2) Installment deductions. (i) The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If possible, the size of the deduction will be that necessary to liquidate the debt in no more than 1 year. However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to greater amount.\n\n(ii) Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.\n\n(iii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of not greater than the anticipated period of employment.",

The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt and set forth a proposed repayment schedule. Any proposal under this paragraph must be received by the official designated in that notice within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice of intent.\n\n(b) When the Peace Corps is the creditor agency, in response to a timely proposal by the debtor the agency will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset.\n\n(c) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision to file a petition for a review.\n\n(d) If the Peace Corps decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and a designated agency official.",

An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes: \n\n(1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or \n\n(2) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or, \n\n(3) A change in the officer(s), employee(s), or Member(s) contacted to influence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action. \n\n(d) Any person who requests or receives from a person referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section: \n\n(1) A subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal contract; \n\n(2) A subgrant, contract, or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal grant; \n\n(3) A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal loan exceeding $150,000; or, \n\n(4) A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal cooperative agreement, shall file a certification, and a disclosure form, if required, to the next tier above.\n\n(e) All disclosure forms, but not certifications, shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the person referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. That person shall forward all disclosure forms to the agency.\n\n(f) Any certification or disclosure form filed under paragraph (e) of this section shall be treated as a material representation of fact upon which all receiving tiers shall rely. All liability arising from an erroneous representation shall be borne solely by the tier filing that representation and shall not be shared by any tier to which the erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title 31, U.S. Code.\n\n(g) For awards and commitments in process prior to December 23, 1989, but not made before that date, certifications shall be required at award or commitment, covering activities occurring between December 23, 1989, and the date of award or commitment.

Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the BBG in its Freedom of Information Act regulations at 22 CFR Part 503.\n\n(c) Witness fees. Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear and on 28 U.S.C. 1821, as applicable. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel and for attendance in the legal proceeding, plus travel costs.\n\n(d) Payment of fees.

A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of demand letters, Broadcasting Board of Governors will give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, debt referrals to the Department of Justice for litigation, where necessary, can be made within one year of the Board's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When necessary to protect the Government's interests (e.g., to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring) written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this chapter, including immediate referral for litigation. \n\n(b) The initial demand letter will inform the debtor of: The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to request review within the Board; the applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (Subpart D of this regulation) and; the date by which payment is to be made, which normally will not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand delivered. Broadcasting Board of Governors will exercise care to insure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are actually dated. \n\n(c) As appropriate to the circumstances, Broadcasting Board of Governors will include in the demand letters matters relating to alternative methods of payment, the debtor's rights to representation by his respective bargaining unit, policies relating to referral to collection agencies, the Board's intentions relative to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, and, depending on the statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of waiver. \n\n(d) Broadcasting Board of Governors will respond promptly to communications from the debtor and will advise debtors who dispute the debt that they must furnish available evidence to support their contention.",

          "content": "§ 512.10   Collection by administrative offset.\n(a) Collection by administrative offset will be undertaken in accordance with these regulations on all claims which are liquidated and certain in amount, in every instance where the appropriate Board official determines such collection to be feasible and not otherwise prohibited.\n\n(1) For purpose of this section, the term administrative offset has the same meaning as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a)(1). \n\n(2) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made by the Board on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of sound discretion. Broadcasting Board of Governors will consider not only the practicalities of administrative offset, but whether such offset is best suited to protect and further all of the Government's interests. Broadcasting Board of Governors will give consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and is not required to use offset in every instance where there is an available source of funds. Broadcasting Board of Governors will also consider whether offset would tend to substantially disrupt or defeat the purpose of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated. \n\n(b) Before the offset is made, a debtor shall be provided with the following: written notice of the nature and the amount of the debt and the Board's intention to collect by offset; opportunity to inspect and copy Board records pertaining to the debt; opportunity to obtain review within the Board of the determination of indebtedness; and opportunity to enter into written agreement with the Board to repay the debt. Broadcasting Board of Governors may also make requests to other agencies holding funds payable to the debtor, and process requests for offset that are received from other agencies. \n\n(1) Broadcasting Board of Governors will exercise sound judgment in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination will weigh the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor. \n\n(2) In cases where the procedural requirements specified in this paragraph (b) have previously been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority, such as pursuant to an audit allowance, the Board is not required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative offset. \n\n(3) Broadcasting Board of Governors may not initiate administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect the debt. When the debt first accrued is to be determined according to existent law regarding the accrual of debts (e.g., 28 U.S.C. 2415). \n\n(4) Broadcasting Board of Governors is not authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 to use administrative offset with respect to: Debts owed by any State or local Government; debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the tariff laws of the United States; or any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority. \n\n(5) Broadcasting Board of Governors may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraph (b) of this section if failure to take offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later determined not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded 30 days after the Board has notified the debtor in writing that the debt is not owed. Such written notification will be issued within 15 days after the Board has confirmed through a review of its official records that the debt is not owed. \n\n(c) Type of hearing or review: (1) For purposes of this section, whenever Broadcasting Board of Governors is required to afford a hearing or review within the Board, the Board will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when: An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Board to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of veracity; or the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Board determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary type hearing. \n\n(2) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which determinations of indebtedness or waiver rarely involve issues of veracity and the Board has determined that the review of the written record is ordinarily enough to correct prior mistakes. \n\n(3) In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Board will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the written record. \n\n(d) Appropriate use will be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset. Broadcasting Board of Governors will not refuse to initiate administrative offset to collect debts owed the United States, unless the requesting agency has not complied with the applicable provisions of these standards.\n\n(e) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained against the United States shall be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.\n\n(f) Whenever the creditor agency is not the agency which is responsible for making the payment against which offset is sought, the latter agency shall not initiate the requested offset until it has been provided by the creditor agency with an appropriate written certification that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and that full compliance with the provisions of this section has taken place.\n\n(g) When collecting multiple debts by administrative offset, Broadcasting Board of Governors will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying particular attention to the applicable statutes of limitations.",

Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials within the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.\n\n(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall include written statements that:\n\n(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;\n\n(2) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and\n\n(3) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has complied with the requirements of § 512.10 of this part, including any required hearing or review.\n\n(c) Once Broadcasting Board of Governors decides to request offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n(d) If Broadcasting Board of Governors collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(e) This section does not require or authorize the Office of Personnel Management to review the merits of the Broadcasting Board of Governors determination relative to the amount and validity of the debt, its determination on waiver under an applicable statute, or its determination whether to provide an oral hearing.",

However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. If Broadcasting Board of Governors agrees to accept payment in installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of the payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and ability to the debtor to pay. If possible the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within 3 years.\n\n(b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment plan is to be applied among those debts, the Board will follow that designation.

          "content": "§ 512.27   Recovery when paying agency is not creditor agency.\n(a) Format for request for recovery. (1) Upon completion of the procedures prescribed under 5 CFR 550.1104 and its own regulations, the creditor agency shall certify the debt in writing to the paying agency.\n\n(2) The creditor agency shall certify in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt; the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing section 5514 have been approved by OPM.\n\n(3) If collection must be made in installments, the creditor agency must advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of the first installment.\n\n(b) Submitting the request for recovery—(1) Current employees. The creditor agency shall submit the debt claim, agreement, or other instruction on the payment schedule to the employee's paying agency.\n\n(2) Separated employees—(i) Employees who are in the process of separating. If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency will submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in §§ 512.22 and 512.23. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Where the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, it will send a copy of the certified debt claim to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency for pursuing the claim.\n\n(ii) Employees who have already separated. If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the creditor agency may request that monies which are due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other similar funds be administratively offset in order to collect the debt (31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).\n\n(iii) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. If an employee transfers to a position served by a different paying agency subsequent to the creditor agency's debt claim but before complete collection, the paying agency from which the employee separates shall certify the total of collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification will be supplied to the employee, and another to the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer. The original shall be inserted in the employees official personnel folder. The creditor agency shall submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed. The paying agency will then resume collection from the employee's current pay account, and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. The creditor agency will not need to repeat the due process procedure described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101 et seq.” Upon settlement or repayment of the debt all records of the debt will be removed from official personnel records.\n\n(c) Processing the debt claim upon receipt by the paying agency:\n\n(1) Incomplete claims. If the paying agency receives an improperly completed debt certification, it shall return the request with a notice that procedures under 5 CFR 550.1101 et seq. and the creditor agency's own regulations must be completed and a properly completed debt certification form received before action will be taken to effect collection.\n\n(2) Complete claim. If the paying agency receives a properly completed debt form, deductions will begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt form will be given to the debtor along with notice of the date deductions will commence.\n\n(3) The paying agency is not required or authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim.\n\n[52 FR 43897, Nov. 17, 1987, as amended at 55 FR 3051, Jan. 30, 1990]",

Before assessing these charges, Broadcasting Board of Governors will mail or hand deliver a written notice to the debtor. This notice will include a statement of the Board's requirements concerning §§ 512.9 and 512.21.\n\n(b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, using the most current address available to the Board.\n\n(c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury Tax and Loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. However, in cases where the debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks a new agreement, Broadcasting Board of Governors may set a new rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the agreement is executed. Interest will not be assessed on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section.\n\n(d) Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. Calculation of administrative costs shall be based upon actual costs incurred. Administrative costs include costs incurred to obtain credit reports in the case of employee debt or in using a private debt collector in the case of non-employee debt.\n\n(e) Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6% per year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.\n\n(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received shall be applied first to the outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest and third to outstanding principal.\n\n(g) Broadcasting Board of Governors will waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. Broadcasting Board of Governors may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines such action is appropriate. Broadcasting Board of Governors may also waive in whole or in part the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs assessed under this section per the criteria specified in part 103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 103) relating to the compromise of claims or if the Board determines that collection of these charges is not in the best interest of the United States. Waiver under the first sentence of this paragraph is mandatory. Under the second and third sentences, it may be exercised under the following circumstances:\n\n(1) Waiver of interest pending consideration of a request for reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying debt under a permissive statute, and\n\n(2) Waiver of interest where Broadcasting Board of Governors has accepted an installment plan under § 512.12, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the amount of the interest is large enough, in relation to the size of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that the debt will never be repaid.\n\n(h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which collection must be suspended under § 104.2(c)(1) of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 104).",

          "content": "§ 513.110   Coverage.\n(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions.”\n\n(1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.\n\n(i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.\n\n(ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered transaction is:\n\n(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction.\n\n(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction.\n\n(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:\n\n(1) Principal investigators.\n\n(2) Providers of federally-required audit services.\n\n(2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:\n\n(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government; \n\n(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;\n\n(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);\n\n(iv) Federal employment;\n\n(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;\n\n(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and\n\n(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law.\n\n(b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, “Effect of Action,” 513.200, “Debarment or suspension,” sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in 513.110(a). Sections 513.325, “Scope of debarment,” and 513.420, “Scope of suspension,” govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.\n\n(c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.\n\n[53 FR 19179, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 33041, 33045, June 26, 1995]",

To make a request for records a requester must submit a written request to DFC's FOIA Office either by mail to US International Development Finance Corporation, 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527 or electronic mail to foia@dfc.gov. The envelope or subject line should read “Freedom of Information Request” to ensure proper routing. The request is considered received by DFC upon actual receipt by DFC's FOIA Office.\n\n(2) Records about oneself. A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must verify his or her identity by providing a notarized statement or a statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization, stating that the requester is the person he or she claims to be.\n\n(3) Records about a third party. Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, proof of guardianship, or proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). DFC may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DFC personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist DFC in identifying the requested records, such as the project name, contract number, date or date range, country, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact DFC's FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If a requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, DFC will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, DFC's response to the request may be delayed.\n\n(c) Format. Requests may state a preferred format for released records including electronic formats. The records will be provided in the preferred format if the record is readily reproducible in that format. If you do not state a preference, you will receive any released records in the format most convenient to DFC.\n\n(d) Requester information. Requests must include the requester's name and contact information, such as phone number, email address, or mailing address, to assist DFC in communicating with them and providing the released records.\n\n(e) Fees. You should state your willingness to pay fees under these regulations or, alternately, your willingness to pay up to a specified limit. If you believe that you qualify for a partial or total fee waiver under 706.24 you should request a waiver and provide justification as required by 706.24. If your request does not contain a statement of your willingness to pay fees or a request for a fee waiver, DFC will consider your request an agreement to pay up to $25.00 in fees.\n\n[82 FR 20434, May 2, 2017, as amended at 84 FR 37752, Aug. 2, 2019]",

DFC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.",

          "content": "§ 706.21   Types of fees.\n(a) Direct costs are those expenses that DFC expends in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial-use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.\n\n(b) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(c) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 706.33(c) of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(d) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.",

DFC's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.\n\n(b) An Educational Use request is one made on behalf of an educational institution, defined as any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. DFC may request verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.\n\n(1) Example 1. A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.\n\n(2) Example 2. A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.\n\n(3) Example 3. A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.\n\n(c) A Noncommercial Scientific Institution Use request is a request made on behalf of a noncommercial scientific institution, defined as an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.\n\n(d) A News Media Request is a request made by a representative of the news media in that capacity. A representative of the news media is defined as any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, DFC shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.\n\n(e) All other requests include any requests that do not qualify under one of the above categories.",

          "content": "§ 706.23   Fees charged.\n(a) Fees. In responding to FOIA requests, DFC will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 706.24 of this subpart. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, DFC should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees will be charged to all other requests, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. Fees for time spent searching is properly charged even if no responsive records are located or if all responsive records are determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be as follows: Professional—$13.75; and administrative—$7.50.\n\n(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to locate the requested records. Before incurring such costs, DFC will notify the requester and the requester must agree to pay.\n\n(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored at a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section. DFC will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, DFC will provide one copy per request at a cost of $0.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, DFC will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, DFC will charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. Review fees will be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by DFC to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with the re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(b) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) No search fees will be charged for educational use requests, noncommercial scientific use requests, or news media requests as defined in Section 706.22.\n\n(2) Fees charged when DFC exceeds time limits.\n\n(i) When DFC fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.\n\n(ii) If DFC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and DFC provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten days.\n\n(iii) If DFC has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, DFC may charge all applicable fees incurred in processing the request if the following steps are taken:\n\n(A) DFC has provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and\n\n(B) DFC has discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).\n\n(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, DFC will provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(5) If, after deducting free entitlements, the total fee calculated under this section is $25.00 or less, no fee will be charged.\n\n(c) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When DFC determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, DFC will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of fees for search, review, and duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, DFC will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge, and if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) If DFC notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. DFC is not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but DFC estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the processing of the request will be tolled when DFC notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. DFC will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, DFC's time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) DFC's FOIA Office or FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(d) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if DFC chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(e) Charging interest. DFC may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the thirty-first day following the billing date. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by DFC. DFC will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(f) Aggregating requests. If DFC reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, DFC may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. DFC may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, DFC will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.\n\n(g) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section DFC will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When DFC determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. DFC may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within thirty calendar days of the billing date, DFC may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request. DFC may also require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before DFC begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where DFC has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which DFC requires advance payment, DFC's response time will be tolled and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within thirty calendar days after the date of DFC's fee letter, DFC may administratively close the request.\n\n(h) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, DFC will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.",

          "content": "§ 706.24   Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.\n(a) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the interest of the requester.\n\n(b) DFC will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section are satisfied.\n\n(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(2) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall ordinarily be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.\n\n(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, DFC will consider the following factors:\n\n(i) DFC shall identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(ii) If there is a commercial interest, DFC will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. DFC will ordinarily presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(c) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.\n\n(d) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to DFC and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.",

          "content": "§ 706.30   Responsibility for responding to requests.\n(a) Authority to grant or deny requests. The DFC President and CEO or designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records.\n\n(b) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing records responsive to a request, DFC will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, DFC will proceed in one of the following ways:\n\n(1) Consultation. When records originated with DFC, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, DFC will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.\n\n(2) Referral. (i) When DFC believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, DFC will typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if DFC and the originating agency jointly agree that DFC is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n\n(ii) Whenever DFC refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.\n\n(3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if in responding to a request for records on a living third party, DFC locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if DFC locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, DFC should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by DFC.\n\n(c) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, DFC must refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever DFC's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), DFC must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(d) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.\n\n(e) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. DFC may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.",

          "content": "§ 706.31   Timing of responses to requests.\n(a) In general. DFC ordinarily will process requests according to their order of receipt within their appropriate track under paragraph (b) of this section. The response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the FOIA Office, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by DFC. Any time tolled under subparagraph (c) of this section does not count against DFC's response time.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. DFC has a track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Non-expedited requests will be placed into a “simple” or “complex” track based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. DFC will consider the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. DFC will advise the requester into which track the request falls and, when appropriate, will offer requesters the opportunity to narrow or modify the request so that it can be placed in a different track.\n\n(c) Tolling of response time. DFC may toll its response time once to seek clarification of a request in accordance with § 706.11(b) or as needed to resolve fee issues in accordance with §§ 706.22(c) and 706.23(d) of this part. The response time will resume upon DFC's receipt of the requester's clarification or upon resolution of the fee issue.\n\n(d) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limits for processing cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances” as defined in the FOIA, and DFC extends the time limits on that basis, DFC will notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which DFC estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the requester will be provided an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. DFC will make its FOIA Office and its FOIA Public Liaison available for this purpose and will notify the requester of the availability of the Office of Government Services (OGIS) dispute resolution services.\n\n(e) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, DFC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. DFC will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.\n\n(f) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;\n\n(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.\n\n(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the tDFC. DFC may waive the formal certification requirement in its administrative discretion.\n\n(4) DFC shall notify the requester within ten calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If DFC denies expedited processing, any appeal of that decision which complies with the procedures set forth in § 706.34 of this subpart shall be acted on expeditiously.",

To the extent practicable, DFC will communicate electronically with requesters who have access to the internet.\n\n(b) Acknowledgments of requests. If a request will take longer than ten days to process, DFC will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that assigns the request an individualized tracking number. The letter will include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of requests.\n\n(c) Grants of requests. DFC will notify the requester in writing if it makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part. The notice will inform the requester of any fees charged under § 706.22 of this part and of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance. DFC will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.\n\n(d) Adverse determinations of requests. DFC will notify the requester in writing if it makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(e) Content of denial letter. The denial letter will be signed by the person responsible for the denial, and will include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemptions applied;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, for example, by providing the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimation is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;\n\n(4) A brief description of the types of information withheld and the reasons for doing so. A description and explanation are not required if providing it would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;\n\n(5) A statement that the denial may be appealed under Section 706.34(a) of this subpart, and a description of the appeal requirements;\n\n(6) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from DFC's FOIA Public Liaison and dispute resolution services offered by OGIS; and\n\n(7) Notice of any fees charged under § 706.23 of this part.\n\n(f) Markings on released documents. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. If technically feasible, the location of the information deleted will be indicated on the record.\n\n(g) Notice of record exclusions. (1) In the event that DFC identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the agency will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy, to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) DFC will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.",

          "content": "§ 706.33   Confidential commercial information.\n(a) Definitions—(1) Confidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by the agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Exemption 4 protects certain:\n\n(i) Trade secrets as defined under FOIA law; or\n\n(ii) Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential as defined under FOIA law.\n\n(2) Submitter means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information to the Federal government, directly or indirectly.\n\n(b) Designation of confidential commercial information. All submitters may designate, by appropriate markings, any portions of their submissions that they consider to be protected from disclosure under the FOIA. These markings will be considered by DFC in responding to a FOIA request but such markings (or the absence of such markings) will not be dispositive as to whether the marked information is ultimately released. Unless otherwise requested and approved these markings will be considered no longer applicable ten years after submission or five years after the close of the associated project, whichever is later.\n\n(c) When notice to submitters is required. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, DFC's FOIA Office will use reasonable efforts to notify a submitter in writing whenever:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) DFC has reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.\n\n(2) This notification will describe the nature and scope of the request, advise the submitter of its right to submit written objections in response to the request, and provide a reasonable time for response. The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.\n\n(d) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:\n\n(1) DFC determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, DFC will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure.\n\n(1) DFC will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above.\n\n(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide DFC with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In setting forth such grounds, the submitter should explain the basis of its belief that the nondisclosure of any item of information requested is mandated or permitted by law. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as a basis for nondisclosure, the submitter shall explain why the information is considered a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential as defined under FOIA law.\n\n(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. DFC is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(4) The period for providing DFC with objections to disclosure of information may be extended by DFC upon receipt of a written request for an extension from the submitter. Such written request shall set forth the date upon which any objections are expected to be completed and shall provide reasonable justification for the extension. In its discretion, DFC may permit more than one extension.\n\n(f) Analysis of objections. DFC will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondislosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. If DFC decides to disclosure information over the objection of a submitter, DFC will notify the submitter of its determination at least five working days prior to release of the information. The notification will include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed, or a copy thereof; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.\n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a FOIA lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, DFC will promptly notify the submitter.\n\n(i) Requester notification. DFC will notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.",

A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to DFC's Vice President and General Counsel at foia@dfc.gov or 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in Section 706.06(c) of this subpart. The requester must make the appeal in writing and it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within ninety calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify DFC's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. The requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. DFC's Vice President and General Counsel or his/her designee will render a written decision within twenty working days after the date of DFC's receipt of the appeal, unless an extension of up to ten working days is deemed necessary due to unusual circumstances. The requester will be notified in writing of any extension.\n\n(c) Decisions on appeals. A decision that upholds the initial determination will contain a written statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied, and will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and the ability to request dispute resolution from the Office of Government Information Services. If an initial determination is remanded or modified on appeal the requester will be notified in writing. DFC's FOIA Office will then process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester. If an appeal is granted in whole or in part, the information will be made available promptly, provided the requirements of Section 706.23 regarding payment of fees are satisfied.\n\n(d) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If DFC agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n(e) When appeal is required. Before seeking court review, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.\n\n[82 FR 20434, May 2, 2017, as amended at 84 FR 37752, Aug. 2, 2019]",

An individual may request access to or copies of records maintained by DFC that are retrieved by an individual's personal identifier. To make a request for records a requester must submit a written request to the Director of Human Resources Management either by mail or delivery to US International Development Finance Corporation, 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527 or electronic mail to privacy@dfc.gov. The envelope or subject line should read “Privacy Act Request” to ensure proper routing. Access to records maintained by DFC will be provided only by appointment. No officer or employee of DFC shall provide an individual with any records under this part until a written request as described in paragraph (b) of this section is provided and the identity of the individual is verified as described in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(b) Information to include. All requests under this section must:\n\n(1) Be in writing and be signed by the requester. Unless the requester is a current officer or employee of DFC, the letter must also be duly acknowledged before a notary public or other authorized public official or signed under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization;\n\n(2) Provide information sufficient to verify the identity of the requester, including the requester's full name, current address, date of birth, place of birth, or the system of record identification name or number. Also include a clearly legible copy of a valid form of identification. If the request is being made by a parent or guardian on behalf of another, also include the same information for the individual who is the subject of the request along with a court order, birth certificate, or similar document proving the guardianship. DFC will review the sufficiency of identity evidence under paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(3) Provide information sufficient to accurately identify the records or information so that DFC staff can locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. At minimum this should include the full name, the system of record identification name, or the system identification number for the individual who is the subject of the records. Provision of a social security number is optional. If possible, also include a description of the records as well as providing a record creation time range and the name of the systems that should be searched. A description of DFC's system of records can be located in the “Privacy Act Compilation” published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. Each system of records is also published in the Federal Register;\n\n(4) Specify whether the individual wishes access to or copies of the information pertaining to him.

A request that does not include an agreement to pay fees will be considered an agreement to pay fees up to $25.00.\n\n(c) Verification of identity. Prior to providing any requested information about an individual, the Director of Human Resources Management shall verify the identity of the individual. If the requester is acting as the guardian of the individual who is the subject of the records, the Director will also verify the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, the relationship between the requester and the subject individual, and that the requester is acting on behalf of the subject individual. In order to verify identity, the Director shall require the individual to provide reasonable proof of identity such as a valid driver's license, identification card, passport, employee identification card, or any other identifying information. The Director shall deny any request where she determines, at her sole discretion, that the evidence offered to verify the identity of an individual is insufficient to conclusively establish the identity of the individual.\n\n(d) Release of records. Originals and record copies will not be released from the files of DFC. Individuals will not be permitted to disturb any record files or to remove records from designated place of examination. If copies were requested in the request letter, copies will be furnished upon payment of the fees prescribed in § 707.27.\n\n(e) Denial of request. If the Director of Human Resources Management declines any request submitted under this section, the denial will be made in writing and contain a brief description of the denial. Denials include a determination that an individual has not provided adequate evidence to verify identity under paragraph (c) of this section, a determination that the record cannot be located, and a withholding of a record in whole or in part.

The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors: \n\n(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing. \n\n(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing. \n\n(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. \n\n(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part. \n\n(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part. \n\n(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing. \n\n(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment. \n\n(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution. \n\n(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you. \n\n(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization. \n\n(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing. \n\n(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence. \n\n(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense. \n\n(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner. \n\n(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official. \n\n(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred. \n\n(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment. \n\n(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment. \n\n(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.",

Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, an employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who:\n\n(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the employee's agency;\n\n(2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the employee's agency;\n\n(3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty; or\n\n(4) Appears to be offering the gift with the hope or expectation of obtaining advantage or preferment in dealing with the U.S. Government for any purpose.\n\n(b) Acceptance permitted. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to:\n\n(1) Gifts, gratuities, favors, entertainments, loans, or any other thing of monetary value received on account of close family or personal relationships when the circumstances make it clear that it is that relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned which is the motivating factor;\n\n(2) Acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans;\n\n(3) Acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal intrinsic value;\n\n(4) Acceptance of rates and discounts offered to employees as a class.\n\n(c) Acceptance permitted for IDCA employees. For IDCA employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to: Acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour where an employee may properly be in attendance.\n\n(d) Acceptance permitted for AID employees. For AID employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the following situations:\n\n(1) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment of nominal value on infrequent occasions offered in the ordinary course of luncheons, dinners, or other meetings and gatherings hosted by foreign governments or agencies and officials thereof, embassies, and international organizations, where the primary purpose of the function is representational or social, rather than the transaction of business. Where the primary purpose of the function is the transaction of business, acceptance is not permitted, except if there is justification and reporting in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(2) Participation in widely attended lunches, dinners, and similar gatherings sponsored by industrial, technical, and professional associations for the discussion of matters of mutual interest to Government and industry. \n\n(3) Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment in the unusual situation where the employee, by virtue of the location of the person, firm, corporation, or other entity, or the regulations governing its dining facilities, finds it inconvenient or impracticable not to accept the offer. Each case of acceptance shall be reported in accordance with the requirement of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. In no other case shall employees accept food, refreshments, or entertainment from private corporations, entities, firms, or individual contractors at occasions which are other than widely attended functions whose purposes are unrelated to Agency business.\n\n(4) In exceptional circumstances where acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment is not authorized by paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, but where, in the judgment of the individual concerned, the Government's interest would be served by such acceptance directly or indirectly from any foreign government, agency, or official thereof or a private person, firm, corporation, or other entity which is engaged or is endeavoring to engage in business transactions of any sort with AID, an employee may accept the offer: Provided, That a report of the circumstances, together with the employee's statement as to how the Government's interests were served, will be made within 48 hours to the employee's supervisor, or, if the employee is serving abroad, or on temporary duty abroad, to the Mission Director.\n\n(e) Gifts to superiors. An employee shall for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than the employee (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.\n\n(f) Neither this section nor § 1203.735-204 precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on the employee's behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.",

The exemption applies to the financial interests held directly by an employee, by the employee's spouse or minor child whether individually or jointly with the employee, or by an employee and any partner or partners as joint assets of the partnership:\n\n(1) Investments in State and local government bonds; and stocks, bonds, or policies in a mutual fund, investment company, bank or insurance company, provided that in the case of a mutual fund, investment company, or bank, the fair value of such stock or bond holding does not exceed one percent of the value of the reported assets of the mutual fund, investment company, or bank. In the case of a mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where the fund or company specializes in a particular industry or commodity.\n\n(2) Interest in an investment club or other group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities: Provided, That the fair value of the interest involved does not exceed $10,000 and that the interest does not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club or group. Where an employee covered by this exemption is a member of a group organized for the purpose of investing in equity or debt securities, the interest of the employee in any enterprise in which the group holds securities shall be based upon the employee's equity share of the holdings of the group in that enterprise.\n\n(3) If an employee, or the employee's spouse or minor child has a present beneficial interest or a vested remainder interest under a trust, the ownership of stocks, bonds, or other corporate securities under the trust will be exempt to the same extent as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for the direct ownership of such securities. The ownership of bonds other than corporate bonds, or of shares in a mutual fund or regulated investment company, under the trust will be equally exempt and to the same extent as under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. \n\n(4) If an employee is an officer, director, trustee, or employee of an educational institution, or if the employee is negotiating for, or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment with such an institution, a direct financial interest which the institution has in any matter will not itself be exempt, but any financial interest that the institution may have in the matter through its holdings of securities issued by business entities will be exempt: Provided, The employee is not serving as a member of the investment committee of the institution or is not otherwise advising it on its investment portfolio.\n\n(5) An employee may continue to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health or accident insurance plan, or other employee welfare or benefit plan that is maintained by a business or nonprofit organization by which the employee was formerly employed. Such financial interest in that organization will be exempt, except to the extent that the welfare or benefit plan is a profit-sharing or stock-bonus plan and the employee's financial interest thereunder exceeds $10,000. This exemption extends also to any financial interests that the organization may have in other business activities.\n\n(d) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary, except in those matters in which the employee has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of the employee's official responsibility, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(b): Provided, The head of the employee's division approves in writing.",

For the purpose of this section, the term private organization denotes any group of persons or associations organized for any purpose whatever, except an organization established by the Government of the United States, or officially participated in by IDCA.\n\n(b) Participation in activities of employee organizations. An employee may join or refrain from joining employee organizations or associations without interference, coercion, restraint, or fear of discrimination or reprisal.\n\n(c) Participation in activities of private organizations. In participating in the program and activities of any private organization, an employee shall make clear that the employee's agency has no official connection with such organization and does not necessarily sponsor or sanction the viewpoints which it may express. \n\n(d) Legal restrictions on membership in certain organizations. An employee shall not have membership in any organization that advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of Government in the United States, knowing that such organization so advocates (5 U.S.C. 7311, 18 U.S.C. 1918).\n\n(e) Private organizations concerned with foreign policy or other matters of concern to agencies. (1) Limitation on participation. When a private organization is concerned primarily with foreign policy or international relations or other matters of concern to an employee's agency, an employee shall limit connection therewith as follows: Unless specifically permitted to do so, the employee may not serve as advisor, officer, director, teacher, sponsor, committee chairman, or in any other official capacity or permit the employee's name to be used on a letterhead, in a publication, in an announcement or news story, or at a public meeting, regardless of whether the employee's official title or connection is mentioned. The provisions of this section are not intended to prohibit the normal and active participation of an employee in professional organizations such as the American Political Science Association, the American Economic Association, the American Foreign Service Association, and similar organizations, since such participation is in the interest of both the employee and the Government. Employees are expected, however, to exercise discretion in such activities and are held personally accountable for any improper use of their relationship with IDCA.\n\n(2) Request for special permission. Special permission to assume or continue a connection prohibited by paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be granted in cases where the public interest will not be adversely affected. To request such permission, or to determine whether the provisions are applicable to a particular case, the employee shall address a memorandum setting forth all of the circumstances to the appropriate officer. The appropriate officer for IDCA is the Assistant Director for Administration. \n\n(3) Application to senior officers. Because of the prominence resulting from their official positions, chiefs of mission and other senior officers should recognize the particular bearing of the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon their activities. They should restrict association with any organizations involving foreign nations and the United States to simple membership and should not accept even honorary office in such organizations except with the specific prior approval as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. \n\n(f) Private organizations not concerned with foreign policy. When the purpose and program of the organization do not fall primarily within the field of foreign policy or international relations, the employee's activity is limited only to the following extent: \n\n(1) The employee's official title or connection may be used to identify the employee, as in a civic association election, but may not be used on a letterhead, in a publication, or otherwise so as to employ the prestige of the U.S. Government to enhance that of the organization or to imply official sponsorship.\n\n(2) When the employee is a representative of an association consisting of IDCA employees, or of a group of such employees, the employee's connection with the agency may be freely used so long as there is no implication of official sponsorship beyond that which may have been officially approved.\n\n(g) Political activities abroad. A U.S. citizen employee shall not engage in any form of political activity in any foreign country.\n\n(h) Activities relating to U.S. politics. The law (5 U.S.C. 7324, formerly the Hatch Act) provides in summary that it is unlawful for any Federal employee of the executive branch to use the employee's official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof, or to take any active part in political management or in political campaigns. These restrictions do not in any way affect the right of a Federal employee (1) to vote as the employee chooses; (2) to express personal political opinions, except as part of a campaign; (3) to make or refrain from making contributions to political organizations, provided contributions are not made in a Federal building or to another Federal officer or employee (see 18 U.S.C. 602, 603, 607, and 608); (4) to participate in local, nonpartisan activities.",

A principal officer in answer to a letter of inquiry from outside the U.S. Government concerning a former employee assigned to the post, may state the length of time the person was employed at the post and the fact that the former employee performed duties in a satisfactory manner, if such is the case.

An employee may make a personal recommendation in connection with the employment of any person, including present or former employees, their spouses and/or members of their families, except for employment in a position of trust or profit under the government of the country to which the employee is accredited or assigned (22 U.S.C. 806(b)): Provided, That the employee does not divulge any information concerning the person derived from official sources. When a letter of introduction or recommendation is written by an employee, precautionary measures should be taken to prevent its being construed as official correspondence and used by an unscrupulous individual to impress American or foreign officials. Accordingly, official stationery should not be used for this purpose. The letter may, however, show the recommending employee's status as an employee of the U. S. Government.

The superior will thereupon relieve the employee of duty and responsibility in the matter.\n\n(2) In foreign posts, it may be impossible or highly impracticable for an employee, who has a disqualifying financial interest, to assign the matter for official action to anyone other than a subordinate. In this event, the employee must instruct the subordinate to report fully and directly to the immediate superior to whom the employee himself or herself would normally report. The employee must concurrently direct such subordinate to take such action as may be appropriate in the matter, and without thereafter revealing to the disqualified employee in any way any aspect of the particular matter.\n\n(b) Nothing herein precludes the employee from disposing of such disqualifying financial interest, thereby wholly eliminating the conflict of interest. In some circumstances, where the employee may not obtain an exception under § 1203.735-217, or may not disqualify himself or herself and refer or assign the matter to another employee, the performance of duty may even require divestiture.\n\n(c) Where a supervisor has reason to believe that a subordinate employee may have a conflicting financial interest, the supervisor should discuss the matter with the employee. If the supervisor finds that a conflict of interest does exist, the supervisor must relieve the subordinate employee of duty and responsibility in the particular matter.\n\n(d) The obligation to avoid conflicts of interest is upon each employee. It is a continuing obligation calling for alert vigilance.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, if an employee's holdings rise in value above the amount exempted by § 1203.735-205(c), then the statutory and regulation prohibitions apply in a conflict of interest situation.",

A day of the week, excluding Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holidays.\n\nCalendar days. Every day within a month, including Saturday, Sunday, and legal public holidays. Unless identified as a “business day” or “work day,” all timeframes and days noted in this part shall be calculated in calendar days.\n\nChief FOIA Officer. A designated MCC employee who is a senior official, at the Assistant Secretary or equivalent level who, subject to the authority of the head of the agency, shall have agency wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA. In addition, the Chief FOIA Officer shall monitor implementation of the FOIA throughout MCC and keep the head of the agency, the chief legal officer of the agency, and the Attorney General appropriately informed of the agency's performance in implementing the FOIA; recommend to the head of the agency such adjustments to MCC's practices, policies, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to improve its implementation of the FOIA; facilitate public understanding of the purposes of the statutory exemptions of the FOIA; offer training to MCC staff regarding their responsibilities under the FOIA, serve as the primary agency liaison with the Office of Government Information Services and the Office of Information policy; and designate one (1) or more FOIA Public Liaisons. The Chief FOIA Officer shall review, not less frequently than annually, all aspects of the administration of the FOIA by MCC to ensure compliance with the requirements of the FOIA, including—agency regulations; disclosure of records; assessment of fees and determination of eligibility for fee waivers; timely processing of requests for information; the use of exemptions; and dispute resolution services with the assistance of the Office of Government Information Services or the FOIA Public Liaison.\n\nCommercial requester. Any person making a request for information for a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.\n\nComplex request. A FOIA request that MCC anticipates will involve a voluminous amount of material to review or will be time-consuming to process.\n\nConfidential commercial information. Records provided to the government that contain material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA and disclosure of such records could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.\n\nConsultation. When MCC locates a record that contains information of interest to another agency, MCC shall ask the interested agency for their views on disclosing the records before any final determination is made.\n\nDirect costs. Expenditures actually incurred by MCC for searching, duplicating, and in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing records in order to respond to a FOIA request.\n\nDiscretionary disclosure. The release of or portions of records to a FOIA requester that could be withheld by MCC under one or more of the FOIA exemptions.\n\nDuplication. The process of making a copy of a record in order to respond to a FOIA request, including but not limited to paper copies, microfilm, audio-video materials, and computer diskettes or other electronic copies.\n\nDuplication fees. The estimated direct costs of making a copy of a record in order to respond to a FOIA request.\n\nEducational institution. Any school or institution that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution.\n\nEducational requester. A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.\n\nExemptions. Certain categories of information that are not required to be released in response to a FOIA request because release would be harmful to governmental or private interests.\n\nFee waiver. The waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.\n\nFOIA Appeals Officer. The MCC employee who is responsible for conducting an independent review of the initial determination of the FOIA request after the requester has requested an administrative appeal.\n\nFOIA Public Liaison. The MCC employee who is responsible for assisting in the resolution of disputes in response to FOIA requests.\n\nFOIA Program Officer. The MCC employee who receives and processes requests within the MCC FOIA Office.\n\nNon-commercial scientific institution. An institution that does not operate on a commercial basis, but operates solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research and the results of the scientific research are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\nRecord. Any item, collection, or grouping of information maintained by MCC in any form or format, including an electronic copy. A “record” can potentially constitute an entire document, a single page of a multipage document, an individual paragraph of a document, or an email within an email chain.\n\nReferral. When an agency locates a record that originated with, or is of otherwise primary interest to another agency, it will forward that record to the other agency to process the record and to provide the final determination directly to the requester.\n\nRepresentative of the news media. Any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.\n\nReview. The process of examining a record to determine whether all or part of the record may be released or withheld, and includes redacting or otherwise processing the record for disclosure to a requester. The review process does not include time spent resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions to a record. The review process also does not include time spent reviewing records at the administrative appeal level unless, MCC determines that the exemption under which it withheld records does not apply and the records are reviewed again to determine whether a different exemption may apply.\n\nRequester category. One of the three categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication, including commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters.\n\nSearch. The time spent locating records that may be responsive to a request, manually or by electronic means, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of responsive material within a record.\n\nSearch fees. Estimated direct costs of the time spent locating records by either manual or electronic means.\n\nSubmitter. Any person or entity who provides information directly or indirectly to MCC. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.",

The twenty (20) business day period shall not be tolled except that MCC may make one request to the requester for information and toll the twenty (20) business day period while it is awaiting receipt of the information, or the twenty (20) business day period may be tolled if it is necessary to clarify issues regarding fees with the requester.\n\n(b) Unusual circumstances. If MCC cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances” as defined in the FOIA and MCC extends the time limit on that basis, MCC will, before expiration of the twenty (20) business day period, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which MCC estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten (10) business days, MCC will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. MCC must make its designated FOIA Program Officer or FOIA Public Liaison available for this purpose. To aid the requester, the MCC FOIA Public Liaison shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and MCC, and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.\n\n(c) Aggregating requests. MCC may aggregate requests where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.\n\n(d) Multitrack processing. MCC may use multitrack processing in responding to requests. This process entails separating simple requests that require rather limited review from more lengthy and complex requests. Requests in each track are then processed in their respective track. The FOIA Program Officer may provide requesters in the slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to decrease the processing time required. The FOIA Program Officer may provide the opportunity to limit the scope of the request by contacting the requester by letter, email, or telephone.\n\n(e) Expedited processing of requests. The FOIA Program Officer must determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt. Requests will receive expedited processing if one of the following criteria are met:\n\n(1) The requester can establish that failure to receive the records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(2) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and can demonstrate that an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity exists; or\n\n(3) As determined by the Chief FOIA Officer.\n\n(f) Written expedited requests. A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a written statement explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. This statement must be certified to be true and correct. The MCC Chief FOIA Officer may waive the formal certification requirement.",

The requester must submit a written notice of appeal and it must be postmarked or, in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted within ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the determination that is being appealed and the assigned tracking number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(b) Appeals address. Requesters can submit appeals by mail by addressing it to Millennium Challenge Corporation, Attn.: FOIA Appeals Officer, 1099 14th St. NW, Washington, DC 20005 or online at FOIA@mcc.gov.\n\n(c) Adjudication of appeals. The MCC FOIA Appeals Officer will adjudicate the appeal within twenty (20) business days after the receipt of such appeal. An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of the subject of litigation. On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the MCC FOIA Appeals Officer must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.\n\n(d) Final agency determinations. The FOIA Appeals Officer shall issue a final written determination, stating the basis for the decision, within twenty (20) business days after receipt of a notice of appeal. Any decision that upholds MCC's determination in whole or in part must contain a statement that identifies the reason(s) for the decision, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the OGIS of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Chief FOIA Officer's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the FOIA Appeals Officer will notify the requester of the determination in writing. MCC will then further process the request in accordance with the appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.\n\n(e) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If MCC agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, MCC will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n(f) When an appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of MCC's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.",

          "content": "§ 1304.11   Fees.\n(a) General information. (1) MCC's fee provisions are governed by the FOIA and by the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform FOIA Fee Schedule and Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes the following categories of requesters:\n\n(i) Commercial use;\n\n(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions;\n\n(iii) Representative of the news media; and\n\n(iv) All other requesters.\n\n(2) Fees will be assessed pursuant to the category of requester and detailed in paragraph (b) of this section. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, MCC may contact a requester for additional information. MCC will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. MCC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees to the Treasury of the United States. All fee information is available at www.mcc.gov/resources/foia.\n\n(b) Charging fees. Because the fee amounts provided already account for the direct costs associated with the given fee type, MCC will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section. In responding to FOIA requests, MCC shall charge fees for the following unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted:\n\n(1) Search time fees. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(i) Requests made by education institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search time fees. Search time fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions identified in this section. MCC may properly charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located if it is determined that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any searches that require the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.\n\n(iii) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at the Federal Records Centers operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Range Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Duplication fees. Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions in this section. MCC shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by MCC in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, MCC shall provide one copy per request and charge fees calculated per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, MCC shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall be charged direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, MCC shall charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal state of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. If a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with MCC's subsequent review following the administrative appeal of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.\n\n(c) Restrictions on charging fees. The following restrictions shall apply to MCC FOIA requests:\n\n(1) If MCC fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits to respond to a request, MCC may not charge fees, except as described in paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section;\n\n(2) If MCC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten (10) calendar days;\n\n(3) If MCC has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than five-thousand (5,000) pages are necessary to respond to the request, MCC may charge search time fees or duplication fees where applicable, if MCC has provided timely written notice of the unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and has discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made a minimum of three (3) good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request;\n\n(4) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order; and\n\n(5) No search time or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(d) Fee exceptions. Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use, MCC shall provide without charge:\n\n(1) The first one-hundred (100) pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(2) The first two (2) hours of search time. When, after deducting the first one-hundred (100) free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two (2) hours of search time, a total fee calculated under this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When MCC determines that the fees to be assessed will exceed $25.00, the requester shall be notified of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including the breakdown of the fees for search time, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, MCC shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is not a commercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory requirements of one-hundred (100) pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search time fees, two (2) hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits, in writing, to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a requester who is not a commercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. MCC is not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, and MCC estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, MCC shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. MCC shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) The FOIA Program Officer will assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Waiver or reduction of fees. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge below that listed in this section based upon information provided by a requester or otherwise made known to the Chief FOIA Officer that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and is not primarily for commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case by case basis. Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted to those records. In order to determine whether the fee waiver requirement is met, the Chief FOIA Officer shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;\n\n(2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) The significance of the contribution to public understanding.\n\n(g) Fees pending a waiver request. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the agency and should address the criteria referenced in this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.\n\n(h) Types of requesters. There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The following specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:\n\n(1) Commercial requesters shall be charged the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records;\n\n(2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters shall be charged for document duplication only and the first one-hundred (100) pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge;\n\n(3) Representative of the news media requesters shall be charged for document duplication costs only, except that the first one-hundred (100) pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge; and\n\n(4) All other requesters who do not fall into any of the categories in paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section shall be charged fees which recover the full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing records if that total costs exceeds $25.00, except that the first one-hundred (100) pages of duplication and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be charged.\n\n(i) Charges for unsuccessful searches. If the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees may be charged.\n\n(j) Charges for other services. Although MCC is not required to provide special services, if it chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(k) Charging interest. MCC may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received. MCC shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(l) Aggregating requests. The requester or a group of requesters may not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the FOIA Program Officer reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of fees, the FOIA Program Officer may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. MCC may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a thirty (30) calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, MCC will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.\n\n(m) Advance payment of fees. (1) MCC may require an advanced payment of fees if the requestor previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA Program Officer determines the total fee will exceed $250.00. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in § 1304.5 shall not be deemed to begin until the requester has paid the assessed fees.\n\n(2) In cases in which MCC requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the fee determination, the request will be closed. Where it is anticipated that the cost of providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 but falls below $250.00 after the free duplication and search time has been calculated, MCC may, in its discretion may require either an advance deposit of the entire estimated charges or written confirmation of the requester's willingness to pay such charges.\n\n(3) Where the requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within thirty (30) calendar days of the billing date, MCC may require the requester to pay the full amount due plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and/or require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of the anticipated fee before MCC begins a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If MCC has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, MCC may require that the requester provide proof of identity.",

(i) The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay.

However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, except as provided by other laws or regulations or unless the employee has agreed in writing to a greater amount.\n\n(ii) Installment payments of less than $50 per pay period will be accepted only in unusual circumstances such as when that amount exceeds 15% of disposable pay.\n\n(iii) Installment deductions should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim within three years and must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment.",

The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall grant the request upon the determination that the testimony or documents appear to be necessary to the matters under investigation and the request describes with sufficient particularity the documents sought. Service of an approved subpoena is the responsibility of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. The subpoena shall show on its face the name and address of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued.\n\n(e) Any person served with a subpoena who does not intend to comply, shall, within five (5) days after the date of service of the subpoena upon such person, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. A copy of any petition to revoke a subpoena shall be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued. Such petition to revoke, if made prior to the hearing, and a written statement of service, shall be filed with the Regional Director, who may refer the petition to the Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, for ruling. A petition to revoke a subpoena filed during the hearing, and a written statement of service, shall be filed with the appropriate presiding official(s). The Regional Director, or the appropriate presiding official(s) will, as a matter of course, cause a copy of the petition to revoke to be served on the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, but shall not be deemed to assume responsibility for such service. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall revoke the subpoena if the evidence the production of which is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings, or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence the production of which is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is invalid. The Board, General Counsel, Administrative Law Judge, Regional Director, Hearing Officer, or any other employee of the Board designated by the Board, as appropriate, shall make a simple statement of procedural or other ground for the ruling on the petition to revoke. The petition to revoke, any answer thereto, and any ruling thereon shall not become part of the official record except upon the request of the party aggrieved by the ruling.\n\n(f) Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued, upon the request of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, the General Counsel shall, on behalf of such party, institute proceedings in the appropriate district court for the enforcement thereof, unless, in the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena would be inconsistent with law and the policies of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The General Counsel shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the same before the court thereafter.",

USADF will assess interest on all delinquent debts, unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.\n\n(1) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the payment due date established in the initial notice to the debtor, or as otherwise provided by law. USADF shall charge an annual rate of interest that is equal to the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 unless a different rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. USADF will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.\n\n(2) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is executed.\n\n(3) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costs or late payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalty charges that had been waived under the defaulted agreement may be reinstated and added to the debt principal under any new agreement and interest may be charged on the entire amount of the debt.\n\n(b) Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. The costs of USADF's administrative processing of overdue debts, including charges assessed by the Department of Treasury in cross-servicing the debts based on either actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts. These costs include both direct and indirect costs.\n\n(c) Penalties. Penalty charges will be assessed at 6 percent a year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days.\n\n(d) Allocation of payments. A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first towards outstanding administrative costs, penalty assessments, accrued interest and then towards the outstanding debt principal.\n\n(e) Waivers. (1) USADF will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on any portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment charges begin to accrue. This 30 day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis where the Agency determines that such action is in the best interest of the Government.\n\n(2) USADF may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty or administrative costs, where it determines that:\n\n(i) Waiver is justified under the criteria of subpart D; or\n\n(ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the United States.\n\n(3) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges or administrative costs may be made at any time.",

The request must be filed in writing and signed by the employee. It must be received by the Agency within 15 days of the employee's receipt of the notification of proposed deduction. Late request for a hearing may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay in filing the request was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.\n\n(4) The Agency will make hearing arrangements that are consistent with law and regulations.

Where the hearing official determines that the validity of the debt turns on an issue of veracity or credibility which cannot be resolved through a review of documentary evidence, the hearing official at his discretion may afford the debtor an opportunity for an oral hearing. An oral hearing will consist of an informal conference before a hearing official in which the employee and the Agency may present evidence, witnesses and arguments. The employee may be represented by an individual of his/her choosing.

A creditor agency will be required to supply USADF with all the required information prior to any salary offset from the employee's current pay account.\n\n(2) Complete claims. If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) of this section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on the next established pay period.

If an USADF employee transfers to another Federal agency before USADF collects the total amount due the creditor agency, USADF will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt.

During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents. \n\n(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions. \n\n(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.",

          "content": "§ 1508.860   What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?\nThis section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors: \n\n(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing. \n\n(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing. \n\n(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. \n\n(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part. \n\n(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part. \n\n(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing. \n\n(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment. \n\n(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution. \n\n(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you. \n\n(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization. \n\n(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing. \n\n(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence. \n\n(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense. \n\n(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner. \n\n(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official. \n\n(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred. \n\n(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment. \n\n(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment. \n\n(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.",

Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment. \n\n(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 1508.860.

A recipient so prohibited is suspended, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation for procurement contracts (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4) and the common rule, Government-wide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement), that implements Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689. Suspension of a recipient is a distinct and separate action from suspension of an award or suspension of payments under an award.",
