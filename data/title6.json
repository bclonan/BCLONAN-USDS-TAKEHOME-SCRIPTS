Additionally, DHS has additional policies and procedures relevant to the FOIA process. These resources are available at http://www.dhs.gov/freedom-information-act-foia. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under subpart B of part 5 as well as under this subpart.\n\n(b) As referenced in this subpart, component means the FOIA office of each separate organizational entity within DHS that reports directly to the Office of the Secretary.\n\n(c) DHS has a decentralized system for processing requests, with each component handling requests for its records.\n\n(d) Unofficial release of DHS information. The disclosure of exempt records, without authorization by the appropriate DHS official, is not an official release of information; accordingly, it is not a FOIA release. Such a release does not waive the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to assert FOIA exemptions to withhold the same records in response to a FOIA request. In addition, while the authority may exist to disclose records to individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this part apply if the same individual seeks the records in a private or personal capacity.",

          "content": "§ 5.3   Requirements for making requests.\n(a) General information. (1) DHS has a decentralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with each component designating a FOIA office to process records from that component. All components have the capability to receive requests electronically, either through email or a web portal. To make a request for DHS records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the records being sought. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the records sought. DHS's FOIA Reference Guide contains or refers the reader to descriptions of the functions of each component and provides other information that is helpful in determining where to make a request. Each component's FOIA office and any additional requirements for submitting a request to a given component are listed in appendix A to this part. These references can all be used by requesters to determine where to send their requests within DHS.\n\n(2) A requester may send their request to the Privacy Office, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE, STOP-0655, or via the internet at https://www.dhs.gov/foia, or via fax to (202) 343-4011, for any of the Headquarters Offices of the Department of Homeland Security listed in Appendix A to Subpart 5. In addition, if a requester does not know which DHS component may maintain responsive records to a request, the requester may explicitly ask for assistance from the DHS Privacy Office with identifying the proper component that most likely maintains any potential responsive records. Upon a request for assistance and based on information provided in the FOIA request and by the requester, the Privacy Office will forward the request to the DHS component(s) that it determines to be most likely, as of the date of the request for information, to maintain the records that are sought. The Privacy Office will notify the requester that it is forwarding the request, including identifying the component(s) where the request has been sent, provide the FOIA Public Liaison contact information for the respective component(s), and provide administrative appeal rights in the response. If the requester does not agree with the Privacy Office's determination regarding which components would likely have records responsive to the request, the requester must submit a timely appeal of the Privacy Office's determination. Although these are not to be considered misdirected requests, the recipient DHS component shall be granted the same number of days to respond as permitted by 6 CFR 5.4(c) and 5.5(a).\n\n(3) A requester who is making a request for records about him or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in subpart B of this part.\n\n(4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual, in compliance with the verification of identity provision set forth in subpart B of this part, or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component's filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Requesters should refer to appendix A to this part for additional component-specific requirements. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component's FOIA Officer or FOIA public liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request, a component determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component should inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the DHS Privacy Office, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.\n\n(c) If a request does not adequately describe the records sought, DHS may at its discretion either administratively close the request or seek additional information from the requester. Requests for clarification or more information will be made in writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible). Requesters may respond by U.S. Mail or by electronic mail regardless of the method used by DHS to transmit the request for additional information. In order to be considered timely, responses to requests for additional information must be postmarked or received by electronic mail within 30 working days of the postmark date or date of the electronic mail request for additional information or received by electronic mail by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on the 30th working day. If the requester does not respond to a request for additional information within thirty (30) working days, the request may be administratively closed at DHS's discretion. This administrative closure does not prejudice the requester's ability to submit a new request for further consideration with additional information.\n\n[81 FR 83632, Nov. 22, 2016, as amended at 87 FR 68601, Nov. 16, 2022; 89 FR 14370, Feb. 27, 2024]",

          "section_name": "§ 5.4   Responsibility for responding to requests.",
          "content": "§ 5.4   Responsibility for responding to requests.\n(a) In general. Except in the instances described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the component that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the component responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the component shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), shall not be considered responsive to a request.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that component.\n\n(c) Forwarding misdirected requests. Where a component's FOIA office determines that a request was misdirected within DHS, the receiving component's FOIA office, within 10 working days, shall route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component(s) for processing. Once the misdirected request has been forwarded and received by the appropriate DHS component, the 20-working day-time period to respond to the request commences, but in any event not later than 10 days after the request is first received by any DHS component that is designated in the DHS regulations to receive FOIA requests. A request is not a misdirected request if the receiving DHS component may maintain records responsive to any portion of the request. In other words, the receiving DHS component is not obligated to forward to other DHS components that may maintain responsive records unless those other DHS components are explicitly listed in the request.\n\n(d) Consultations, coordination and referrals. When a component determines that it maintains responsive records that either originated with another component or agency, or which contains information provided by, or of substantial interest to, another component or agency, then it shall proceed in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as appropriate:\n\n(1) The component may respond to the request, after consulting with the component or the agency that originated or has a substantial interest in the records involved.\n\n(2) The component may respond to the request after coordinating with the other components or agencies that originated the record. This may include situations where the standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement component responding to a request for records on a living third party locates records within its files originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component locates material within its files originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component that received the request should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the component that originally received the request.\n\n(3) The component may refer the responsibility for responding to the request or portion of the request to the component or agency best able to determine whether to disclose the relevant records, or to the agency that created or initially acquired the record as long as that agency is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the component or agency that created or initially acquired the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. The referring component shall document the referral and maintain a copy of the records that it refers.\n\n(e) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component shall determine whether information is currently and properly classified and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with 6 CFR part 7. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another component or agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving component shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the component or agency that classified the information, or should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information classified by another component or agency, the component shall coordinate with or refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the component or agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(f) Notice of referral. Whenever a component refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component or agency, it will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each component or agency to which the records were referred, unless disclosure of the identity of the component or agency would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, in which case the component should coordinate with the other component or agency, rather than refer the records.\n\n(g) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by DHS will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first component or agency, not any later date.\n\n(h) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components may establish agreements with other components or agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.\n\n(i) Electronic records and searches—(1) Significant interference. The FOIA allows components to not conduct a search for responsive documents if the search would cause significant interference with the operation of the component's automated information system.\n\n(2) Business as usual approach. A “business as usual” approach exists when the component has the capability to process a FOIA request for electronic records without a significant expenditure of monetary or personnel resources. Components are not required to conduct a search that does not meet this business as usual criterion.\n\n(i) Creating computer programs or purchasing additional hardware to extract email that has been archived for emergency retrieval usually are not considered business as usual if extensive monetary or personnel resources are needed to complete the project.\n\n(ii) Creating a computer program that produces specific requested fields or records contained within a well-defined database structure usually is considered business as usual. The time to create this program is considered as programmer or operator search time for fee assessment purposes and the FOIA requester may be assessed fees in accordance with § 5.11(c)(1)(iii). However, creating a computer program to merge files with disparate data formats and extract specific elements from the resultant file is not considered business as usual, but a special service, for which additional fees may be imposed as specified in § 5.11. Components are not required to perform special services and creation of a computer program for a fee is up to the discretion of the component and is dependent on component resources and expertise.\n\n(3) Data links. Components are not required to expend DHS funds to establish data links that provide real time or near-real-time data to a FOIA requester.\n\n[81 FR 83632, Nov. 22, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 14371, Feb. 27, 2024]",

          "content": "§ 5.5   Timing of responses to requests.\n(a) In general. Components ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. Appendix A to this part contains the list of components that are designated to accept requests. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 5.4(c), the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the proper component, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by any DHS component designated in appendix A to this part.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. All components must designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A component may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors a component may consider are the number of pages involved in processing the request or the need for consultations or referrals. Components shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls, and when appropriate, shall offer requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that the request can be placed in a different processing track.\n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limits on that basis, the component shall, before expiration of the twenty-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the component shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing. The component shall make available its designated FOIA Officer and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The component shall also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.\n\n(d) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, components may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Components will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.\n\n(e) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever the component determines that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;\n\n(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or\n\n(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\n\n(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the DHS Office of General Counsel or the component Appeals Officer. Address information is available at the DHS Web site, http://www.dhs.gov/freedom-information-act-foia, or by contacting the component FOIA officers via the information listed in appendix A to part 5. Requests for expedited processing that are based on paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must be submitted to the Senior Director of FOIA Operations, the Privacy Office, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane SW STOP-0655, Washington, DC 20598-0655. A component that receives a misdirected request for expedited processing under the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall forward it immediately to the DHS Senior Director of FOIA Operations, the Privacy Office, for determination. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall commence on the date that the Privacy Office receives the request, provided that it is routed within ten working days, but in no event shall the time period for making a determination on the request commence any later than the eleventh working day after the request is received by any component designated in appendix A to part 5.\n\n(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that he or she is a person who primarily engages in information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful to establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(4) A component shall notify the requester within ten calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.\n\n[81 FR 83632, Nov. 22, 2016, as amended at 87 FR 68601, Nov. 16, 2022]",

Components should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the Internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.\n\n(b) Acknowledgments of requests. A component shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than ten working days to process. Components shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.\n\n(c) Grants of requests. Ordinarily, a component shall have twenty (20) working days from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request unless there are unusual or exceptional circumstances. Once a component makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The component also shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 5.11 and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The component shall inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.\n\n(d) Adverse determinations of requests. A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees, including requester categories or fee waiver matters, or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(e) Content of denial. The denial shall be signed by the head of the component, or designee, and shall include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, for example, by providing the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimation is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 5.8(a), and a description of the requirements set forth therein.\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.\n\n(f) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also shall be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(g) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that a component identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the head of the FOIA office of that component must confer with Department of Justice's Office of Information Policy (OIP) to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) Any component invoking an exclusion shall maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.",

A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.\n\n(c) When notice to submitters is required. (1) A component shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.\n\n(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.\n\n(d) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.

(1) A component will specify a reasonable time period, but no fewer than 10 working days, within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the component a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.\n\n(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component after the date of any disclosure decision will not be considered by the component. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(f) Analysis of objections. A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever a component decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the component shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice, but no fewer than 10 working days.\n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall promptly notify the submitter.\n\n(i) Requester notification. The component shall notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.\n\n(j) Scope. This section shall not apply to any confidential commercial information provided to CBP by a business submitter. Section 5.12 applies to such information.

For the address of the appropriate component Appeals Officer, contact the applicable component FOIA liaison using the information in appendix A to this part, visit www.dhs.gov/foia, or call 1-866-431-0486. An appeal must be in writing, and to be considered timely it must be postmarked or, in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted to the Appeals Officer within 90 working days after the date of the component's response. An electronically filed appeal will be considered timely if transmitted to the Appeals Officer by 11:59:59 p.m. ET or EDT on the 90th working day. The appeal should clearly identify the component determination (including the assigned request number if the requester knows it) that is being appealed and should contain the reasons the requester believes the determination was erroneous. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the letter and the envelope, or the transmittal line in the case of electronic transmissions “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(2) An adverse determination by the component appeals officer will be the final action of DHS.\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee (e.g., component Appeals Officers) is the authorized appeals authority for DHS;\n\n(2) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Appeals Officer shall consult with the Chief Security Officer, and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with 6 CFR part 7;\n\n(3) If the appeal becomes the subject of a lawsuit, the Appeals Officer is not required to act further on the appeal.\n\n(c) Appeal decisions. The decision on the appeal will be made in writing. A decision that upholds a component's determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services, of the National Archives and Records Administration, as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Should the requester elect to mediate any dispute related to the FOIA request with the Office of Government Information Services, DHS and its components will participate in the mediation process in good faith. If the adverse decision is reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be thereafter be further processed in accordance with that appeal decision.\n\n(d) Time limit for issuing appeal decision. The statutory time limit for responding to appeals is generally 20 working days after receipt. However, the Appeals Officer may extend the time limit for responding to an appeal provided the circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i) are met.\n\n(e) Appeal necessary before seeking court review. If a requester wishes to seek court review of a component's adverse determination on a matter appealable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the requester must generally first appeal it under this subpart. However, a requester is not required to first file an appeal of an adverse determination of a request for expedited processing prior to seeking court review.\n\n[81 FR 83632, Nov. 22, 2016, as amended at 87 FR 68601, Nov. 16, 2022]",

          "section_name": "§ 5.11   Fees.",
          "content": "§ 5.11   Fees.\n(a) In general. Components shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. Components will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method for processing requested records. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. If you make a FOIA request, it shall be considered a firm commitment to pay all applicable fees charged under § 5.11, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n(b) Definitions. Generally, “requester category” means one of the three categories in which agencies place requesters for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication; categories include commercial requesters, noncommercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters. The term “fee waiver” means that processing fees will be waived, or reduced, if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a primarily commercial interest. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. A component's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.\n\n(2) Direct costs are those expenses that an agency expends in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.\n\n(3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Components may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.\n\n\nExample 1.A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution if the request adequately describes how the requested information would further a specific research goal of the educational institution.\n\nExample 2.A request from the same professor of geology seeking immigration information from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.\n\nExample 3.A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.\n\nNote:\nThese examples are provided for guidance purposes only. Each individual request will be evaluated under the particular facts, circumstances, and information provided by the requester.\n(5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.\n\n(6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including but not limited to, news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. In contrast, data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to be news media entities. “Freelance” journalists must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity in order to be considered as working for a news media entity. A publication contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.\n\n(7) Review is the page-by-page, line-by-line examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 5.7 or § 5.12, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(8) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records. Components shall ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible by readily available means.\n\n(c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, components shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, unless otherwise stated in § 5.11, components should not add any additional costs to those charges.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Search fees shall be charged for all requests subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. Components may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be as follows: Managerial—$10.25; professional—$7.00; and clerical/administrative—$4.00.\n\n(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program, as referenced in section 5.4, to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.\n\n(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at a federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component will provide one copy per request at a cost of ten cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, components will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, components will charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. Review fees will be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, when the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with a component's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.\n\n(2) If a component fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in (d)(2)(i) through (iii).\n\n(i) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the component provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.\n\n(ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, a component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The component must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the component must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.\n\n(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components will provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $14.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review and/or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to his or her statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided. Two hours of search time will be provided free of charge to non-commercial requesters regardless of whether they agree to pay estimated fees.\n\n(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees he or she is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with his or her statutory entitlements, designates that he or she seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing of the request while it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees he or she is willing to pay and/or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) Components will make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(g) Charging interest. Components may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component. Components will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(h) Aggregating requests. When a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.\n\n(i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, a component shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A component may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which a component requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component's fee determination, the request will be closed.\n\n(j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component will inform the requester of the contact information for that source.\n\n(k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below that established under paragraph (c) of this section, where a component determines, on a case-by-case basis, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government, components will consider the following factors:\n\n(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\n\n(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, components shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.\n\n(3) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components will consider the following factors:\n\n(i) Components shall identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(ii) A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. Components ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.\n\n(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.\n\n(6) Summary of fees. The following table summarizes the chargeable fees (excluding direct fees identified in § 5.11) for each requester category.\n\nCategory\nSearch fees\nReview fees\nDuplication fees\nCommercial-useYesYesYes.\nEducational or Non-Commercial Scientific InstitutionNoNoYes (100 pages free).\nNews MediaNoNoYes (100 pages free).\nOther requestersYes (2 hours free)NoYes (100 pages free).",

          "content": "§ 5.12   Confidential commercial information; CBP procedures.\n(a) In general. For purposes of this section, “commercial information” is defined as trade secret, commercial, or financial information obtained from a person. Commercial information provided to CBP by a business submitter and that CBP determines is privileged or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated as privileged or confidential and will not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request or otherwise made known in any manner except as provided in this section.\n\n(b) Notice to business submitters of FOIA requests for disclosure. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CBP will provide business submitters with prompt written notice of receipt of FOIA requests or appeals that encompass their commercial information. The written notice will describe either the exact nature of the commercial information requested, or enclose copies of the records or those portions of the records that contain the commercial information. The written notice also will advise the business submitter of its right to file a disclosure objection statement as provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CBP will provide notice to business submitters of FOIA requests for the business submitter's commercial information for a period of not more than 10 years after the date the business submitter provides CBP with the information, unless the business submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for, a specific notice period of greater duration.\n\n(1) When notice is required. CBP will provide business submitters with notice of receipt of a FOIA request or appeal whenever:\n\n(i) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as commercially- or financially-sensitive information. The business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement by an authorized representative of the business entity providing specific justification that the information in question is considered confidential commercial or financial information and that the information has not been disclosed to the public; or\n\n(ii) CBP has reason to believe that disclosure of the commercial information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.\n\n(2) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this section will not apply if:\n\n(i) CBP determines that the commercial information will not be disclosed;\n\n(ii) The commercial information has been lawfully published or otherwise made available to the public; or\n\n(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).\n\n(c) Procedure when notice given—(1) Opportunity for business submitter to object to disclosure. A business submitter receiving written notice from CBP of receipt of a FOIA request or appeal encompassing its commercial information may object to any disclosure of the commercial information by providing CBP with a detailed statement of reasons within 10 days of the date of the notice (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The statement should specify all the grounds for withholding any of the commercial information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, should demonstrate why the information is considered to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. The disclosure objection information provided by a person pursuant to this paragraph may be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(2) Notice to FOIA requester. When notice is given to a business submitter under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, notice will also be given to the FOIA requester that the business submitter has been given an opportunity to object to any disclosure of the requested commercial information.\n\n(d) Notice of intent to disclose. CBP will consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose commercial information. Whenever CBP decides to disclose the requested commercial information over the objection of the business submitter, CBP will provide written notice to the business submitter of CBP's intent to disclose, which will include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the commercial information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date which will not be less than 10 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the notice of intent to disclose the requested information has been issued to the business submitter. Except as otherwise prohibited by law, CBP will also provide a copy of the notice of intent to disclose to the FOIA requester at the same time.\n\n(e) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit seeking to compel the disclosure of commercial information covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, CBP will promptly notify the business submitter in writing.",

          "content": "§ 5.20   General provisions.\n(a) Purpose and scope. (1) This subpart contains the rules that the Department of Homeland Security (Department or DHS) follows in processing records under the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act) (5 U.S.C. 552a) and under the Judicial Redress Act of 2015 (JRA) (5 U.S.C. 552a note).\n\n(2) The rules in this subpart should be read in conjunction with the text of the Privacy Act and the JRA, 5 U.S.C. 552a and 5 U.S.C. 552a note, respectively (which provide additional information abo ut records maintained on individuals and covered persons), and JRA designations issued in the Federal Register. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained by the Department. These rules also apply to all records containing Social Security Numbers regardless of whether such records are covered by an applicable system of records maintained by the Department. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures by Department personnel and contractors. In addition, the Department processes all Privacy Act and JRA requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), following the rules contained in subpart A of this part, which gives requesters the benefit of both statutes.\n\n(3) The provisions established by this subpart apply to all Department Components, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(4) DHS has a decentralized system for processing requests, with each component handling requests for its records.\n\n(b) Definitions. As used in this subpart:\n\n(1) Component means the office that processes Privacy Act and JRA requests for each separate organizational entity within DHS that reports directly to the Office of the Secretary.\n\n(2) Request for access to a record means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(1).\n\n(3) Request for amendment or correction of a record means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(2).\n\n(4) Request for an accounting means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (c)(3).\n\n(5) Requester means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act.\n\n(6) Individual means, as defined by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Also, an individual, for purposes of this subpart, but limited to the exclusive rights and civil remedies provided in the JRA, includes covered persons, as defined by the JRA, as a natural person (other than an individual) who is a citizen of a covered country, as designated by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n(7) Record has the same meaning as contained in the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(4), except that in cases covered by the JRA, the term “record” has the same meaning as “covered record” in the JRA, 5 U.S.C. 552a note.\n\n(c) Authority to request records for a law enforcement purpose. The head of a component or designee thereof is authorized to make written requests under subsection 552a(b)(7) of the Privacy Act for records maintained by other agencies that are necessary to carry out an authorized law enforcement activity.\n\n(d) Notice on Departmental use of (b)(1) exception. As a general matter, when applying the Privacy Act (b)(1) exception for authorized disclosures within an agency on a need to know basis, the Department will consider itself a single entity, meaning that information may be disclosed between components of the Department under the (b)(1) exception.",

          "content": "§ 5.21   Requests for access to records.\n(a) How made and addressed. (1) DHS has a decentralized system for responding to Privacy Act and JRA requests, with each component designating an office to process records from that component.\n\n(2) An individual may make a request for access to a Department of Homeland Security record about that individual covered by a DHS-wide or component system of records notice (SORN) by writing directly to the Department component that maintains the record at the address listed in appendix A to this part or via the internet at https://www.dhs.gov/foia. A description of all DHS-wide and component SORNs may be found here: https://www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices-sorns.\n\n(3) In most cases, a component's central FOIA office, as indicated in appendix A to this part, is the place to send a Privacy Act request. For records held by a field office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Coast Guard, or other Department components with field offices other than the U.S. Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration, the requester must write directly to that U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, or other field office address, which can be found by calling the component's central FOIA office. Requests for U.S. Secret Service records should be sent only to the U.S. Secret Service central FOIA office, and requests for Transportation Security Administration records should be sent only to the Transportation Security Administration central FOIA office.\n\n(4) Requests for records held by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) should be sent to the DHS Privacy Office.\n\n(5) DHS's FOIA website refers the reader to descriptions of the functions of each component and provides other information that is helpful in determining where to make a request. Each component's FOIA office and any additional requirements for submitting a request to a given component are listed in appendix A to this part. These references can all be used by requesters to determine where to send their requests within DHS.\n\n(6) An individual may send a request to the Privacy Office, Mail Stop 0655, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20528-0655, or via the internet at https://www.dhs.gov/foia, or via fax to (202) 343-4011 for any of the Headquarters Offices of the Department of Homeland Security listed Appendix A to Subpart 5. In addition, if a requester does not know which DHS component may maintain responsive records to a request, the requester may explicitly ask for assistance from the DHS Privacy Office with identifying the proper component that most likely maintains any potential responsive records citing this section of the regulations. Upon a request for assistance and based on information provided in the FOIA request and by the requester, the Privacy Office will forward the request to the DHS component(s) that it determines to be most likely, as of the date of the request for information, to maintain the records that are sought. The Privacy Office will notify the requester that it is forwarding the request, including identifying the component(s) where the request has been sent, provide the FOIA Public Liaison contact information for the respective component(s), and provide administrative appeal rights in the response. If the requester does not agree with the Privacy Office's determination regarding which components would likely have records responsive to the request, the requester must submit a timely appeal of the Privacy Office's determination. For the quickest possible handling, the requester should mark both the request letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request” or “Judicial Redress Act Request.”\n\n(b) Government-wide SORNs. A government-wide system of records is a system of records where one agency has regulatory authority over records in the custody of multiple agencies, and the agency with regulatory authority publishes a SORN that applies to all of the records regardless of their custodial location. If records are sought that are covered by a Government-wide SORN and requested of DHS, DHS will consult or refer such request, only as applicable and necessary, to the corresponding agency having authority over such records for further processing. DHS will acknowledge to the requester that it is referring the request to another agency or consulting with that agency when processing the request.\n\n(c) Description of records sought. A requester must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Department personnel to locate the system of records covering them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which the requester believes they were compiled, the office or location in which the requester believes the records are kept, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which the requester believes they are kept. The Department publishes notices in the Federal Register that describe its components' systems of records. These notices can be found on the Department's website here: https://www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices-sorns. If a request does not adequately describe the records sought, DHS may at its discretion either administratively close the request or seek additional information from the requester. Requests for clarification or more information will be made in writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible). Requesters may respond by U.S. Mail or by electronic mail regardless of the method used by DHS to transmit the request for additional information. To be considered timely, responses to requests for additional information must be postmarked or received by electronic mail within 30 working days of the postmark date or date of the electronic mail request for additional information. If the requester does not respond timely, the request may be administratively closed at DHS's discretion. This administrative closure does not prejudice the requester's ability to submit a new request for further consideration with additional information.\n\n(d) Agreement to pay fees. DHS and components shall charge for processing requests under the Privacy Act or JRA. DHS and components will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method for processing requested records. DHS may contact a requester for additional information in order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section. DHS ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. If one makes a Privacy Act or JRA request for access to records, it will be considered a firm commitment to pay all applicable fees charged under § 5.29, up to $25.00. The component responsible for responding to a request ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgement letter. When making a request, an individual may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n(e) Verification of identity. When an individual makes a request for access to their own records, their identity must be verified. The individual must provide their full name, current address, date and place of birth, and country of citizenship or residency. The individual must sign the request and provide a signature that must either be notarized or submitted by the requester under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury, as a substitute for notarization. An individual may obtain more information about this process at http://www.dhs.gov/foia or 1-866-431-0486. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, an individual may also voluntarily include other identifying information that are relevant to the request (e.g., passport number, Alien Registration Number (A-Number)).\n\n(f) Verification of guardianship. When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age, for access to records about that individual, the individual submitting a request must establish:\n\n(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and country of citizenship or residency of the individual;\n\n(2) The submitting individual's own identity, in the same manner as required in paragraph (e) of this section;\n\n(3) That the submitting individual is the parent or guardian of the subject of the record, which may be proven by providing a copy of the subject of the record's birth certificate showing parentage or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and\n\n(4) That the submitting individual is acting on behalf of that individual that is the subject of the record.\n\n(g) Verification in the case of third-party information requests. Outside of requests made pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, if a third party requests records about a subject individual, the third party requester must provide verification of the subject individual's identity in the manner provided in paragraph (e) of this section along with the subject individual's written consent authorizing disclosure of the records to the third party requester, or by submitting proof by the requester that the subject individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each component can require a third-party requester to supply additional information to verify that the subject individual has consented to disclosure or is deceased.\n\n[87 FR 68601, Nov. 16, 2022, as amended at 89 FR 14371, Feb. 27, 2024]",

Except as stated in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the component that first receives a request for access to a record, and has possession of that record, is the component responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only those records in its possession as of the date the component begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the component will inform the requester of that date.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or the component head's designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access or amendment to a record of that component.\n\n(c) Misdirected requests, consultations, coordination, and referrals. All misdirected requests and consultations, coordination, and referrals for requests of records subject to the Privacy Act or JRA will follow the same process and procedures as described in § 5.4(c) and § 5.4(d), including how to handle those requests that pertain to law enforcement information, as specified in § 5.4(d)(2), and classified information, as specified in § 5.4(d)(2) and (e). Further, whenever a request is made for access to a record containing information that has been classified by or may be appropriate for classification by another component or agency under any relevant Executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving component will refer to § 5.24 for processing.\n\n(d) Release of medical records. (1) Generally, an individual has the right to access their medical records maintained by the Department. Special procedures for requests from an individual requesting medical records that include psychological records for which direct release may cause harm to the individual requesting access are set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) If a request is made for access to medical records that include psychological records, and a component medical practitioner or qualified designee determines that direct release is likely to adversely affect the individual who is requesting access, the component will request the individual to provide the name and contact information of a representative who is capable of ameliorating the potential adverse effect. The representative may be a physician or other health professional who will be willing to review the record and inform the requester of its contents. Once provided, the component FOIA office or designated component official will send the medical records to the individual's designated representative. The component will inform the subject individual in writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible) that the record has been sent to that individual's chosen representative. The representative does not have the discretion to withhold any part of the individual's record. If the subject individual does not comply with the procedural requirement to designate a representative, the component may decline to release the requested information.\n\n(3) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply to Coast Guard records held by another agency.\n\n(e) Notice of referral. Whenever a component refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component or agency, it ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each component or agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.\n\n(f) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by DHS will be handled according to the date the Privacy Act or JRA access request was initially received by the first component or agency, not any later date.\n\n(g) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components may establish agreements with other components or agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to types of records.\n\n[87 FR 68601, Nov. 16, 2022, as amended at 89 FR 14371, Feb. 27, 2024]",

Components should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.\n\n(b) Acknowledgements of requests. Consistent with the procedures in subpart A of this part, a component will acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than ten (10) working days to process. Components will include in the acknowledgement letter a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests. Further, in the acknowledgment letter, the component will confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under §§ 5.21(d) and 5.29.\n\n(c) Grants of requests for access. Consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, a component will have twenty (20) working days from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request unless there are unusual or exceptional circumstances as defined by the FOIA and set out in § 5.5(c). Once a component decides to grant a request for access to record(s) in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The component will inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under §§ 5.21(d) and 5.29 and will disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. The component will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Liaison to offer assistance.\n\n(d) Adverse determinations of requests for access. A component making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the requested record does not exist or cannot be located; or the record requested is not subject to the Privacy Act or JRA. Further, adverse determinations also include disputes regarding fees, or denials of a request for expedited processing. The denial letter will be signed by the head of the component, or the component head's designee, and will include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied by the component in denying the request; and\n\n(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 5.25(a) and a description of the requirements of § 5.25(a).\n\n(e) JRA access requests.

An appeal must be in writing, and to be considered timely it must be postmarked or, in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted to the Appeals Officer within 90 working days, consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, after the date of the component's response. An electronically filed appeal will be considered timely if transmitted to the Appeals Officer by 11:59:59 p.m. EST or EDT on the 90th working day. The appeal should clearly identify the component determination (including the assigned request number if the requester knows it) that is being appealed and should contain the reasons the requester believes the determination was erroneous. For the quickest possible handling, an individual should mark both the appeal letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Appeal” or “Judicial Redress Act Appeal.”\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. The DHS Office of the General Counsel, or its designee, (e.g., Component Appeals Officer) is the authorized appeals authority for DHS. On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Appeals Officer will consult with the Chief Security Officer and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with 6 CFR part 7. If the appeal becomes the subject of a lawsuit, the Appeals Officer is not required to act further on the appeal.\n\n(c) Appeal decisions. Consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, the decision on an appeal will be made in writing generally twenty (20) working days after receipt. However, consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, the time limit for responding to an appeal may be extended provided the circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i) are met. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform the requester of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision. An adverse determination by the DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee or Component Appeals Officer will be the final action of the Department.\n\n(d) Appeal necessary before seeking court review. If an individual wishes to seek review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request by DHS within the allotted 20 working days to respond unless there are unusual or exceptional circumstances, that individual must first appeal it under this subpart.

The requester may submit any documentation that the requester thinks would support the request. If the individual believes that the same record is in more than one system of records, the requester should state that and address the request to each component that maintains a system of records containing the record.\n\n(b) Component responses. Within ten working days of receiving a request for amendment or correction of records, a component will send the requester a written acknowledgment of its receipt of the request, and it will promptly notify the requester whether the request is granted or denied. If the component grants the request in whole or in part, it will describe the amendment or correction made and will advise the requester of the right to obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record, in disclosable form.

Within 90 working days after the date of the component's response, the requester may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction to the Component Appeals Officer or the DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee. The Component Appeals Officer or the DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee must complete its review and make a final determination on the requester's appeal no later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date on which the individual requests such review unless good cause is shown, and communicated to the individual, for which the 30-day period may be extended for an additional 30 days.

The implementing regulations and reasons provided for exemptions can be found in appendix C to this part, titled DHS Systems of Records Exempt from the Privacy Act.\n\n(d) Statements of Disagreement. If an individual's appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, that individual has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement, unless exempt, that states the individual's reason(s) for disagreeing with the Department's denial of the request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. The individual's Statement of Disagreement must be sent to the component involved, which will place it in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and will mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been filed and where in the system of records it may be found.\n\n(e) Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement. Within 30 working days of the amendment or correction of a record, the component that maintains the record will, unless exempt, notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made or should have been made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of Disagreement, the component will append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.\n\n(f) Records not subject to amendment or correction. The following records are not subject to amendment or correction:\n\n(1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements made under oath;\n\n(2) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those proceedings;\n\n(3) Presentence records that originated with the courts; and\n\n(4) Records in systems of records that have been exempted from amendment and correction under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k)) pursuant to a final rule published in the Federal Register.",

Components are not required to provide accountings to the requester where they relate to:\n\n(1) Disclosures for which accountings are, by statute (5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(1)), not required to be kept, such as disclosures that are made to officers and employees within the agency and disclosures that are required to be made under the FOIA, or for records covered by the JRA;\n\n(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or\n\n(3) Disclosures made from systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements by a rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k).\n\n(c) Appeals. A requester may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting to the Component Appeals Officer or the DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 5.25) and the same procedures will be followed.",

          "content": "§ 5.30   Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.\n(a) Court-ordered disclosures. When the component discloses an individual's information covered by a system of records pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order is a matter of public record, the Privacy Act requires the component to send a notice of the disclosure to the last known address of the person whose record was disclosed. Notice will be given within a reasonable time after the component's receipt of the order, except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice will be given only after the order becomes public. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice will not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.\n\n(b) Court. For purposes of this section, a court is an institution of the judicial branch of the U.S. Federal Government consisting of one or more judges who seek to adjudicate disputes and administer justice. Entities not in the judicial branch of the Federal Government are not courts for purposes of this section.\n\n(c) Court order. For purposes of this section, a court order is any legal process which satisfies all the following conditions:\n\n(1) It is issued under the authority of a Federal court;\n\n(2) A judge or a magistrate judge of that court signs it;\n\n(3) It commands or permits DHS to disclose the Privacy Act protected information at issue; and\n\n(4) The court is a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(d) Court of competent jurisdiction. It is the view of DHS that under the Privacy Act the Federal Government has not waived sovereign immunity, which precludes state court jurisdiction over a Federal agency or official. Therefore, DHS will not honor state court orders as a basis for disclosure, unless DHS does so under its own discretion.\n\n(e) Conditions for disclosure under a court order of competent jurisdiction. The component may disclose information in compliance with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction if—\n\n(1) Another section of this part specifically allows such disclosure, or\n\n(2) DHS, the Secretary, or any officer or employee of DHS in their official capacity is properly a party in the proceeding, or\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is necessary to ensure that an individual who is accused of criminal activity receives due process of law in a criminal proceeding under the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of the Federal Government.\n\n(f) In other circumstances. DHS may disclose information to a court of competent jurisdiction in circumstances other than those stated in paragraph (e) of this section. DHS will make its decision regarding disclosure by balancing the needs of a court while preserving the confidentiality of information. For example, DHS may disclose information under a court order that restricts the use and redisclosure of the information by the participants in the proceeding; DHS may offer the information for inspection by the court in camera and under seal; or DHS may arrange for the court to exclude information identifying individuals from that portion of the record of the proceedings that is available to the public.\n\n(g) Emergency disclosures. Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an individual made under compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, the component will notify the individual to whom the record pertains of the disclosure. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure.\n\n(h) Other regulations on disclosure of information in litigation. See subpart C to this part for additional rules covering disclosure of information and records governed by this part and requested in connection with legal proceedings.",

Except to the extent a Department component has adopted separate guidance governing the subject matter of a provision of this subpart, the provisions of this subpart shall apply to each component of the Department. Departmental components may issue their own guidance under this subpart subject to the approval of the General Counsel of the Department.\n\n(c) For purposes of this subpart, and except as the Department may otherwise determine in a particular case, the term employee includes all former Secretaries of Homeland Security and all employees of the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies who are or were appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of the Secretary of Homeland Security, whether residing or working in the United States or abroad, including United States nationals, foreign nationals, and contractors. The procedures established within this subpart also apply to former employees of the Department where specifically noted.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subpart, the term litigation encompasses all pre-trial, trial, and post-trial stages of all judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before courts, commissions, boards (including the Board of Appellate Review), grand juries, or other judicial or quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, whether criminal, civil, or administrative in nature. This subpart governs, inter alia, responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pre-trial, trial, or post-trial proceedings, as well as responses to informal requests by attorneys or others in situations involving litigation. However, this subpart shall not apply to any claims against the Department by Department of Homeland Security employees (present or former), or applicants for Department employment, for which jurisdiction resides with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board; the Office of Special Counsel; the Federal Labor Relations Authority; the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board; the Foreign Service Grievance Board; or a labor arbitrator operating under a collective bargaining agreement between the Department and a labor organization representing Department employees; or their successor agencies or entities.\n\n(e) For purposes of this subpart, official information means all information of any kind, however stored, that is in the custody and control of the Department, relates to information in the custody and control of the Department, or was acquired by Department employees, or former employees, as part of their official duties or because of their official status within the Department while such individuals were employed by or served on behalf of the Department.\n\n(f) Nothing in this subpart affects disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, Executive Order 12958 on national security information (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333), the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b, the Department's implementing regulations or pursuant to congressional subpoena.

The Chief Security Officer shall review the information and after consulting with the applicable original classification authority and other components and agencies with equities, make a recommendation to the Secretary on whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. The Secretary shall decide whether to declassify the information. The decision of the Secretary shall be final. This provision does not amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification or create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.\n\n(d) Each component shall develop schedules for declassification of records in the National Archives.",

However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.\n\n(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal action include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.\n\n(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.\n\n(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.",

The provisions of 31 CFR parts 285, 900-904, as amended by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, are applicable to debts and debt procedures within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n(b) Authority. The Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Homeland Security is delegated authority to administer this subpart and to redelegate authority under this subpart.\n\n(c) Application to DHS. This subpart provides procedures for the collection of DHS debts, and for collection of other debts owed to the United States when a request for offset of a DHS payment is received by the DHS from another federal agency. This subpart applies to all of DHS, including all of its components. It applies to the DHS when collecting a DHS debt, to persons who owe DHS debts, and to Federal agencies requesting offset of a payment issued by the DHS as a payment agency (including salary payments to DHS employees).\n\n(d) Exclusions. This subpart does not apply to debt arising from taxation under the Internal Revenue Act of 1986, as amended, or to any debt excepted from the FCCS, 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.\n\n(e) Non-exclusive procedure or remedy. Nothing in this subpart precludes collection or disposition of any debt under statutes and regulations other than those described in this subpart. To the extent that the provisions of laws or other regulations apply, including the remission or mitigation of fines, penalties, forfeitures and debts arising under the tariff laws of the United States, DHS components are authorized to collect debts under those laws and regulations. DHS components and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple collection remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law.\n\n(f) Additional policies and procedures. DHS components may, but are not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures consistent with this subpart and other applicable Federal law, policies, and procedures.\n\n(g) Duplication not required. Nothing in this subpart requires DHS to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract, this subpart, or other laws or regulations.\n\n(h) No private rights created. This subpart does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person, nor shall the failure of any DHS component to comply with any of the provisions of this subpart or 31 CFR parts 285, 900-904 be a defense to the collection of any debt or enforcement of any other law.",

          "content": "§ 11.4   Collection by administrative offset.\n(a) General Provisions for Offset. DHS will collect debts by administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR parts 900-904.\n\n(b) Centralized Offset through the Treasury Offset Program. DHS adopts the provisions of 31 CFR 901.3.\n\n(c) Non-centralized Offset for DHS Debts. When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, DHS may collect delinquent DHS debts through non-centralized offset. In these cases, DHS may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to offset a payment owed to the debtor. Before requesting a payment authorizing agency to conduct a non-centralized administrative offset, DHS will provide the debtor with the due process set forth in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4) and the notice requirements of 31 CFR 901.2 (unless the due process and notice requirements are not required under that part). DHS will provide the payment authorizing agency written certification that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that DHS has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.\n\n(d) Hearing Procedures for Federal Employees—(1) Request for a hearing. A Federal employee who has received a notice that his or her DHS debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt. The Federal employee also may request a hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in section 11.4(c). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th calendar day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. All travel expenses incurred by the Federal employee in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the employee.\n\n(2) Failure to submit timely request for hearing. If the employee fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, DHS should accept a late request for hearing if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.\n\n(3) Hearing official. DHS must obtain the services of a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Secretary. The DHS Chief Financial Officer will coordinate DHS efforts to obtain the services of a hearing official.\n\n(4) Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, the designated hearing official informs the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice sets forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice provides the employee the date by which he or she should submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing official gives the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The hearing official schedules a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing official gives both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.\n\n(5) Oral hearing. The hearing official conducts an oral hearing if he or she determines the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing, but may be conducted in a manner determined by the hearing official, including but not limited to:\n\n(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument;\n\n(ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee by the hearing official; or\n\n(iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.\n\n(6) Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she makes the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of his or her position.\n\n(7) Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence. In the absence of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary evidence as required for a paper hearing, the employee waives the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. Further, the employee is deemed to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent to offset. If a DHS representative does not appear at an oral hearing, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties.\n\n(8) Burden of proof. DHS has the initial burden to prove the existence and amount of the debt. Thereafter, if the employee disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.\n\n(9) Record. The hearing official maintains a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart. Witnesses testify under oath or affirmation in oral hearings.\n\n(10) Date of decision. The hearing official issues a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for hearing was received by DHS. If the employee requests a delay in the proceedings, the deadline for the decision may be postponed by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. When a decision is not timely rendered, DHS waives penalties applied to the debt for the period beginning with the date the decision is due and ending on the date the decision is issued.\n\n(11) Content of decision. The written decision includes:\n\n(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.\n\n(12) Final agency action. The hearing official's decision is final.\n\n(f) Waiver not precluded. Nothing in this subpart precludes an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory authority.\n\n(g) Salary offset process—(1) Determination of disposable pay. The Chief Financial Officer consults with the appropriate DHS payroll office to determine the amount of a DHS employee's disposable pay and will implement salary offset when requested to do so by a DHS component or another federal agency. If the debtor is not employed by DHS, the agency employing the debtor will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and implement salary offset upon request.\n\n(2) Amount of salary offset. The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, as follows:\n\n(i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the disposable pay, such debt generally is collected in one lump sum payment; or\n\n(ii) Installment deductions are made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount or the creditor agency has determined that smaller deductions are appropriate based on the employee's ability to pay.\n\n(3) Final salary payment. After the employee has separated either voluntarily or involuntarily from the payment agency, the payment agency may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to satisfy a debt.\n\n(h) Payment agency's responsibilities. (1) As required by 5 CFR 550.1109, if the employee separates from the payment agency from which DHS requested salary offset, the payment agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify DHS and the employee of the amounts collected. If the payment agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such retirement payments that the debtor owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that DHS has complied with the provisions of this section. DHS must submit a properly certified claim to the new payment agency before the collection can be made.\n\n(2) If the employee is already separated from employment and all payments due from his or her former payment agency have been made, DHS may request that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar funds, is administratively offset to collect the debt. Generally, DHS will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in this section.\n\n(3) When an employee transfers to another agency, DHS should resume collection with the employee's new payment agency in order to continue salary offset.",

Those agencies must comply with 31 CFR 901.3 when forwarding the requests to DHS. DHS does not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with regard to the existence or the amount of the debt. When two or more agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, DHS may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by offset simultaneously. For the purposes of this section, debts owed to DHS generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies, but DHS may pay a debt to another agency prior to collecting for DHS. DHS determines the order of debt collection based upon the best interests of the United States.",

          "content": "§ 11.15   Applying the debt against DHS payments.\n(a) Notice to the Debtor. DHS sends a written notice to the debtor indicating a certified debt claim was received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed by the creditor agency, the estimated date the offset will begin (if more than one payment), and the amount of the deduction(s). For employees, DHS generally begins deductions from pay at the next officially established pay interval. Deductions continue until DHS knows the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency. If a DHS employee retires or resigns, or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, DHS continues to offset, under 31 U.S.C. 3716, up to 100% of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by DHS. See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 5 CFR 550.1104(l) and 550.1104(m). If the employee is separated from DHS before the debt is paid in full, DHS will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If DHS is aware the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, DHS provides written notice to the agency making such retirement payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in section 11.4.\n\n(b) Notice to the debtor. DHS provides to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under this subpart.\n\n(c) Transfer of employee debtor to another Federal agency. If an employee debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, DHS notifies the creditor agency and provides it a certification of the total amount of its collection on the debt. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.",

Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.\n\n(c) Equal opportunity.

          "content": "§ 27.400   Chemical-terrorism vulnerability information.\n(a) Applicability. This section governs the maintenance, safeguarding, and disclosure of information and records that constitute Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI), as defined in § 27.400(b). The Secretary shall administer this section consistent with 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq., including appropriate sharing with Federal, State, and local officials.\n\n(b) Chemical-terrorism vulnerability information. In accordance with 6 U.S.C. 623, the following information, whether transmitted verbally, electronically, or in written form, shall constitute CVI:\n\n(1) Security Vulnerability Assessments under § 27.215;\n\n(2) Site Security Plans under § 27.225;\n\n(3) Documents relating to the Department's review and approval of Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans, including Letters of Authorization, Letters of Approval, and responses thereto; written notices; and other documents developed pursuant to § 27.240 or § 27.245;\n\n(4) Alternative Security Programs under § 27.235;\n\n(5) Documents relating to inspection or audits under § 27.250;\n\n(6) Any records required to be created or retained under § 27.255;\n\n(7) Sensitive portions of orders, notices, or letters under § 27.300;\n\n(8) Information developed pursuant to §§ 27.200 and 27.205; and\n\n(9) Other information developed for chemical facility security purposes that the Secretary, in his or her discretion, determines is similar to the information protected in § 27.400(b)(1) through (8) and thus warrants protection as CVI.\n\n(c) Covered persons. Persons subject to the requirements of this section are:\n\n(1) Each person who has a need to know CVI, as specified in § 27.400(e); and\n\n(2) Each person who otherwise receives or gains access to what they know or should reasonably know constitutes CVI.\n\n(d) Duty to protect information. A covered person must:\n\n(1) Take reasonable steps to safeguard CVI in that person's possession or control, including electronic data, from unauthorized disclosure. When a person is not in physical possession of CVI, the person must store it in a secure container, such as a safe, that limits access only to covered persons with a need to know;\n\n(2) Disclose, or otherwise provide access to, CVI only to persons who have a need to know;\n\n(3) Refer requests for CVI by persons without a need to know to the Executive Assistant Director;\n\n(4) Mark CVI as specified in § 27.400(f);\n\n(5) Dispose of CVI as specified in § 27.400(k);\n\n(6) If a covered person receives a record or verbal transmission containing CVI that is not marked as specified in § 27.400(f), the covered person must:\n\n(i) Mark the record as specified in § 27.400(f) of this section; and\n\n(ii) Inform the sender of the record that the record must be marked as specified in § 27.400(f); or\n\n(iii) If received verbally, make reasonable efforts to memorialize such information and mark the memorialized record as specified in § 27.400(f) of this section, and inform the speaker of any determination that such information warrants CVI protection.\n\n(7) When a covered person becomes aware that CVI has been released to persons without a need to know (including a covered person under § 27.400(c)(2)), the covered person must promptly inform the Executive Assistant Director; and\n\n(8) In the case of information that is CVI and also has been designated as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information under 6 U.S.C. 133, any covered person in possession of such information must comply with the disclosure restrictions and other requirements applicable to such information under 6 U.S.C. 133 and any implementing regulations.\n\n(e) Need to know. (1) A person, including a State or local official, has a need to know CVI in each of the following circumstances:\n\n(i) When the person requires access to specific CVI to carry out chemical facility security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by the Department.\n\n(ii) When the person needs the information to receive training to carry out chemical facility security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by the Department.\n\n(iii) When the information is necessary for the person to supervise or otherwise manage individuals carrying out chemical facility security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by the Department.\n\n(iv) When the person needs the information to provide technical or legal advice to a covered person, who has a need to know the information, regarding chemical facility security requirements of Federal law.\n\n(v) When the Department determines that access is required under § 27.400(h) or § 27.400(i) in the course of a judicial or administrative proceeding.\n\n(2) Federal employees, contractors, and grantees. (i) A Federal employee has a need to know CVI if access to the information is necessary for performance of the employee's official duties.\n\n(ii) A person acting in the performance of a contract with or grant from the Department has a need to know CVI if access to the information is necessary to performance of the contract or grant. Contractors or grantees may not further disclose CVI without the consent of the Executive Assistant Director.\n\n(iii) The Department may require that non-Federal persons seeking access to CVI complete a non-disclosure agreement before such access is granted.\n\n(3) Background check. The Department may make an individual's access to the CVI contingent upon satisfactory completion of a security background check or other procedures and requirements for safeguarding CVI that are satisfactory to the Department.\n\n(4) Need to know further limited by the Department. For some specific CVI, the Department may make a finding that only specific persons or classes of persons have a need to know.\n\n(5) Nothing in § 27.400(e) shall prevent the Department from determining, in its discretion, that a person not otherwise listed in § 27.400(e) has a need to know CVI in a particular circumstance.\n\n(f) Marking of paper records. (1) In the case of paper records containing CVI, a covered person must mark the record by placing the protective marking conspicuously on the top, and the distribution limitation statement on the bottom, of:\n\n(i) The outside of any front and back cover, including a binder cover or folder, if the document has a front and back cover;\n\n(ii) Any title page; and\n\n(iii) Each page of the document.\n\n(2) Protective markings. The protective marking is: CHEMICAL-TERRORISM VULNERABILITY INFORMATION.\n\n(3) Distribution limitation statement. The distribution limitation statement is: WARNING: This record contains Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information controlled by 6 CFR 27.400. Do not disclose to persons without a “need to know” in accordance with 6 CFR 27.400(e). Unauthorized release may result in civil penalties or other action. In any administrative or judicial proceeding, this information shall be treated as classified information in accordance with 6 CFR 27.400(h) and (i).\n\n(4) Other types of records. In the case of non-paper records that contain CVI, including motion picture films, videotape recordings, audio recordings, and electronic and magnetic records, a covered person must clearly and conspicuously mark the records with the protective marking and the distribution limitation statement such that the viewer or listener is reasonably likely to see or hear them when obtaining access to the contents of the record.\n\n(g) Disclosure by the Department—(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, and notwithstanding the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), and other laws, records containing CVI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor does the Department release such records to persons without a need to know.\n\n(2) Disclosure of Segregable Information under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. If a record is marked to signify both CVI and information that is not CVI, the Department, on a proper Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act request, may disclose the record with the CVI redacted, provided the record is not otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act.\n\n(h) Disclosure in administrative enforcement proceedings. (1) The Department may provide CVI to a person governed by 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq., and his or her counsel, in the context of an administrative enforcement proceeding of 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq. when, in the sole discretion of the Department, as appropriate, access to the CVI is necessary for the person to prepare a response to allegations contained in a legal enforcement action document issued by the Department.\n\n(2) Security background check. Prior to providing CVI to a person under § 27.400(h)(1), the Department may require the individual or, in the case of an entity, the individuals representing the entity, and their counsel, to undergo and satisfy, in the judgment of the Department, a security background check.\n\n(i) Disclosure in judicial proceedings. (1) In any judicial enforcement proceeding of 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq., the Secretary, in his or her sole discretion, may, subject to § 27.400(i)(1)(i), authorize access to CVI for persons necessary for the conduct of such proceedings, including such persons' counsel, provided that no other persons not so authorized shall have access to or be present for the disclosure of such information.\n\n(i) Security background check. Prior to providing CVI to a person under § 27.400(i)(1), the Department may require the individual to undergo and satisfy, in the judgment of the Department, a security background check.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(2) In any judicial enforcement proceeding under 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq. where a person seeks to disclose CVI to a person not authorized to receive it under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or where a person not authorized to receive CVI under paragraph (i)(1) of this section seeks to compel its disclosure through discovery, the United States may make an ex parte application in writing to the court seeking authorization to:\n\n(i) Redact specified items of CVI from documents to be introduced into evidence or made available to the defendant through discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;\n\n(ii) Substitute a summary of the information for such CVI; or\n\n(iii) Substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the CVI would tend to prove.\n\n(3) The court shall grant a request under paragraph (i)(2) of this section if, after in camera review, the court finds that the redacted item, stipulation, or summary is sufficient to allow the defendant to prepare a defense.\n\n(4) If the court enters an order granting a request under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the entire text of the documents to which the request relates shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.\n\n(5) If the court enters an order denying a request of the United States under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the United States may take an immediate, interlocutory appeal of the court's order in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 2339B(f)(4), (5). For purposes of such an appeal, the entire text of the documents to which the request relates, together with any transcripts of arguments made ex parte to the court in connection therewith, shall be maintained under seal and delivered to the appellate court.\n\n(6) Except as provided otherwise at the sole discretion of the Secretary, access to CVI shall not be available in any civil or criminal litigation unrelated to the enforcement under 6 U.S.C. 621 et seq..\n\n(7) Taking of trial testimony—(i) Objection. During the examination of a witness in any judicial proceeding, the United States may object to any question or line of inquiry that may require the witness to disclose CVI not previously found to be admissible.\n\n(ii) Action by court. In determining whether a response is admissible, the court shall take precautions to guard against the compromise of any CVI, including—\n\n(A) Permitting the United States to provide the court, ex parte, with a proffer of the witness's response to the question or line of inquiry; and\n\n(B) Requiring the defendant to provide the court with a proffer of the nature of the information that the defendant seeks to elicit.\n\n(iii) Obligation of defendant. In any judicial enforcement proceeding, it shall be the defendant's obligation to establish the relevance and materiality of any CVI sought to be introduced.\n\n(8) Construction. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders or asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privilege.\n\n(j) Consequences of violation. Violation of this section is grounds for a civil penalty and other enforcement or corrective action by the Department, and appropriate personnel actions for Federal employees. Corrective action may include issuance of an order requiring retrieval of CVI to remedy unauthorized disclosure or an order to cease future unauthorized disclosure.\n\n(k) Destruction of CVI. (1) The Department of Homeland Security. Subject to the requirements of the Federal Records Act (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq. and 3301 et seq.), including the duty to preserve records containing documentation of a Federal agency's policies, decisions, and essential transactions, the Department destroys CVI when no longer needed to carry out the agency's function.\n\n(2) Other covered persons—(i) In general. A covered person must destroy CVI completely to preclude recognition or reconstruction of the information when the covered person no longer needs the CVI to carry out security measures under paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(ii) Exception. Section 27.400(k)(2) does not require a State or local government agency to destroy information that the agency is required to preserve under State or local law. \n\n[72 FR 17729, Apr. 9, 2007, as amended at 86 FR 41893, Aug. 4, 2021]",

          "content": "§ 37.9   Applications for temporary waiver for mDLs.\n(a) Application process. Each State requesting a temporary waiver must file with TSA a complete application as set forth in §§ 37.10(a) and (b). Application filing instructions may be obtained from TSA at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL.\n\n(b) Decisions. TSA will provide written notice via email to States within 60 calendar days, to the extent practicable, but in no event longer than 90 calendar days, indicating that TSA has made one of the following decisions:\n\n(1) Approved. Upon approval of an application for a temporary waiver, TSA will issue a certificate of waiver to the State, and publish the State's name in a list of mDLs approved for Federal use at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL.\n\n(2) Insufficient. Upon determination that an application for a temporary waiver is incomplete or otherwise deficient, TSA will provide the State an explanation of deficiencies, and an opportunity to address any deficiencies and submit an amended application. States will have 60 calendar days to respond to the notice, and TSA will respond via email within 30 calendar days.\n\n(3) Denied. Upon determination that an application for a waiver fails to meet criteria specified in §§ 37.10(a) and (b), TSA will provide the State specific grounds on which the denial is based, and provide the State an opportunity to seek reconsideration as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(c) Reconsideration—(1) How to File Request. States will have 90 calendar days to file a request for reconsideration of a denied application. The State must explain what corrective action it intends to implement to correct any defects cited in the denial or, alternatively, explain why the denial is incorrect. Instructions on how to file a request for reconsideration for denied applications may be obtained from TSA at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL. TSA will notify States of its final determination within 60 calendar days of receipt of a State's request for reconsideration.\n\n(2) Final agency action. An adverse decision upon reconsideration is a final agency action. A State whose request for reconsideration has been denied may submit a new application at any time following the process set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(d) Terms and conditions. A certificate of waiver will specify—\n\n(1) The effective date of the waiver;\n\n(2) The expiration date of the waiver; and\n\n(3) Any additional terms or conditions as necessary.\n\n(e) Limitations; suspension; termination—(1) Validity period. A certificate of waiver is valid for a period of 3 years from the date of issuance.\n\n(2) Reporting requirements. If a State, after it has been granted a certificate of waiver, makes any significant additions, deletions, or modifications to its mDL issuance processes, other than routine systems maintenance and software updates, that differ materially from the information the State provided in response to §§ 37.10(a) and (b) under which the waiver was granted, the State must provide written notice of such changes to TSA at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL 60 calendar days before implementing such additions, deletions, or modifications. If a State is uncertain whether its particular changes require reporting, the State may contact TSA as directed at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL.\n\n(3) Compliance. A State that is issued a certificate of waiver under this section must comply with all applicable REAL ID requirements in § 37.51(a), and with all terms and conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.\n\n(4) Suspension. (i) TSA may suspend the validity of a certificate of waiver for any of the following reasons:\n\n(A) Failure to comply. TSA determines that a State has failed to comply with paragraph (d)(3) or (e)(2) of this section, or has issued mDLs in a manner not consistent with the information provided under §§ 37.10(a) or (b); or\n\n(B) Threats to security, privacy, and data integrity. TSA reserves the right to suspend a certificate of waiver at any time upon discovery that Federal acceptance of a State's mDL is likely to cause imminent or serious threats to the security, privacy, or data integrity of any Federal agency. In such instances, TSA will provide written notice via email to each affected State as soon as practicable after discovery of the triggering event, including reasons for suspension, an explanation of any corrective actions a State must take to resume validity of its certificate of waiver.\n\n(ii) Before suspending a certificate of waiver under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section, TSA will provide to such State written notice via email of intent to suspend, including an explanation of deficiencies and instructions on how the State may cure such deficiencies. States will have 30 calendar days to respond to the notice, and TSA will respond via email within 30 calendar days. TSA's response would include one of the following: withdrawal of the notice, a request for additional information, or a final suspension.\n\n(iii) If TSA issues a final suspension, TSA will temporarily remove the State from the list of mDLs approved for Federal acceptance for official purposes. TSA will continue to work with a State to whom TSA has issued a final suspension to resume validity of its existing certificate of waiver. A State that has been issued a final suspension may seek a new certificate of waiver by submitting a new application following the process set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(5) Termination. (i) TSA may terminate a certificate of waiver at an earlier date than specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section if TSA determines that a State—\n\n(A) Does not comply with applicable REAL ID requirements in § 37.51(a);\n\n(B) Is committing an egregious violation of requirements specified under paragraph (d)(3) or (e)(2) of this section that the State is unwilling to cure; or\n\n(C) Provided false information in support of its waiver application.\n\n(ii) Before terminating a certificate of waiver, TSA will provide the State written notice via email of intent to terminate, including findings on which the intended termination is based, together with a notice of opportunity to present additional information. States must respond to the notice within 7 calendar days, and TSA will reply via email within 30 calendar days. TSA's response would include one of the following: withdrawal of the notice, a request for additional information, or a final termination.\n\n(iii) If TSA issues a final termination, TSA will remove the State from the list of mDLs approved for Federal acceptance for official purposes. A State whose certificate of waiver has been terminated may seek a new waiver by submitting a new application following the process set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(6) Reapplication. A State seeking extension of a certificate of waiver after expiration of its validity period must file a new application under paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(f) Effect of status of certificate of waiver. (1) Issuance of a certificate of waiver is not a determination of compliance with any other section in this part.\n\n(2) An application for certificate of waiver that TSA has deemed insufficient or denied, or a certificate of waiver that TSA has deemed suspended, terminated, or expired, is not a determination of non-compliance with any other section in this part.\n\n(g) SSI. Information provided in response to paragraphs (a), (b)(2), (c), (e)(2), (e)(4)(ii), and (e)(5)(ii) of this section may contain SSI, and if so, must be handled and protected in accordance with 49 CFR part 1520.\n\n[89 FR 85377, Oct. 25, 2024]",

          "content": "§ 37.10   Application criteria for issuance of temporary waiver for mDLs; audit report; waiver application guidance.\n(a) Application criteria. A State requesting a certificate of waiver must establish in its application that the mDLs for which the State seeks a waiver are issued with controls sufficient to resist compromise and fraud attempts, provide privacy protections sufficient to safeguard an mDL holder's identity data, and provide interoperability for secure acceptance by Federal agencies under the terms of a certificate of waiver. To demonstrate compliance with such requirements, a State must provide information, documents, and/or data sufficient to explain the means, which includes processes, methodologies, or policies, that the State has implemented to comply with requirements in this paragraph (a).\n\n(1) Provisioning. For both remote and in-person provisioning, a State must explain the means it uses to address or perform the following—\n\n(i) Data encryption. Securely encrypt mDL data and an mDL holder's Personally Identifiable Information when such data is transferred during provisioning, and when stored on the State's system(s) and on mDL holders' mobile devices.\n\n(ii) Escalated review. Review repeated failed attempts at provisioning, resolve such failures, and establish criteria to determine when the State will deny provisioning an mDL to a particular mDL applicant.\n\n(iii) Authentication. Confirm that an mDL applicant has control over the mobile device to which an mDL is being provisioned at the time of provisioning.\n\n(iv) Device identification keys. Confirm that the mDL applicant possesses the mDL device private key bound to the mDL during provisioning.\n\n(v) User identity verification. Prevent an individual from falsely matching with the licensing agency's records, including portrait images, of other individuals.\n\n(vi) Applicant presentation. Prevent physical and digital presentation attacks by detecting the liveness of an individual and any alterations to the individual's appearance during remote and in-person provisioning.\n\n(vii) DHS_compliance data element. Set the value of data element “DHS_compliance”, as required by paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, to correspond to the REAL ID compliance status of the underlying physical driver's license or identification card that a State has issued to an mDL holder as follows—\n\n(A) “F” if the underlying card is REAL ID-compliant, or as otherwise required by AAMVA Mobile Driver's License (mDL) Implementation Guidelines, Section 3.2 (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4); or\n\n(B) “N” if the underlying card is not REAL ID-compliant.\n\n(viii) Data record. Issue mDLs using data, including portrait image, of an individual that matches corresponding data in the database of the issuing State's driver's licensing agency for that individual.\n\n(ix) Records retention. Manage mDL records and related records, consistent with requirements set forth in AAMVA Mobile Driver's License (mDL) Implementation Guidelines (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4).\n\n(2) Issuance. A State must explain the means it uses to manage the creation, issuance, use, revocation, and destruction of the State's certificate systems and keys in full compliance with the requirements set forth in appendix A to this subpart.\n\n(3) Privacy. A State must explain the means it uses to protect Personally Identifiable Information during processing, storage, and destruction of mDL records and provisioning records.\n\n(4) Interoperability. A State must explain the means it uses to issue mDLs that are interoperable with ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021(E) and the “AAMVA mDL data element set” defined in the AAMVA Mobile Driver's License (mDL) Implementation Guidelines (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4) as follows:\n\n(i) A State must issue mDLs using the data model defined in ISO/IEC 18103-5:2021(E) section 7 (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4), using the document type “org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL”, and using the name space “org.iso.18013.5.1”. States must include the following mDL data elements defined as mandatory in ISO/IEC 18103-5:2021(E) Table 5: “family_name”, “given_name”, “birth_date”, “issue_date”, “expiry_date”, “issuing_authority”, “document_number”, “portrait”, and must include the following mDL data elements defined as optional in Table 5: “sex”, “resident_address”, “portrait_capture_date”, “signature_usual_mark”.\n\n(ii) States must use the AAMVA mDL data element set defined in AAMVA Mobile Driver's License (mDL) Implementation Guidelines, Section 3.2 (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4), using the namespace “org.iso.18013.5.1.aamva” and must include the following data elements in accordance with the AAMVA mDL Implementation Guidelines: “DHS_compliance”, and “DHS_temporary_lawful_status”.\n\n(iii) States must use only encryption algorithms, secure hashing algorithms, and digital signing algorithms as defined by ISO/IEC 18103-5:2021(E), section 9 and Annex B (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4), and which are included in the following NIST Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS): NIST FIPS PUB 180-4, NIST FIPS PUB 186-5, NIST FIPS PUB 197-upd1, NIST FIPS PUB 198-1, and NIST FIPS PUB 202 (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4).\n\n(b) Audit report. States must include with their applications a report of an audit that verifies the information provided under paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(1) The audit must be conducted by a recognized independent entity, which may be an entity that is employed or contracted by a State and independent of the State's driver's licensing agency,—\n\n(i) Holding an active Certified Public Accountant license in the issuing State;\n\n(ii) Experienced with information systems security audits;\n\n(iii) Accredited by the issuing State; and\n\n(iv) Holding a current and active American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP) credential or ISACA (F/K/A Information Systems Audit and Control Association) Certified Information System Auditor (CISA) certification.\n\n(2) States must include information about the entity conducting the audit that identifies—\n\n(i) Any potential conflicts of interest; and\n\n(ii) Mitigation measures or other divestiture actions taken to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\n(c) Waiver application guidance—(1) Generally. TSA will publish “Mobile Driver's License Waiver Application Guidance” to facilitate States' understanding of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The non-binding Guidance will include recommendations and examples of possible implementations for illustrative purposes only. TSA will publish the Guidance on the REAL ID website at www.tsa.gov/real-id/mDL.\n\n(2) Updates.

The applicant must also present a second document from § 37.11(g)(1) or documentation issued by DHS or other Federal agencies demonstrating lawful status as determined by USCIS. All documents shall be verified in the manner prescribed in § 37.13.\n\n(h) Exceptions Process. A State DMV may choose to establish a written, defined exceptions process for persons who, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to present all necessary documents and must rely on alternate documents to establish identity or date of birth. Alternative documents to demonstrate lawful status will only be allowed to demonstrate U.S. citizenship.\n\n(1) Each State establishing an exceptions process must make reasonable efforts to establish the authenticity of alternate documents each time they are presented and indicate that an exceptions process was used in the applicant's record.\n\n(2) The State shall retain copies or images of the alternate documents accepted pursuant to § 37.31 of this part.\n\n(3) The State shall conduct a review of the use of the exceptions process, and pursuant to subpart E of this part, prepare and submit a report with a copy of the exceptions process as part of the certification documentation detailed in § 37.55.\n\n(i) States are not required to comply with these requirements when issuing REAL ID driver's licenses or identification cards in support of Federal, State, or local criminal justice agencies or other programs that require special licensing or identification to safeguard persons or in support of their other official duties. As directed by appropriate officials of these Federal, State, or local agencies, States should take sufficient steps to safeguard the identities of such persons. Driver's licenses and identification cards issued in support of Federal, State, or local criminal justice agencies or programs that require special licensing or identification to safeguard persons or in support of their other official duties shall not be distinguishable from other REAL ID licenses or identification cards issued by the State.",

States are required to subject persons who are involved in the manufacture or production of REAL ID driver's licenses and identification cards, or who have the ability to affect the identity information that appears on the driver's license or identification card, or current employees who will be assigned to such positions (“covered employees” or “covered positions”), to a background check. The background check must include, at a minimum, the validation of references from prior employment, a name-based and fingerprint-based criminal history records check, and employment eligibility verification otherwise required by law. States shall describe their background check process as part of their security plan, in accordance with § 37.41(b)(4)(ii). This section also applies to contractors utilized in covered positions.\n\n(b) Background checks. States must ensure that any covered employee under paragraph (a) of this section is provided notice that he or she must undergo a background check and the contents of that check.\n\n(1) Criminal history records check. States must conduct a name-based and fingerprint-based criminal history records check (CHRC) using, at a minimum, the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification (IAFIS) database and State repository records on each covered employee identified in paragraph (a) of this section, and determine if the covered employee has been convicted of any of the following disqualifying crimes:\n\n(i) Permanent disqualifying criminal offenses. A covered employee has a permanent disqualifying offense if convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity, in a civilian or military jurisdiction, of any of the felonies set forth in 49 CFR 1572.103(a).\n\n(ii) Interim disqualifying criminal offenses. The criminal offenses referenced in 49 CFR 1572.103(b) are disqualifying if the covered employee was either convicted of those offenses in a civilian or military jurisdiction, or admits having committed acts which constitute the essential elements of any of those criminal offenses within the seven years preceding the date of employment in the covered position; or the covered employee was released from incarceration for the crime within the five years preceding the date of employment in the covered position.\n\n(iii) Under want or warrant. A covered employee who is wanted or under indictment in any civilian or military jurisdiction for a felony referenced in this section is disqualified until the want or warrant is released.\n\n(iv) Determination of arrest status. When a fingerprint-based check discloses an arrest for a disqualifying crime referenced in this section without indicating a disposition, the State must determine the disposition of the arrest.\n\n(v) Waiver. The State may establish procedures to allow for a waiver of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iv) of this section under circumstances determined by the State. These procedures can cover circumstances where the covered employee has been arrested, but no final disposition of the matter has been reached.\n\n(2) Employment eligibility status verification. The State shall ensure it is fully in compliance with the requirements of section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) and its implementing regulations (8 CFR part 274A) with respect to each covered employee. The State is encouraged to participate in the USCIS E-Verify program (or any successor program) for employment eligibility verification.\n\n(3) Reference check. Reference checks from prior employers are not required if the individual has been employed by the DMV for at least two consecutive years since May 11, 2006.\n\n(4) Disqualification. If results of the State's CHRC reveal a permanent disqualifying criminal offense under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or an interim disqualifying criminal offense under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), the covered employee may not be employed in a position described in paragraph (a) of this section. An employee whose employment eligibility has not been verified as required by section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) and its implementing regulations (8 CFR part 274A) may not be employed in any position.\n\n(c) Appeal. If a State determines that the results from the CHRC do not meet the standards of such check the State must so inform the employee of the determination to allow the individual an opportunity to appeal to the State or Federal government, as applicable.\n\n(d) Background checks substantially similar to the requirements of this section that were conducted on existing employees on or after May 11, 2006 need not be re-conducted.",

A DHS-CS employee may not receive additional compensation listed in in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section if such receipt would cause a DHS-CS employee's aggregate compensation for a calendar year to exceed the aggregate compensation limit applicable to that employee. A DHS-CS employee's applicable aggregate compensation limit is the limit amount assigned to the subrange of a salary structure, described in § 158.611, that contains the employee's salary. The Department assigns an aggregate compensation limit to each subrange in a salary structure by assigning the amounts referenced in 5 U.S.C. 5307(d)(1) in ascending order to the subranges, such that each subrange has an aggregate compensation limit that is greater than or equal to the salary maximum of that subrange.\n\n(b) Aggregate compensation. For purposes of this part—\n\n(1) A DHS-CS employee's aggregate compensation means the total of the employee's salary, including any local cybersecurity talent market supplement, and the following types of additional compensation the employee receives under this part:\n\n(i) Recognition payments;\n\n(ii) Payments for special working conditions;\n\n(iii) Payments for quarters allowances, overseas differentials and allowances, and remote worksite allowances, foreign currency allowances, and hostile fire pay; and\n\n(iv) Other similar payments described in CTMS policy as being authorized under this part and provided in accordance with other relevant provisions of law.\n\n(2) The following types of compensation a DHS-CS employee receives under this part are excluded from the employee's aggregate compensation:\n\n(i) Payments or reimbursements for professional development and training;\n\n(ii) CTMS student loan repayments;\n\n(iii) CTMS allowances in nonforeign areas;\n\n(iv) Back pay because of an unjustified or unwarranted talent management action;\n\n(v) Severance pay;\n\n(vi) Lump-sum payments for accumulated and accrued annual leave;\n\n(vii) Voluntary separation incentive payments;\n\n(viii) Payments for reservist differentials; and\n\n(ix) Monetary value of any honorary recognition, leave, or other benefits.\n\n(c) Forfeiture of compensation exceeding limit amount. Except under corrective action described in paragraph (d) of this section, a DHS-CS employee may not receive any portion of a payment for the additional compensation listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section that would cause the employee's aggregate compensation in any calendar year to exceed the applicable limit amount for that employee described in paragraph (a) of this section and the DHS-CS employee forfeits any such portion of a payment.\n\n(d) Corrective actions. The Department may make a corrective action if the Department underestimated or overestimated a DHS-CS employee's aggregate compensation in a calendar year, including if an applicable aggregate compensation limit amount changed, resulting in the employee receiving aggregate compensation in excess of the applicable limit amount for a DHS-CS employee or the Department limiting or prohibiting an employee's aggregate compensation incorrectly. Corrective actions may include the Secretary or designee waiving a debt to the Federal Government for a DHS-CS employee under 5 U.S.C. 5584, if warranted, or making appropriate corrective payments to a DHS-CS employee.",

          "content": "§ 158.612   Local cybersecurity talent market supplement (LCTMS).\n(a) General. The Department may provide a DHS-CS employee a LCTMS to ensure the employee receives a sufficiently competitive salary, as described in § 158.610(a). A LCTMS accounts for the difference between a salary as determined under a salary structure, described in § 158.611, and the Department's determination as to what constitutes a sufficiently competitive salary for that local cybersecurity talent market. The Department determines whether a LCTMS is necessary, and establishes and periodically adjusts local cybersecurity talent markets and local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentages, based on the strategy, information, principles and practices, and priorities listed in § 158.602(a).\n\n(b) Definitions. As used in this section:\n\n(1) Local cybersecurity talent market means the cybersecurity talent market in a geographic area that the Department defines based on the talent market analysis described in § 158.403, and that may incorporate any pay locality established or modified under 5 U.S.C. 5304.\n\n(2) Local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentage means a percentage the Department assigns to a local cybersecurity talent market to increase the amount of a salary provided under a salary structure.\n\n(c) Salary supplement. A LCTMS is considered part of salary under this part and for purposes of applying the aggregate compensation limit described in § 158.604. A LCTMS is also basic pay for purposes under 5 U.S.C. and 5 CFR, except for purposes of determining pay under 5 U.S.C. 7511 and 7512 and 5 CFR part 752.\n\n(d) Eligibility and termination. (1) The Department determines eligibility for a LCTMS under this section and CTMS policy implementing this section. A DHS-CS employee is eligible for a LCTMS if the employee's official worksite, as determined under § 158.704, is located in a local cybersecurity talent market with an assigned local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentage for the salary structure under which the employee's salary is provided.\n\n(2) The Department terminates a LCTMS a DHS-CS employee receives when the employee's official worksite, as determined under § 158.704, is no longer in a local cybersecurity talent market with an assigned local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentage, or the salary structure under which the employee's salary is provided no longer has an assigned local cybersecurity labor market supplement, or both.\n\n(3) A reduction in salary for a DHS-CS employee because of a change in any LCTMS for that employee is not a reduction in pay for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 7512 and 5 CFR part 752.\n\n(e) Limitation. A DHS-CS employee may not receive, and is not entitled to, any portion of a LCTMS that would cause the employee's salary to exceed the applicable salary limitation assigned to the subrange of a salary structure as described in § 158.611 that contains the employee's salary, but the employee may receive the portion of such a LCTMS that would not cause the employee's salary to exceed the applicable salary limitation. A DHS-CS employee may receive a LCTMS that would cause the employee's salary to be in the extended range, described in § 158.613(c), only if the Secretary or designee invokes the extended range under § 158.613(c)(2) for that employee.",

The upper limit of the standard range is equal to the amount of total annual compensation payable to the Vice President under 3 U.S.C. 104.\n\n(c) Extended range. The upper limit of the extended range is 150 percent of the annual rate of basic pay for level I of the Executive Schedule (150% of EX-I).

The Department designates assignments by defining combinations of CTMS qualifications and DHS-CS cybersecurity work associable with qualified positions. CTMS policy implementing this section addresses procedures for DHS organizations to designate assignments, including as a result of designating qualified positions as described in § 158.702.\n\n(b) Staffing assignments. The Department staffs assignments by:\n\n(1) Matching assignments with DHS-CS employees as described in paragraph (d) of this section;\n\n(2) Matching assignments with newly appointed individuals as described in paragraph (c) of this section; or\n\n(3) Seeking to recruit individuals and establish new qualified positions under the talent acquisition system described in § 158.501 and then matching assignments with newly appointed individuals as described in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(c) Initial assignment. Upon appointment of an individual to a qualified position, the Department matches the individual with an assignment based on the alignment of the individual's CTMS qualifications, determined under the assessment program described in § 158.520, to the CTMS qualifications of an assignment. In matching an individual with an initial assignment, the Department may also consider:\n\n(1) Input from the individual;\n\n(2) Input from DHS organizations;\n\n(3) Mission-related requirements; and\n\n(4) Strategic talent priorities.\n\n(d) Subsequent assignments.

The Department determines a DHS-CS employee's official work site for purposes of administering compensation under this part, especially eligibility for any compensation described in §§ 158.612 and 158.643. The Department's determination of a DHS-CS employee's official worksite includes consideration of any of the following for the employee: Telework, variation in location where the employee performs DHS-CS cybersecurity work, and temporary situations affecting the location where the employee performs DHS-CS cybersecurity work.\n\n(c) Documentation. Upon appointment of an individual to a qualified position, the Department documents the individual's official worksite as part of documenting the employee's appointment to a qualified position and the employee's assignment, as described in § 158.706.

          "content": "§ 158.705   Work scheduling.\n(a) Work scheduling system. The Secretary or designee establishes and administers a work scheduling system for DHS-CS employees to ensure:\n\n(1) Agility for the Department in scheduling DHS-CS cybersecurity work to execute the DHS cybersecurity mission;\n\n(2) Availability of DHS-CS employees to perform the DHS-CS cybersecurity work of their assignments;\n\n(3) Clear expectations for DHS-CS employees about when they are expected to perform DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with their assignments;\n\n(4) Flexibility for DHS-CS employees in scheduling and performing DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with their assignments; and\n\n(5) Recording of, accounting for, and monitoring of hours worked by DHS-CS employees.\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section—\n\n(1) Work period means a two-week period of 14 consecutive days that begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday, and is the equivalent of a biweekly pay period defined in 5 U.S.C. 5504 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart F.\n\n(2) Minimum hours of work means the minimum number of hours that a DHS-CS employee is required to work, or account for with time-off, during a work period, and is the equivalent to the term basic work requirement defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121.\n\n(3) Time-off means leave under § 158.651, time-off under § 158.652, and recognition time-off under § 158.633, or other time-off of duty available for DHS-CS employees.\n\n(4) Full-time schedule means 80 hours per work period.\n\n(5) Part-time schedule means a specified number of hours less than 80 hours per work period. When DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with a DHS-CS employee's assignment regularly requires the DHS-CS employee to exceed that employee's specified number of hours per work period, the Department considers, with input from the employee and the employee's supervisor, whether to change the employee's work schedule from part-time to full-time to ensure appropriate compensation under this part, including accrual of leave under § 158.651 and the DHS-CS employee's share of health benefits premiums provided under § 158.653.\n\n(6) Contingent schedule means an irregular number of hours up to 80 hours per work period. A contingent schedule is appropriate only when the DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with a DHS-CS employee's assignment is sporadic and cannot be regularly scheduled in advance. When DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with a DHS-CS employee's assignment is able to be scheduled in advance on a regular basis, the Department changes the employee's work schedule from contingent to part-time or full-time, as appropriate, to ensure appropriate compensation under this part, including accrual of leave under § 158.651 and the DHS-CS employee's share of health benefits premiums provided under § 158.653.\n\n(c) Employee work schedules. (1) A DHS-CS employee's work schedule, and any minimum hours of work associated with the employee's schedule, is determined at the time of appointment and recorded as part of documenting the employee's appointment to a qualified position under § 158.706. A DHS-CS employee on a contingent schedule does not have a minimum number of hours of work but has a maximum number of total hours for the employee's appointment that is determined at the time of appointment and recorded as part of documenting the employee's appointment to a qualified position under § 158.706.\n\n(2) A DHS-CS employee's work schedule, and any minimum hours of work, may change during the employee's service in a qualified position and the Department records any such changes in the documentation associated with the employee's qualified position under § 158.706.\n\n(d) Work schedule requirements. (1) DHS-CS employees are expected to perform DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with their assignments to execute the DHS cybersecurity mission, especially in response to exigent circumstances and emergencies, including cybersecurity incidents defined in 6 U.S.C. 659, without entitlement to more compensation than the employee's salary described in § 158.603. Hours worked by a DHS-CS employee that exceed the employee's minimum hours of work do not affect the employee's salary or result in any automatic compensation, including a type of additional compensation.\n\n(2) A DHS-CS employee on a full-time schedule is expected to work at least 80 hours per work period.\n\n(3) A DHS-CS employee on a part-time schedule is expected to work at least the employee's specified number of hours of work per work period.\n\n(4) A DHS-CS employee on a contingent schedule is expected to work as necessary to perform the DHS-CS cybersecurity work associated with the employee's assignment, not to exceed the maximum number of total hours for the employee's appointment.\n\n(5) DHS-CS employees must report hours worked by the employee. The Department monitors such hours for purposes of managing the DHS-CS, including considering any changes to DHS-CS employees' schedules, and administering compensation, including assisting in consideration of any additional compensation for DHS-CS employees under § 158.642.\n\n(6) A DHS-CS employee on a full-time schedule or a part-time schedule must account for minimum hours of work by the conclusion of the last day of the work period. If the hours worked by the employee are less than the employee's minimum hours of work, the employee must use time-off approved by the employee's supervisor, or must be placed in an appropriate non-pay status for the purposes described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, to account for the difference between hours actually worked by the employee and the employee's minimum hours of work.\n\n(7) A DHS-CS employee on a full-time schedule or a part-time schedule, in coordination with the employee's supervisor, may adjust when work hours are completed in a given work period, to ensure time-off for religious observance, while also completing minimum hours of work. A DHS-CS employee on a contingent schedule, in coordination with the employee's supervisor, may adjust when work hours are completed to ensure time-off for religious observance.\n\n(e) Hours worked and compensation. The Department uses the work scheduling system described in this section in administering compensation under this part, especially salary administration described in § 158.622 and the compensation described in §§ 158.642, 158.650, 158.651, and 158.652. In alignment with the compensation strategy, described in § 158.601, the work scheduling system:\n\n(1) Acknowledges the unpredictable nature of cybersecurity work and the expectation described in § 158.601(c) about working unusual hours and extended hours as needed; and\n\n(2) Reflects an understanding of the cybersecurity talent market, especially current work expectations and arrangements.\n\n(f) Policy. CTMS policy implementing this section addresses:\n\n(1) Procedures for determining, recording, and updating as necessary, DHS-CS employees' work schedules;\n\n(2) Procedures for selecting and communicating anticipated work hours in advance and communicating variances from those work hours;\n\n(3) Requirements regarding reporting and monitoring hours worked;\n\n(4) Procedures for accounting for minimum hours of work; and\n\n(5) Other work scheduling requirements for DHS-CS employees, including DHS-CS employees supporting specific DHS organizations. Such requirements may include designated days, hours, core hours, or limits on the number of work hours per day;",

Career progression in the DHS-CS is not based on length of service in the DHS-CS or the Federal Government. The Department guides the career progression of DHS-CS employees using development strategies based on:\n\n(1) Information from development reviews, described in § 158.806;\n\n(2) Mission-related requirements; and\n\n(3) Strategic talent priorities.\n\n(c) Commitment to continual learning. The Department establishes, maintains, and communicates criteria for continual learning. Such criteria include recommended and required learning activities, including completion of specific courses of study, completion of mission-related training defined in 5 CFR 410.101, performance of certain DHS-CS cybersecurity work as part of assignments, and participation in opportunities for professional development and training described in § 158.640. The Department aims to utilize all available opportunities for DHS-CS employee development, including opportunities under this part and under or based on authorities in 5 U.S.C. and 5 CFR relating to continual learning, professional development, and training, as appropriate.\n\n(d) Verification of qualifications enhancements. The Department verifies DHS-CS employees' enhancement of CTMS qualifications, which may include review by the CTMB or assessment using standardized instruments and procedures designed to measure the extent to which a DHS-CS employee has enhanced the employee's qualifications. Verification of enhancement to CTMS qualifications may require updating the documentation associated with the employee's qualified position, as described in § 158.706.",
