With respect to other criminal matters pursued in state or local courts, the consideration shall also be given to the additional factors in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:\n\n(i) The seriousness of the violation or crime involved;\n\n(ii) The past history or criminal record of the violator or accused;\n\n(iii) The importance of the legal issues presented; and\n\n(iv) The relatedness of the crime to the Office of Inspector General's mission.\n\n(3) The following records described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section will not be released:\n\n(i) Records required to remain confidential by the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, this part, and part 262 of this chapter,\n\n(ii) Records containing information relating to an employee's security or loyalty; and\n\n(iii) Original records.\n\n(4)(i) The following records and testimony may only be produced under the circumstances described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section:\n\n(A) The Office of Inspector General Manual and other operating instructions issued to employees when specifically authorized after consultation with the General Counsel to the Inspector General;\n\n(B) Office of Inspector General criminal investigative reports when specifically authorized after consulting with the General Counsel to the Inspector General; and\n\n(C) Information relating to confidential investigative techniques, confidential sources of information, and information that must be keep confidential under the Inspector General Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. app. 3.

However, if the owner satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, except for property described in § 230.36, such abandoned property must be returned to the owner if a valid claim is filed within three years from the date the property became abandoned, with the following qualifications:\n\n(1) Where property has been placed in official use by the Office of Inspector General, a person submitting a valid claim under this section must be reimbursed the fair market value of the property at the time title vested in the Office of Inspector General, less costs incurred in returning or attempting to return such property to the owner; or\n\n(2) Where property has been sold, a person submitting a valid claim under this section must be reimbursed the same amount as the last appraised value of the property prior to the sale of such property.\n\n(b) In order to present a valid claim under paragraph (a) of this section, the claimant must establish he or she had no actual or constructive notice that he or she was entitled to file a claim pursuant to § 230.32 or § 230.34 prior to the date the property became abandoned. Publication of a notice pursuant to § 230.34 provides constructive notice, unless a claimant can demonstrate circumstances that reasonably precluded his or her access to the published notice.",

(1) This subpart contains the regulations that implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, insofar as the Act applies to the Postal Service. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). The Postal Service FOIA Requester's Guide, an easy-to-read guide for making Postal Service FOIA requests, is available at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\n\n(2) Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under part 266 of this chapter as well as under this subpart.\n\n(3) It is the policy of the Postal Service to make its official records available to the public to the maximum extent consistent with the public interest. This policy requires a practice of full disclosure of those records that are covered by the requirements of the FOIA, subject only to the specific exemptions required or authorized by law. The exemptions from mandatory disclosure for various types of records provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and 39 U.S.C. 410(c) reflect the fact that under some circumstances, the public interest may be better served by leaving the disclosure of particular records to the discretion of the Postal Service rather than by requiring their disclosure. This Postal Service policy does not create any right enforceable in court.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.\n\n(b) Definitions—(1) Record. (i) For purposes of this part, a record is a discrete, distinct, or segregable grouping of information that pertains to a specific topic that is:\n\n(A) Recorded, regardless of media, format, or physical characteristics, including electronic data; and\n\n(B) In the custody or control of the Postal Service.\n\n(ii) The definition of a record does not include any discrete, distinct, or segregable grouping of information created at the discretion of an employee primarily for the employee's convenience and not disclosed to other employees. The definition of a record is not the same as a “document;” a single “document” may be a single record or it may include multiple records and groupings of information that do not constitute records as defined in this section.\n\n(2) Component. For purposes of this subpart, component means any department or facility within the Postal Service that maintains records; the Office of Inspector General; and the Postal Inspection Service. Postal Service refers to all such components collectively.\n\n[82 FR 32767, July 18, 2017, amended at 83 FR 48235, Sept. 24, 2018]",

The Postal Service is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Postal Service's FOIA Requester Service Centers (RSCs) and FOIA Public Liaisons can assist individuals in locating Postal Service records. Descriptions of, and contact information for, the various FOIA RSCs can be found at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\n\n(b) Records available in an electronic format. Records that the FOIA requires the Postal Service to make available for public inspection in an electronic format pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and that are exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), may be accessed through the Postal Service's Web site at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm. The Postal Service must ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. Such records available for public inspection in an electronic format include the following:\n\n(1) Opinions. All final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases by the Judicial Officer and Administrative Law Judges, all final determinations pursuant to section 404(b) of title 39, United States Code, to close or consolidate a post office, or to disapprove a proposed closing or consolidation, all advisory opinions concerning the private express statutes issued pursuant to 39 CFR 310.6, and all supplier disagreement decisions are on file and available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library and, if created on or after November 1, 1996, also at the Postal Service's Web site at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\n\n(2) Administrative manuals and instructions. The manuals, instructions, and other publications of the Postal Service that affect members of the public are available through the Headquarters Library and at many post offices and other postal facilities. Those which are available to the public but are not listed for sale may be inspected in the Headquarters Library, at any postal facility which maintains a copy, or, if created on or after November 1, 1996, through the Postal Service's Web site at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm. Copies of publications which are not listed as for sale or as available free of charge may be requested on an individual basis in accordance with the procedures provided in § 265.3.\n\n(3) Previously released records. Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released to any person pursuant to the FOIA; and that because of the nature of their subject matter, the Postal Service determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; or that have been requested 3 or more times, as well as a general index of such records. Records processed and disclosed after March 31, 1997, are available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library. Any such records created by the Postal Service on or after November 1, 1996, also will be available at the Postal Service's Web site identified at § 265.2(b). Records described in this paragraph that were not created by, or on behalf of, the Postal Service generally will not be available at the Web site. Records will be available in the form in which they were originally disclosed, except to the extent that they contain information that is not appropriate for public disclosure and may be withheld pursuant to this section. Any deleted material will be marked and the applicable exemptions indicated in accordance with § 265.6(d).\n\n(4) Public index. (i) A public index is maintained in the Headquarters Library and at the Web site of all final opinions and orders made by the Postal Service in the adjudication of cases, Postal Service policy statements which may be relied on as precedents in the disposition of cases, administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect the public, and other materials which the Postal Service elects to index and make available to the public on request in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(ii) The index contains references to matters issued after July 4, 1967, and may reference matters issued prior to that date.\n\n(iii) Any person may arrange for the inspection of any matter in the public index in accordance with the procedures of § 265.3.\n\n(iv) Copies of the public index and of matters listed in the public index may be requested through the procedures described in § 265.3, with payment of any applicable fees.\n\n(v) Materials listed in the public index that were created on or after November 1, 1996, will also be available in electronic format at the Postal Service's Web site at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.",

          "content": "§ 265.3   Procedure for submitting a FOIA request.\n(a) To whom submitted. A request must be submitted to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center (RSC). Descriptions of, and contact information for, the various FOIA RSCs can be found at http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm. For assistance in determining the appropriate FOIA RSC, requesters may contact the USPS HQ FOIA Requester Service Center, Privacy and Records Office, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260, telephone (202) 268-2608. Requests for listings of postal employee names should also be sent to the USPS HQ FOIA Requester Service Center.\n\n(b) Form of request. A request to inspect or to obtain a copy of an identifiable Postal Service record must be in writing and bear the caption “Freedom of Information Act Request” or otherwise be clearly and prominently identified as a request for records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, both on the letter and on the envelope or other cover. Requests for records that are labeled incorrectly may be delayed in reaching the appropriate FOIA RSC. A requester must provide his or her full name and mailing address. A requester may also provide a daytime telephone number or email address to facilitate communication regarding his or her request.\n\n(c) Content of request. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Postal Service personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, requesters should include specific information about each record sought, such as the type of record (e.g., contract, report, memorandum, etc.); the title or case number of a specific document or report; the topic or subject matter; the name of the office, facility, functional unit or employees most likely to possess the record; the geographical location, such as a city and state, where the records are thought to exist; the date or general timeframe of the record's creation; and any details related to the purpose of the record. Requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Before submitting requests, requesters may contact the relevant Postal Service FOIA Requester Service Center to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. The request may state the maximum amount of fees for which the requester is willing to accept liability without prior notice. If no amount is stated, the requester will be deemed willing to accept liability for fees not to exceed $25.00. See paragraph (e)(2) of § 265.9.The request may also specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the requested records.\n\n(d) First-party requests. A requester who is making a request for records about himself must provide verification of identity sufficient to satisfy the component as to his identity prior to release of the record. For Privacy Act-protected records, the requester must further comply with the procedures set forth in 39 CFR 266.5.\n\n(e) Third-party requests. Where a FOIA request seeks disclosure of records that pertain to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a written authorization signed by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply a notarized authorization, a declaration, a completed Privacy Waiver as set forth in 39 CFR 266.5(b)(2)(iii), or other additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(f) Improper requests. A request that does not reasonably describe the records sought, or does not comply with the published rules regarding the procedures to be followed for submitting a request, will be deemed to be an improper FOIA request. If after receiving a request, the Postal Service determines that it is improper, the Postal Service will inform the requester as to why the request is improper. If the requester fails to respond to the Postal Service's request for clarification or additional information within 30 calendar days, the Postal Service will assume the requester is no longer interested in pursuing the request and close its file. The FOIA Requester Service Centers and the FOIA Public Liaisons are available to assist requesters in correcting a request that does not reasonably describe the records sought.\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 83 FR 48235, Sept. 24, 2018]",

When a request is received, the FOIA RSC will either respond to the request, or refer the request to the appropriate FOIA RSC or records custodians. The FOIA RSC will advise the requester of any such referral. The Postal Service, the Office of Inspector General of the Postal Service, and the Postal Inspection Service, respectively, are responsible for responding to requests they receive for records they maintain. Records responsive to a request ordinarily will include only records in the Postal Service's possession as of the date of the search. If any other date is used, the Postal Service shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to the request.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The records custodian of the requested record, or his designee, is authorized to grant or to deny the request. FOIA RSC staff may also grant or deny requests.\n\n(c) Receipt and tracking of requests. FOIA RSCs are responsible for the initial receipt and tracking of FOIA requests.\n\n(d) Acknowledgments of requests. FOIA RSCs must acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The acknowledgement of the request must include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 15139, Mar. 27, 2017]",

          "content": "§ 265.5   Timing of responses to requests.\n(a) In general. Requests will ordinarily be responded to according to their order of receipt. A request that is not initially submitted to the appropriate FOIA RSC will be deemed to have been received by the Postal Service at the time that it is actually received by the appropriate FOIA RSC, but in any case a request will be deemed to have been received no later than 10 business days after the request is first received by a FOIA RSC.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. (1) Unless expedited processing has been granted, the Postal Service places each request in simple or complex tracks based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors considered in assigning a request into the complex track may include one or more of the following factors:\n\n(i) The request involves voluminous documents;\n\n(ii) The complexity of the material;\n\n(iii) The request involves record searches at multiple facilities or locations;\n\n(iv) The request requires consultation among components or other agencies;\n\n(v) The number of open requests submitted by the same requester.\n\n(2) Within each track, the Postal Service processes requests in the order in which they are received. When appropriate, the FOIA RSC or the component will notify the requester if it has placed the request in the “Complex” track, and provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request. If the requester limits the scope of the request, it may result in faster processing.\n\n(c) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.\n\n(2) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(3) A component shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously\n\n(d) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances”, as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that basis, the component shall, before the expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing and alert the requester to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services. The component shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose.\n\n(e) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Postal Service may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a single requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Multiple requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 32767, July 18, 2017]",

The component also shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 265.9 and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.\n\n(b) Adverse determinations of requests. A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(c) Content of denial. The denial shall include, to the extent applicable:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 265.8, and a description of the requirements set forth therein.\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.\n\n(d) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(e) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event that a component identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the component must confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) Any component invoking an exclusion must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of exclusion by OIP.\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 83 FR 48235, Sept. 24, 2018]",

A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. The Postal Service will not determine the validity of any request for confidential treatment until a request for disclosure of the information is received. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.\n\n(c) When notice to submitters is required. (1) The Postal Service shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the Postal Service determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) The Postal Service has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.\n\n(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.\n\n(d) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:\n\n(1) The Postal Service determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA or 39 U.S.C. 410(c);\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a Postal Service regulation; if disclosure is required by a Postal Service regulation and the submitter provided written justification for protection of the information under Exemption 4 at the time of submission or a reasonable time thereafter, advanced written notice of the disclosure must be provided to the submitter; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous or overly broad, except that, in such cases, the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) The Postal Service shall specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Postal Service a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter that the information in question is in fact confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.\n\n(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the Postal Service after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the Postal Service. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA. The Postal Service must consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(f) Determination that confidential treatment is warranted. If the Postal Service determines that confidential treatment is warranted for any part of the requested records and that the records will therefore be redacted or withheld, it must inform the requester in writing, and must advise the requester of the right to appeal. A copy of the letter of denial must also be provided to the submitter of the records in any case in which the submitter had been notified of the request.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. If the Postal Service decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Postal Service shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description or copy of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.\n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall promptly notify the submitter. Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall promptly notify the requester.\n\n(i) Requester notification. The Postal Service shall notify a requester whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information.",

          "content": "§ 265.8   Administrative appeals.\n(a) Requirements for making an appeal. Requesters may appeal adverse decisions rendered by the Postal Inspection Service or any Postal Service component by mail to the General Counsel, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260; or by email to foiaappeal@usps.gov. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response; or within a reasonable time if the appeal is from a failure of the custodian to act. The General Counsel may, in his or her discretion, consider late appeals. In the event of the denial of a request or of other action or failure to act on the part of a custodian from which no appeal is taken, the General Counsel may, if he or she considers that there is doubt as to the correctness of the custodian's action or failure to act, review the action or failure to act as though an appeal pursuant to this section had been taken. A letter of appeal should include, as applicable:\n\n(1) A copy of the request, of any notification of denial or other action, and of any other related correspondence;\n\n(2) The FOIA tracking number assigned to the request;\n\n(3) A statement of the action, or failure to act, from which the appeal is taken;\n\n(4) A statement identifying the specific redactions to responsive records that the requester is challenging;\n\n(5) A statement of the relief sought; and\n\n(6) A statement of the reasons why the requester believes the action or failure to act is erroneous.\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The decision of the General Counsel or his or her designee constitutes the final decision of the Postal Service on the issue being appealed. The General Counsel will give prompt consideration to an appeal for expedited processing of a request. All other decisions normally will be made within 20 working days from the time of the receipt by the General Counsel. The 20-day response period may be extended by the General Counsel, or his or her designee, for a period not to exceed an additional 10 working days when reasonably necessary to permit the proper consideration of an appeal, under one or more of the unusual circumstances set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The aggregate number of additional working days utilized, however, may not exceed 10 working days.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(3) On receipt of any appeal, the General Counsel, or his or her designee, must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.\n\n(c) Decisions on appeals. A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds a component's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a custodian's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component will further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester. If not prohibited by or under law, the General Counsel, or his designee may direct the disclosure of a record even though its disclosure is not required by law or regulation.\n\n(d) When appeal is required. Before seeking judicial review of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.\n\n(e) Appeal procedures for the Office of the Inspector General. The appeal procedures for the Office of the Inspector General are described in 39 CFR 230.5.",

          "section_name": "§ 265.9   Fees.",
          "content": "§ 265.9   Fees.\n(a) In general. The Postal Service shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. The Postal Service will conduct searches, review, and duplication in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Postal Service ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to “U.S. Postal Service.”\n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) Commercial-use requester is a requester who asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Postal Service's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.\n\n(2) Direct costs are those expenses that the Postal Service incurs in searching for and duplicating records in order to respond to a FOIA request. In the case of commercial-use requesters, direct costs include reviewing and taking all other measures needed to prepare the records for disclosure.\n\n(3) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(4) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(5) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 265.6, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(6) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, an educational institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. To fall within this fee category, the request must serve the scholarly research goals of the institution rather than an individual research goal.\n\n(7) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.\n\n(8) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Postal Service shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.\n\n(c) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the Postal Service shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (j) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, components should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Postal Service may charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located or if it determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each half hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fee shall be $21.00.\n\n(iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.\n\n(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), or other storage facility, additional costs may be charged for their retrieval.\n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component shall provide one copy per request at a cost of fifteen cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, components shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, components shall charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. Commercial-use requesters shall be charged review fees at the rate of $21.00 for each half hour by personnel reviewing the records. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with a component's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.\n\n(d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.\n\n(2)(i) If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees.\n\n(ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the component provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, the component has an additional 10 days to respond to the request.\n\n(iii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken:\n\n(A) The component provides timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester; and\n\n(B) The component discussed or made three good faith attempts to discuss via mail, email, or telephone how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).\n\n(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components shall provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. (1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester agrees in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service requested by the requester shall be charged. Examples of such services include providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(g) Aggregating requests. In instances where the Postal Service reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, or that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert makes multiple requests for the same records maintained at multiple facilities or components, the Postal Service may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Multiple FOIA requests by a single requester related to the same issue will be aggregated for the purpose of assessing fees. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.\n\n(h) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (h)(2) or (3) of this section, a component shall not require the requester to submit an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A component may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which a component requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component's fee determination, the request will be administratively closed.\n\n(i) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Postal Service to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.\n\n(j) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (c) of this section, where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Postal Service, and\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the Postal Service, components shall consider all four of the following factors:\n\n(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Postal Service, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. A representative of the news media does not automatically satisfy this consideration.\n\n(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.\n\n(3) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components shall consider the following factors:\n\n(i) Whether there is a commercial interest, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. If so, then the requester will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(ii) Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester in disclosure outweighs the public interest, as defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, in disclosure. If so, then the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The component ordinarily shall presume that if a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest is the primary interest served by the requested disclosure. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.\n\n(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 2896, Jan. 10, 2017; 82 FR 12921, Mar. 8, 2017; 83 FR 48235, Sept. 24, 2018; 84 FR 56385, Oct. 22, 2019]",

(1) After an employee receives a demand for testimony or records, the employee shall immediately notify the General Counsel or Chief Field Counsel and request instructions.\n\n(2) An employee may not give testimony or produce records without the prior authorization of the General Counsel.\n\n(3)(i) The General Counsel may allow an employee to testify or produce records if the General Counsel determines that granting permission:\n\n(A) Would be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the demand arises and other applicable laws, privileges, rules, authority, and regulations; and\n\n(B) Would not be contrary to the interest of the United States. The interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, furthering a public interest of the Postal Service and protecting the human and financial resources of the United States.\n\n(ii) An employee's testimony shall be limited to the information set forth in the statement described at paragraph (c)(2) of this section or to such portions thereof as the General Counsel determines are not subject to objection. An employee's testimony shall be limited to facts within the personal knowledge of the employee. A Postal Service employee authorized to give testimony under this rule is prohibited from giving expert or opinion testimony, answering hypothetical or speculative questions, or giving testimony with respect to privileged subject matter. The General Counsel may waive the prohibition of expert testimony under this paragraph only upon application and showing of exceptional circumstances and the request substantially meets the requirements of this section.\n\n(4) The General Counsel may establish conditions under which the employee may testify. If the General Counsel authorizes the testimony of an employee, the party seeking testimony shall make arrangements for the taking of testimony by those methods that, in the General Counsel's view, will least disrupt the employee's official duties. For example, at the General Counsel's discretion, testimony may be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.\n\n(5) If a response to a demand for testimony or records is required before the General Counsel determines whether to allow an employee to testify, the employee or counsel for the employee shall do the following:\n\n(i) Inform the court or other authority of the regulations in this section; and\n\n(ii) Request that the demand be stayed pending the employee's receipt of the General Counsel's instructions.\n\n(6) If the court or other authority declines the request for a stay, or rules that the employee must comply with the demand regardless of the General Counsel's instructions, the employee or counsel for the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), and the regulations in this section.\n\n(7) The General Counsel may request the assistance of the Department of Justice or a U.S. Attorney where necessary to represent the interests of the Postal Service and the employee.\n\n(8) At his or her discretion, the General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this section, where waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of the United States or for other good cause.\n\n(9) If it otherwise is permissible, the records custodian may authenticate, upon the request of the party seeking disclosure, copies of the records. No employee of the Postal Service shall respond in strict compliance with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum unless specifically authorized by the General Counsel.\n\n(e) Postal Service employees as expert witnesses. No Postal Service employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of the Postal Service, for any party other than the United States, except that in extraordinary circumstances, the General Counsel may approve such expert testimony in private litigation. A Postal Service employee may not testify as such an expert witness without the express authorization of the General Counsel. A litigant must obtain authorization of the General Counsel before designating a Postal Service employee as an expert witness.\n\n(f) Substitution of Postal Service employees. Although a demand for testimony may be directed to a named Postal Service employee, the General Counsel, where appropriate, may designate another Postal Service employee to give testimony. Upon request and for good cause shown (for example, when a particular Postal Service employee has direct knowledge of a material fact not known to the substitute employee designated by the Postal Service), the General Counsel may permit testimony by a named Postal Service employee.\n\n(g) Fees and costs. (1) The Postal Service may charge fees, not to exceed actual costs, to private litigants seeking testimony or records by request or demand. The fees, which are to be calculated to reimburse fully the Postal Service for processing the demand and providing the witness or records, may include, among others:\n\n(i) Costs of time spent by employees, including attorneys, of the Postal Service to process and respond to the demand;\n\n(ii) Costs of attendance of the employee and agency attorney at any deposition, hearing, or trial;\n\n(iii) Travel costs of the employee and agency attorney;\n\n(iv) Costs of materials and equipment used to search for, process, and make available information.\n\n(2) All costs for employee time shall be calculated on the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits) and shall include the hourly fee for each hour, or portion of each hour, when the employee is in travel, in attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or is processing or responding to a request or demand.\n\n(3) At the discretion of the Postal Service, where appropriate, costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.\n\n(h) Acceptance of service. This section does not in any way abrogate or modify the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Appendix) regarding service of process.",

If the requested information relates to confidential investigative techniques, or release of the information would adversely affect the law enforcement mission of the Inspection Service, the subpoenaed official, through Inspection Service legal counsel, may request an in camera, ex parte conference to determine the necessity for the release of the information. The entire Manual should not be given to any party.\n\n(7) Notes, memoranda, reports, transcriptions, whether written or recorded and made pursuant to an official investigation conducted by a member of the Inspection Service, are the property of the Inspection Service and are part of the official case file, whether stored with the official file.\n\n(f) Compliance with summonses and subpoenas ad testificandum. (1) If an Inspection Service employee is served with a third-party summons or a subpoena requiring an appearance in court, contact should be made with Inspection Service legal counsel to determine whether and which exemptions or restrictions apply to proposed testimony. Inspection Service employees are directed to comply with summonses, subpoenas, and court orders, as to appearance, but may not testify without authorization.\n\n(2) Postal Inspector reports or records will not be presented during testimony, in either state or federal courts in which the United States, the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party in interest, unless authorized by the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, who will make the decision after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel. If an attempt is made to compel production, through testimony, the employee is directed to decline to produce the information or matter and to state that it may be exempted and may not be disclosed or produced without the specific approval of the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division. The Postal Service will offer all possible assistance to the courts, but the question of disclosing information for which an exemption may be claimed is a matter of discretion that rests with the appropriate official. Paragraph (e) of this section covers the release of Inspection Service documents in cases where the Postal Service or the United States is not a party.\n\n(g) General procedures for obtaining Inspection Service documents and testimony from Inspection Service employees. (1) To facilitate the orderly response to demands for the testimony of Inspection Service employees and production of documents in cases where the United States, the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party, all demands for the production of nonpublic documents or testimony of Inspection Service employees concerning matters relating to their official duties and not subject to the exemptions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and conform to the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) Before or simultaneously with service of a demand described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the requesting party shall serve on the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260-2101, an affidavit or declaration containing the following information:\n\n(i) The title of the case and the forum where it will be heard;\n\n(ii) The party's interest in the case;\n\n(iii) The reasons for the demand;\n\n(iv) A showing that the requested information is available, by law, to a party outside the Postal Service;\n\n(v) If testimony is sought, a summary of the anticipated testimony;\n\n(vi) If testimony is sought, a showing that Inspection Service records could not be provided and used in place of the requested testimony;\n\n(vii) The intended use of the documents or testimony; and\n\n(viii) An affirmative statement that the documents or testimony is necessary for defending or prosecuting the case at issue.\n\n(3) The Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, shall act as agent for the receipt of legal process for demands for production of records or testimony of Inspection Service employees where the United States, the Postal Service, or any other federal agency is not a party. A subpoena for testimony or for the production of documents from an Inspection Service employee concerning official matters shall be served in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure. A copy of the subpoena and affidavit or declaration, if not previously furnished, shall also be sent to the Chief Postal Inspector or the appropriate Postal Inspector in Charge.\n\n(4) Any Inspection Service employee who is served with a demand shall promptly inform the Chief Postal Inspector, or the appropriate Postal Inspector in Charge, of the nature of the documents or testimony sought and all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\n(h) Authorization of testimony or production of documents. (1) The Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel, shall determine whether testimony or the production of documents will be authorized.\n\n(2) Before authorizing the requested testimony or the production of documents, the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division shall consider the following factors:\n\n(i) Statutory restrictions, as well as any legal objection, exemption, or privilege that may apply;\n\n(ii) Relevant legal standards for disclosure of nonpublic information and documents;\n\n(iii) Inspection Service rules and regulations and the public interest;\n\n(iv) Conservation of employee time; and\n\n(v) Prevention of expenditures of government time and resources solely for private purposes.\n\n(3) If, in the opinion of the authorizing official, the documents should not be released or testimony should not be furnished, that official's decision is final.\n\n(4) Inspection Service legal counsel may consult or negotiate with the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony or documents to refine and limit the demand, so that compliance is less burdensome, or obtain information necessary to make the determination whether the documents or testimony will be authorized. If the party or party's counsel seeking the documents or testimony fails to cooperate in good faith, preventing Inspection Service legal counsel from making an informed recommendation to the authorizing official, that failure may be presented to the court or other body conducting the proceeding as a basis for objection.\n\n(5) Permission to testify or to release documents in all cases will be limited to matters outlined in the affidavit or declaration described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or to such parts as deemed appropriate by the authorizing official.\n\n(6) If the authorizing official allows the release of documents or testimony to be given by an employee, arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of documents by the least disruptive methods to the employee's official duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.\n\n(i) While giving a deposition, the employee may, at the option of the authorizing official, be represented by Inspection Service legal counsel.\n\n(ii) While completing affidavits, or other written reports or at any time during the process of preparing for testimony or releasing documents, the employee may seek the assistance of Inspection Service legal counsel.\n\n(7) Absent written authorization from the authorizing official, the employee shall respectfully decline to produce the requested documents, testify, or, otherwise, disclose the requested information.\n\n(8) If the authorization is denied or not received by the return date, the employee, together with counsel, where appropriate, shall appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this section, and respectfully decline to testify or produce any document on the basis of the regulations in this section.\n\n(9) The employee shall appear as ordered by the subpoena, summons, or other appropriate court order, unless:\n\n(i) Legal counsel has advised the employee that an appearance is inappropriate, as in cases where the subpoena, summons, or other court order was not properly issued or served, has been withdrawn, discovery has been stayed; or\n\n(ii) Where the Postal Service will present a legal objection to furnishing the requested information or testimony.\n\n(i) Inspection Service employees as expert or opinion witnesses. No Inspection Service employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's duties or functions at the Postal Service, for any party other than the United States, except that in extraordinary circumstances, the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, may approve such testimony in private litigation. An Inspection Service employee may not testify as such an expert or opinion witness without the express authorization of the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector. A litigant must first obtain authorization of the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, before designating an Inspection Service employee as an expert or opinion witness.\n\n(j) Postal liability. This section is intended to provide instructions to Inspection Service employees and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the Postal Service.\n\n(k) Fees. (1) Unless determined by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statute, the costs of providing testimony, including transcripts, shall be borne by the requesting party.\n\n(2) Unless limited by statute, such costs shall also include reimbursement to the Postal Service for the usual and ordinary expenses attendant upon the employee's absence from his or her official duties in connection with the case or matter, including the employee's salary and applicable overhead charges, and any necessary travel expenses as follows:\n\n(i) The Inspection Service is authorized to charge reasonable fees to parties demanding documents or information. Such fees, calculated to reimburse the Postal Service for the cost of responding to a demand, may include the costs of time expended by Inspection Service employees, including attorneys, to process and respond to the demand; attorney time for reviewing the demand and for legal work in connection with the demand; expenses generated by equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the requested information; travel costs of the employee and the agency attorney, including lodging and per diem where appropriate. Such fees shall be assessed at the rates and in the manner specified in § 265.9.\n\n(ii) At the discretion of the Inspection Service where appropriate, fees and costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.\n\n(iii) The provisions in this section do not affect rights and procedures governing public access to official documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C 552.\n\n(l) Acceptance of service.

Information is of a commercial nature if it relates to commerce, trade, profit, or the Postal Service's ability to conduct itself in a businesslike manner.\n\n(i) When assessing whether information is commercial in nature, the Postal Service will consider whether the information:\n\n(A) Relates to products or services subject to economic competition, including, but not limited to, “competitive” products or services as defined in 39 U.S.C. 3631, an inbound international service, or an outbound international service for which rates or service features are treated as nonpublic;\n\n(B) Relates to the Postal Service's activities that are analogous to a private business in the marketplace;\n\n(C) Would be of potential benefit to individuals or entities in economic competition with the Postal Service, its customers, suppliers, affiliates, or business partners or could be used to cause harm to a commercial interest of the Postal Service, its customers, suppliers, affiliates, or business partners;\n\n(D) Is proprietary or includes conditions or protections on distribution and disclosure, is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or a third party has otherwise expressed an interest in protecting such information from disclosure;\n\n(E) Is the result of negotiations, agreements, contracts or business deals between the Postal Service and a business entity; or\n\n(F) Relates primarily to the Postal Service's governmental functions or its activities as a provider of basic public services.\n\n(ii) No one factor is determinative. Rather, each factor should be considered in conjunction with the other factors and the overall character of the particular information.

As a matter of policy, however, the Postal Service will normally make records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes available upon request unless the production of these records:\n\n(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n\n(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n\n(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority (such as the Postal Inspection Service) in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;\n\n(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or\n\n(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\n\n(2) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records that could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings, and\n\n(i) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and\n\n(ii) There is reason to believe that,\n\n(A) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and\n\n(B) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Postal Service may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n(3) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency (such as the Postal Inspection Service) under an informant's name or personal identifier are requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, the records may be treated as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.\n\n(4) Authority to disclose records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to persons outside the Postal Service must be obtained from the Chief Postal Inspector, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260-2100, or designee.\n\n(d) Disclosure of names and addresses of specifically identified Postal Service customers. Upon request, the names and addresses of specifically identified Postal Service customers will be made available only as follows:\n\n(1) Change of address.

If a domestic violence shelter has filed a letter on official letterhead from a domestic violence coalition stating:\n\n(i) That such domestic violence coalition meets the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 10410; and\n\n(ii) That the organization filing the change of address is a domestic violence shelter, the new address shall not be released except pursuant to applicable routine uses. The new address of any individual or family that has filed a permanent or temporary change of address order will be furnished only in those circumstances stated at paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Disclosure will be limited to the address of the specifically identified individual about whom the information is requested (not other family members or individuals whose names may also appear on the change of address order). The Postal Service reserves the right not to disclose the address of an individual for the protection of the individual's personal safety. Other information on PS Form 3575 or copies of the form will not be furnished except in those circumstances stated at paragraph (d)(5)(i), (d)(5)(iii), or (d)(5)(iv) of this section.\n\n(2) Name and address of permit holder. The name and address of the holder of a particular bulk mail permit, permit imprint or similar permit (but not including postage meter licenses), and the name of any person applying for a permit on behalf of a holder will be furnished to any person upon request. For the name and address of a postage meter license holder, see paragraph (d)(3) of this section. (Lists of permit holders may not be disclosed to members of the public. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)\n\n(3) Name and address of postage evidencing user. The name and address of an authorized user of a postage meter or PC Postage product (postage evidencing systems) printing a specified indicium will be furnished to any person upon the payment of any fees authorized by § 265.9(b), provided the user is using the postage meter or PC Postage product for business purposes. The request for this information must be sent to the manager of Postage Technology Management, Postal Service Headquarters. The request must include the original or a photocopy of the envelope or wrapper on which the postage meter or PC postage indicium in question is printed, and a copy or description of the contents to support that the sender is a business or firm and not an individual. (Lists of authorized users of postage meters or PC Postage products may not be disclosed to members of the public.)\n\n(4) Post Office boxholder information. Information from PS Form 1093, Application for Post Office Box or Caller Service, will be provided as follows:\n\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the boxholder applicant name and address from PS Form 1093 will be provided only in those circumstances stated in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.\n\n(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the names of persons listed as receiving mail, other than the boxholder applicant, will be furnished from PS Form 1093 only in those circumstances stated in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (iii) of this section.\n\n(iii) When a copy of a protective order has been filed with the postmaster, information from PS Form 1093 will not be disclosed except pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(5) Exceptions. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, names or addresses of specifically identified Postal Service customers will be furnished only as follows:\n\n(i) To a Federal, State or local government agency upon prior written certification that the information is required for the performance of its duties. The Postal Service requires government agencies to use the format appearing at the end of this section when requesting the verification of a customer's current address or a customer's new mailing address. If the request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return the request to the agency, specifying the deficiency in the space marked `OTHER'. A copy of PS Form 1093 may be provided.\n\n(ii)(A) To a person empowered by law to serve legal process, or the attorney for a party in whose behalf service will be made, or a party who is acting pro se,\n1\n upon receipt of written information that specifically includes all of the following:\n\n\n\n1 The term pro se means that a party is not represented by an attorney but by himself or herself.\n(1) A certification that the name or address is needed and will be used solely for service of legal process in connection with actual or prospective litigation;\n\n(2) A citation to the statute or regulation that empowers the requester to serve process, if the requester is other than the attorney for a party in whose behalf service will be made, or a party who is acting pro se;\n\n(3) The names of all known parties to the litigation;\n\n(4) The court in which the case has been or will be commenced;\n\n(5) The docket or other identifying number, if one has been issued; and\n\n(6) The capacity in which the boxholder is to be served, e.g., defendant or witness.\n\n(B) By submitting such information, the requester certifies that it is true. The address of an individual who files with the postmaster a copy of a protective court order will not be disclosed except as provided under paragraphs (d)(5)(i), (iii), or (iv) of this section. A copy of Form 1093 will not be provided. The Postal Service suggests use of the standard format appearing at the end of this section when requesting information under this paragraph. When using the standard format on the submitter's own letterhead, the standard format must be used in its entirety. The warning statement and certification specifically must be included immediately before the signature block. If the request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return it to the requester specifying the deficiency.\n\n(iii) In compliance with a subpoena or court order, except that change of address or boxholder information which is not otherwise subject to disclosure under these regulations may be disclosed only pursuant to a court order.\n\n(iv) To a law enforcement agency, for oral requests made through the Inspection Service, but only after the Inspection Service has confirmed that the information is needed in the course of a criminal investigation. (All other requests from law enforcement agencies should be submitted in writing to the postmaster as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.)\n\n(6) Jury service. The mailing address of any customer sought in connection with jury service, if known, will be furnished without charge upon prior written request to a court official, such as a judge, court clerk or jury commissioner.\n\n(7) Address verification. The address of a postal customer will be verified at the request of a Federal, State, or local government agency upon written certification that the information is required for the performance of the agency's duties. “Verification” means advising such an agency whether or not its address for a postal customer is one at which mail for that customer is currently being delivered. “Verification” neither means nor implies knowledge on the part of the Postal Service as to the actual residence of the customer or as to the actual receipt by the customer of mail delivered to that address. The Postal Service requires government agencies to use the format appearing at the end of this section when requesting the verification of a customer's current address or a customer's new mailing address. If the request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return the request to the agency, specifying the deficiency in the space marked “OTHER”.\n\n(8) Business/Residence location. If the location of a residence or a place of business is known to a Postal Service employee, whether as a result of official duties or otherwise, the employee may, but need not, disclose the location or give directions to it. No fee is charged for such information.\n\n(9) Private mailbox information. Information from PS Form 1583, Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent, will be provided as follows:\n\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of this section, information from PS Form 1583 will be provided only in the circumstance stated in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.\n\n(ii) To the public only for the purpose of identifying a particular address as an address of an agent to whom mail is delivered on behalf of other persons. No other information, including, but not limited to, the identities of persons on whose behalf agents receive mail, may be disclosed to the public from PS Form 1583.\n\n(iii) Information concerning an individual who has filed a protective court order with the postmaster will not be disclosed except pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(e) Information not available for public disclosure. (1) The Postal Service and its officers and employees shall not make available to the public by any means or for any purpose any mailing list or other list of names and addresses (past or present) of postal patrons or other persons in response to a request under this part except that, upon a request in accordance with the procedures of § 265.3, the Postal Service will, to the extent required by law, provide a listing of postal employees working at a particular postal facility.\n\n(2) Records or other documents which are classified or otherwise specifically authorized by Executive Order 12356 and implementing regulations to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.\n\n(3) Records consisting of trade secrets or confidential financial data, the disclosure of which is prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1905, are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.\n\n(4) Other records, the disclosure of which is prohibited by statute, are not subject to disclosure pursuant to this part.\n\n(f) Protection of the right of privacy. If any record required or permitted by this part to be disclosed contains the name of, or other identifying details concerning, any person, including an employee of the Postal Service, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the name or other identifying details shall be deleted before the record is disclosed and the requester so informed.\n\n(g) Disclosure in part of otherwise exempt record. Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided after deleting the information which is neither subject to mandatory disclosure nor available as a matter of discretion.\n\n\n\n[81 FR 86271, Nov. 30, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 12921, Mar. 8, 2017; 82 FR 32767, July 18, 2017; 83 FR 9433, Mar. 6, 2018; 83 FR 48236, Sept. 24, 2018]",

If, after the employee has entered upon the discharge of the duties of this non-postal office, his non-postal duties interfere with the proper discharge of postal duties, either by him or by other postal employees, the employee holding the non-postal office shall be advised by his superior to eliminate the interference, either by resignation from the non-postal office, or in such other manner as is appropriate under the circumstances. If the employee fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the foregoing advice and the interference continues, he will be subject to disciplinary proceedings. \n\n(d) Employees, other than postmasters or acting postmasters in a salary level of EAS-25 or higher, may be granted permission to campaign for a full-time State or local nonpartisan office while on annual leave or on authorized leave without pay during the campaign when: \n\n(1) The criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section are met, and \n\n(2) The Vice President, Area Operations, determines that the employee's postal responsibilities are being conducted in a satisfactory manner and that the absence of the employee during the campaign period will not disrupt the operation of the facility where he or she is employed. \n\n\nNote:\nRequests shall be submitted through the postmaster or other installation head to the Vice President, Area Operations. If the employee is elected to and takes such a full-time office, he or she may either be separated from the Postal Service or granted leave without pay.\n(e) A postmaster or acting postmaster in salary level EAS-25 or higher shall not be authorized to take annual leave or leave without pay for the purpose of campaigning for a full-time State or local nonpartisan office. \n\n[39 FR 1990, Jan. 16, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 48231, Oct. 18, 1983.

          "content": "§ 776.5   Review procedures.\nOfficials shall follow the decision-making process outlined in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, when a facility action may involve floodplain issues. Under certain circumstances, this process may be carried out with fewer steps if all objectives of the decision-making process can be achieved. A general principle underlying this process is that a postal facility action requiring construction in a floodplain may be considered only when there is no practicable alternative.\n\n(a) Analysis of alternatives. If a postal facility action would involve construction in a floodplain, alternative actions shall be considered.\n\n(b) Early public notice. If a facility action at the contending site(s) could require construction in a floodplain, public notice must be provided.\n\n(c) Floodplain location and information. (1) Personnel shall determine whether construction would occur within a floodplain. The determination shall be made by reference to appropriate Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain maps (sometimes referred to as Floodplain Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)), or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps, or more detailed maps if available. If such maps are not available, floodplain location must be determined based on the best available information.\n\n(2) Once the preferred site has been identified, potential floodplain impacts must be determined. As part of this determination process, specific floodplain information should be developed, which is to consider:\n\n(i) Whether the proposed action will directly or indirectly support floodplain development;\n\n(ii) Flood hazard and risk to lives and property;\n\n(iii) Effects on natural and beneficial floodplain values, such as water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge, and agriculture; and\n\n(iv) Possible measures to minimize harm to, or impact on, the floodplain.\n\n(d) Reevaluation. After the above steps have been followed, if the determination is that there appears to be no practicable alternative to constructing in a floodplain, a further review of alternatives must be conducted by the facilities organization in conjunction with the operations organization requesting the construction of the facility. The further review of alternatives must be conducted by the operations organization for projects within the delegated authority of the Vice President, Area Operations.\n\n(e) Final public notice. As a result of the reevaluation, if it is determined that there is no practicable alternative to constructing in a floodplain, public notice shall be provided as soon as possible for the proposed action. The notice should be publicized and should include:\n\n(1) Identification of the project's location;\n\n(2) Provision for a 30-day public commenting period before irrevocable action is taken by the Postal Service; and\n\n(3) Name and complete address of a postal contact person responsible for providing further information on the decision to proceed with a facility action or construction project in a floodplain. Upon request, that person shall provide further information as follows:\n\n(i) A description of why the proposed action must be located in a floodplain;\n\n(ii) A listing of alternative actions considered in making the determination; and\n\n(iii) A statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable state and local floodplain protection standards.\n\n(f) Distribution. The above public notice will be sent to appropriate officials, local newspapers, and other parties who express interest in the project.\n\n(g) NEPA coordination. If either an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment is required under the Postal Service's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the above review procedures must be incorporated into and evaluated in that document.",

Any lawful activity, except a farm operation, that is:\n\n(1) Conducted primarily for the purchase, sale, lease, and/or rental of personal and/or real property, and for the manufacturing, processing, and/or marketing of products, commodities, and/or any other personal property; or\n\n(2) Conducted primarily for the sale of services to the public; or\n\n(3) Solely for the purposes of reimbursing moving and related expenses, conducted primarily for outdoor advertising display purposes, when the display(s) must be moved as a result of the project; or\n\n(4) Conducted by a nonprofit organization that has established its nonprofit status under applicable Federal or State law.\n\n(c) Small business. A business having at least one but not more than 500 employees working at the location being acquired.\n\n(d) Comparable Replacement Dwelling. A dwelling which is:\n\n(1) Decent, safe, and sanitary.\n\n(2) Functionally similar to the displacement dwelling with particular attention to the number of rooms and living space.\n\n(3) In an area that is not subject to unreasonably adverse environmental conditions, is not generally less desirable than the location of the displacement dwelling with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities, and is reasonably accessible to the displaced person's place of employment.\n\n(4) On a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements including customary landscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, fences, swimming pools, and greenhouses.\n\n(5) Currently available to the displaced person.\n\n(6) Within the financial means of the displaced person.\n\n(e) Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling. A dwelling which meets local housing and occupancy codes and the following standards, unless they are waived for good cause by the Postal Service. The dwelling must:\n\n(1) Be structurally sound, weathertight, and in good repair.\n\n(2) Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other electrical devices.\n\n(3) Contain a heating system capable of sustaining a healthful temperature of approximately 70 degrees except in those areas where local climatic conditions do not require such a system.\n\n(4) Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and areas of living space needed to accommodate the displaced persons. There shall be a separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathroom that provides privacy to the user and contains a bathtub or shower stall, sink, and toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate sources of water and to a sewage drainage system. In the case of a housekeeping unit—as opposed to, for example, a room in a boarding house—there shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage draining system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and a refrigerator.\n\n(5) Contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level.\n\n(6) For displaced persons who are handicapped, be free of any barriers which would preclude their reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling.\n\n(f) Displaced Person. (1) Subject to the additional definitions, limitations and exceptions in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the term “displaced person” is defined as follows. (“Displaced persons” are entitled to receive benefits only as specifically provided for elsewhere in these regulations.)\n\n(i) A person who owns real property, and who is required to move or to move personal property from the real property following Postal Service action to obtain title to, or a leasehold interest in, such real property by the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain.\n\n(ii) A person who is a tenant and who is required to move or to move his or her personal property from real property:\n\n(A) Following Postal Service action to obtain the tenant's leasehold interest in such real property by the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, or,\n\n(B) Where the Postal Service acquires a fee interest in the property (including long-term leases of 50 years or more), as a result of a Postal Service notice of displacement or notice to vacate such real property, provided the tenant was lawfully in possession on the date title to such property transfers to the Postal Service. (The requirement that the tenant occupy such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by the Postal Service.)\n\n(C) Where such real property was used to construct a new building for the express purpose of leasing to the Postal Service under circumstances where such tenant would have been a “displaced person” hereunder had the Postal Service itself acquired the land and required the removal of the tenant to undertake construction of the building for Postal Service ownership.\n\n(iii) Where the Postal Service acquires either a fee interest or a leasehold interest in the property, a person who is a residential tenant and is or will be required to move or to move his or her property from the real property, in order for the Postal Service to accomplish the project for which the property was acquired, provided such tenant occupies such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service or the date the Postal Service leases or contracts to lease such property, and further provided such tenant was lawfully in possession at the time of the initiation of negotiations. (The requirement that the tenant occupy such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by the Postal Service.)\n\n(2) The term “displaced person” covers only persons meeting the requirements in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The term “displaced person” does not cover the following non-exclusive list of examples.\n\n(i) An owner who voluntarily sells his or her real property to the Postal Service, or, \n\n(ii) A tenant who voluntarily transfers his or her leasehold interest to the Postal Service without the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, or,\n\n(iii) A tenant who is not lawfully in possession at the times for which lawful possession is specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(B) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section. A tenant who was legally required by the lease or otherwise to have moved from the property at the times specified in such paragraphs shall not be considered to be lawfully in possession.\n\n(iv) A person who, at the determination of the Postal Service, is not required to relocate permanently, or,\n\n(v) A person who, after receiving a notice of displacement or notice to vacate by the Postal Service, is notified in writing that he or she will not be displaced. Such later notification shall not be issued if the person has already moved. If such latter notification is issued, the Postal Service shall reimburse the person for any reasonable expenses incurred to satisfy any binding contractual relocation obligations entered into after the effective date of the notice of displacement or the notice to vacate or,\n\n(vi) A person who is required to temporarily vacate the premises in order to permit fumigation, repair, painting, or other maintenance or code of enforcement work or, \n\n(vii) A tenant who is required to move from real property as a result of a notice from the Postal Service to vacate such real property where such notice to vacate is issued five years or more after the date of the acquisition of such real property. A tenant who is given a notice to vacate as a result of failure to comply with the terms of his/her lease with the Postal Service or failure to renew his/her lease under prevailing market conditions is not considered to be a displaced person.\n\n(viii) A mobile home occupant who owns the site on which the mobile home is located and who voluntarily sells the site to the Postal Service, regardless of whether such person owns or rents the mobile home.\n\n(ix) A person whose property is acquired through a “friendly condemnation action” where price is not an issue.\n\n(g) Displacement Dwelling. The dwelling acquired by the Postal Service from which a displaced person is required to move.\n\n(h) Dwelling. The place of permanent or customary and usual residence of a person including a single family house; a single family unit in a two-family, multi-family, or multi-purpose property; a unit of a condominium or cooperative housing project; a non-housekeeping unit (i.e., room in a boarding house); a mobile home; or any other residential unit.\n\n(i) Family. Two or more individuals who are related by blood, adoption, marriage, or legal guardianship who live together as a family unit. If the Postal Service considers that circumstances warrant, others who live together as a family unit may be treated as if they are a family for the purpose of determining assistance under these regulations.\n\n(j) Farm Operation. Any activity conducted solely or primarily for the production of one or more types of agricultural products or commodities, including timber, for sale or home use, and customarily producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be capable of contributing materially to the operator's support.\n\n(k) Financial Means. A comparable replacement dwelling is within the financial means of the displaced family or individual if the average monthly rental or housing cost (e.g., monthly mortgage payments, insurance for the dwelling unit, property taxes, and other reasonable recurring related expenses) which the displaced person will be required to pay does not exceed the greater of 25 percent of the monthly gross income of the displaced family or individual or the ratio of the present monthly rental or housing cost to the gross income of the displaced family or individual. (Supplemental payments made by public agencies are to be included in gross income for purposes of these comparisons.)\n\n(l) Initiation of Negotiations. In the case where eminent domain is neither exercised nor threatened to be exercised, the initiation of negotiations is the initial written communication stating a price by the owner or the owner's representative to the Postal Service, or by the Postal Service to the owner or the owner's representative, regarding a proposed acquisition (by purchase or lease) or an interest in a specific piece of real property. In the case where eminent domain is either exercised or threatened to be exercised, the initiation of negotiations is the date the Postal Service makes a written offer of just compensation.\n\n(m) Notice of Displacement. A notice given in writing by the Postal Service to a person that he or she will be displaced from his or her place of residence, business or farm, as a result of a facility action by the Postal Service. A notice of displacement may be combined with or in a notice to vacate.\n\n(n) Notice to Vacate. A notice given in writing by the Postal Service to a person that he or she is to vacate postal owned property on or before a certain date. A notice to vacate may be combined with or in a notice of displacement.\n\n(o) Owner of Displacement Dwelling. A person is considered to be an owner, if, at the initiation of negotiations, the person holds any of the following interests in real property acquired for a postal project:\n\n(1) Fee title, a life estate, a 99-year lease, or a lease, including any options for extension, with at least 50 years to run from the date of acquisition; or\n\n(2) An interest other than leasehold interest in a cooperative housing project which includes the right to occupy a dwelling; or\n\n(3) A contract to purchase any of the interests or estates described in paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section; or\n\n(4) Any other interest, including a partial interest, which in the judgment of the Postal Service, warrants consideration as ownership.\n\n(p) Person. Any individual, family, partnership, corporation, association, business or farm operation.\n\n(q) Personal Property. Any tangible property, not considered part of the real property, for which payment has not been included in the acquisition cost.\n\n(r) Tenant. A person who has the legal right to temporary use and occupancy of real property owned by another. In some cases, these regulations also use the term “tenant” to refer to a person who occupies real property owned by another but whose legal right was terminated due to a timely notice to vacate the real property used and occupied.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 10666, Mar. 15, 1989]",

When acquisition of a site under consideration would likely involve displacement of a person eligible under § 777.13 for relocation assistance, the Postal Service representative shall prepare a relocation needs and availability analysis. The Postal Service representative shall include in the analysis a complete inventory of persons who may be displaced and specifically identify their needs.\n\n(b) Planning Subsequent to Site Selection. Subsequent to site selection, the Postal Service must review the relocation needs and availability analysis and establish a specific plan for providing the assistance covered by these regulations to any eligible displaced persons. It will further determine the necessity of establishing an on-site relocation office which would be accessible to displaced persons and would be staffed with relocation personnel qualified to render all relocation services. The Postal Service will assure that cost estimates reflect current market conditions and that funding is available for all relocation assistance and activities.\n\n(c) Contracting for Relocation Services. When the Postal Service determines it to be advantageous, it may enter into a relocation assistance service contract with a public agency or private firm having expertise in relocation assistance. The contract must require the contractor to follow Postal Service relocation assistance regulations.\n\n(d) Notice to Vacate, Ninety Day Requirement. Postal Service notices to vacate must be issued at least 90 days prior to the date the property must be vacated. Any such notice must be in writing and delivered in person with receipt acknowledged, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The 90-day requirement does not apply to any such notice issued subsequent to a valid notice to vacate issued by the prior owner of the property. A 90-day notice may be given with, or such notice may be combined with, but such notice must not be given before, the notice of displacement referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(e) Shorter Notice Period, Unusual Circumstances. An occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the Postal Service determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable. An example of such a situation is when the person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to the person's health or safety.\n\n(f) Notice of Displacement. Normally, a notice of displacement will be given at the time of acquisition or later. Such notice must not be given earlier than the time of contracting, except in the case of acquisitions by eminent domain or by the threat of eminent domain. Such notice may be given at the time of contracting or between the time of contracting and the time of acquisition if the Postal Service considers it wise to start the displacement process then and if, in the judgment of the Postal Service, it is clear that person will in fact be a displaced person.\n\n(g) Notice of Availability of Advisory Services. The notice of displacement will state that relocation assistance advisory services will be available to the displaced person and will designate who will provide such services.\n\n(h) Eviction for cause. Any person occupying real property and not in unlawful occupancy on the date of initiation of negotiations is presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance unless the Postal Service determines that:\n\n(1) The person received an eviction notice prior to initiation of negotiations and, as a result of that notice, is later evicted; or\n\n(2) The person is evicted after initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement; and \n\n(3) In either case the eviction is not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make the relocation payments and other assistance available.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 10667, Mar. 15, 1989]",

The initial contact to provide relocation information must take place by the following dates:\n\n(1) Where acquisition of the property is to occur as a result of the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, at the time of initiation of negotiation or within 30 days thereafter.\n\n(2) In any other instance such contact must be made prior to acquisition and prior to the notice of displacement or the notice to vacate, but it should normally not be made prior to contracting for the acquisition.\n\n(d) Service to be Provided. The advisory program shall include such services as may be necessary or appropriate to:\n\n(1) Provide current information on the availability, purchase prices, financing, and rental costs of replacement dwellings.\n\n(2) For displaced persons eligible for replacement housing payments, explain that the displaced person cannot be required to move unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available.\n\n(i) At the request of the displaced person, the Postal Service must inform that person, in writing, of the specific comparable replacement dwelling used as the basis for the replacement housing payment offer, the price or rent used to establish the upper limit of that offer, the basis for the determination, and the amount of the replacement housing payment to which he or she may be entitled.\n\n(ii) Where feasible, housing must be inspected by the Postal Service representative prior to its being made available to assure that it is a comparable replacement dwelling and meets the decent, safe, and sanitary standard. The displaced person must be notified that a replacement housing payment will not be made unless the replacement dwelling is inspected and determined to be decent, safe, and sanitary.\n\n(iii) Whenever possible, minority displaced persons must be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require the Postal Service to provide a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable that person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling.\n\n(iv) All displaced persons, especially the elderly and handicapped, must be offered transportation to inspect housing to which they are referred.\n\n(3) Provide current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of comparable and suitable commercial and farm properties and locations, and assist any person displaced from a business or farm operation to obtain and become established in a suitable replacement location.\n\n(4) Minimize hardships to displaced persons in adjusting to relocation by providing counseling, advice about other sources of assistance that may be available, and such other help as may be appropriate.\n\n(5) Supply displaced persons with appropriate information concerning Federal, State, and local housing programs, disaster loan and other programs administered by the Small Business Administration, and other Federal, State, and local programs offering assistance to displaced persons.\n\n(6) Upon selection of a replacement property by a displaced person, the Postal Service may arrange for a representative to assist the displaced person with necessary arrangements for the move.",

Allowable moving expenses include:\n\n(1) Transportation of the displaced person and his or her personal property. Transportation costs are limited to the costs of a move up to a distance of 50 miles unless the Postal Service determines that relocation beyond 50 miles is justified.\n\n(2) Packing, crating, unpacking, and uncrating of the personal property.\n\n(3) Disconnecting, dismantling, removing, reassembling, and reinstalling relocated household appliances and other personal property.\n\n(4) Storage of the personal property not to exceed 12 months unless the Postal Service determines that a longer period is necessary.\n\n(5) Reasonable costs for insurance for the replacement value of the personal property being moved or stored.\n\n(6) When determined to be fair and reasonable by the Postal Service the replacement value of property lost, stolen, or damaged in the process of moving (not through the fault or negligence of the displaced person, his or her agent, or employee), but only where insurance covering such loss, theft, or damage is not reasonably available.\n\n(7) Other moving related expenses that are not listed as non-allowable under paragraph (l)(3) of this section and which the Postal Service determines to be reasonable and necessary.\n\n(c) Fixed payment for moving expenses. residential moves.

The payment will consist of the reasonable costs incurred in attempting to sell the item plus the lesser of:\n\n(i) The fair market value of the item for continued use at the displacement site, less the proceeds from its sale. (To be eligible for this payment the claimant must make a good faith effort to sell the personal property, unless the Postal Service determines that such effort is not necessary. When payment for property loss is claimed for goods held for sale, the fair market value must be based on the cost of the goods to the business, not the potential selling price.); or\n\n(ii) The estimated cost of moving the item no more than 50 miles, but with no allowance for storage.\n\n(8) If an item of personal property which is used as part of a business or farm operation is not moved, is promptly replaced with a substitute item that performs a comparable function at the replacement site, the displaced person is entitled to payment of the lesser of:\n\n(i) The cost of the substitute item, including installation costs at the replacement site, less any proceeds from the sale. (To be eligible for payments under paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the claimant must make a good faith effort to sell the personal property, unless the Postal Service determines that such effort is not necessary.)\n\n(ii) The estimated cost of moving and reinstalling the replaced item, based on the lowest acceptable bid or estimate obtained by the Postal Service for eligible moving and related expenses, but with no allowance for storage.\n\n(9) A displaced business or farm operation is entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses, not to exceed $1,000, which the Postal Service determines to be reasonable and which are incurred in searching for a replacement location. These expenses include transportation, meals and lodging away from home, time spent searching (based on reasonable salary or earnings) and fees paid to a real estate agent or broker to locate a replacement site, exclusive of any fees or commissions related to the purchase of such site.\n\n(10) Other moving-related expenses, not listed as non-allowable under paragraph (l)(3) of this section, which the Postal Service determines to be reasonable and necessary.\n\n(e) Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Business Moves. Any displaced business, other than an outdoor advertising display business, or a non-profit organization, is eligible for a fixed payment in lieu of actual moving and related expenses. This payment must be in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business at that location, as computed under paragraph (i) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine that:\n\n(1) The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move; and, the business vacates or relocates from its displacement site; and\n\n(2) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is assumed to meet this test unless the Postal Service determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage; and\n\n(3) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Postal Service, and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities.\n\n(4) The business contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement (see paragraph (h) of this section). However, the Postal Service may waive this test for good cause.\n\n(5) The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others.\n\n(f) Determining the Number of Businesses. In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities constitute a single business which is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which: \n\n(1) The same premises and equipment are shared;\n\n(2) Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;\n\n(3) The entities are held out to the public, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one business; and \n\n(4) The same person or closely related persons own, control, or manage the affairs of the entities.\n\n(g) Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Farm Operation. Any displaced farm operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine that the farm operation contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the two taxable years prior to the displacement (see paragraph (h) of this section). In the case of acquisition of land which was part of a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Postal Service determines that: \n\n(1) The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the operation on the remaining land; or \n\n(2) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.\n\n(h) Contributes materially. The term “contributes materially,” as used in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section means that, during the 2 taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Postal Service determines to be more equitable, a business or farm operation:\n\n(1) Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or\n\n(2) Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or \n\n(3) Contributed at least 33\n1/3 percent of the owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources. \n\n(4) If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Postal Service may approve the use of other criteria as determined appropriate.\n\n(i) Average Annual Net Earnings of a Business or Farm Operation. The average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation are one-half of its net earnings before Federal, State, and local income taxes during the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. If the business or farm was not in operation for the full 2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Postal Service determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, the owner's spouse, and dependents. The displaced person shall furnish the Postal Service proof of net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence which the Postal Service determines is satisfactory. \n\n(j) Nonprofit Organizations. Any displaced nonprofit organization may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount of $2,500, if the Postal Service determines that it:\n\n(1) Cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing patronage (membership or clientele). A nonprofit organization is assumed to meet this test, unless the Postal Service demonstrates otherwise; and \n\n(2) Is not part of an enterprise having at least one other establishment engaged in the same or similar activity which is not being acquired by the Postal Service.\n\n(k) Relocation of Outdoor Advertising Signs. The amount of a payment for direct loss of an advertising sign which is personal property is the lesser of:\n\n(1) The depreciated replacement cost of the sign, as determined by the Postal Service, less the proceeds from its sale; (To be eligible for payments under this paragraph (k)(1), the claimant must make a good faith effort to sell the sign, unless the Postal Service determines that such effort is not necessary.) or\n\n(2) The estimated cost of moving the sign, no more than 50 miles, but with no allowance for storage.\n\n(l) Payment for actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, nonresidential moves. In addition to the payments available as allowable expenses for nonresidential moves, a small business, farm or non-profit organization may be eligible to receive a payment, not to exceed $10,000 for expenses actually incurred in relocating and reestablishing such small business, farm or non-profit organization at a replacement site.\n\n(1) Allowable expenses. Reestablishment expenses must be reasonable and necessary, as determined by the Postal Service. They may include the following:\n\n(i) Repairs or improvements to the replacement real property as required by federal, state, local law, code or ordinance.\n\n(ii) Modifications to the replacement property to accommodate the business operation or make replacement structures suitable for occupancy.\n\n(iii) Construction and installation costs not to exceed $1,500 for exterior signing to advertise the business.\n\n(iv) Installation of security or fire protection devices.\n\n(v) Provision of utilities from right-of-way to improvements on the replacement site.\n\n(vi) Redecoration or replacement of soiled or worn surfaces at the replacement site, such as paint, panelling or carpeting.\n\n(vii) Licenses, fees and permits when not paid as part of the moving expenses.\n\n(viii) Feasibility surveys, soil testing and marketing studies.\n\n(ix) Advertisement of replacement location, not to exceed $1,500\n\n(x) Professional services in connection with the purchase or lease of a replacement site.\n\n(xi) Increased costs of operation during the first two years at the replacement site, not to exceed $5,000, for such items as lease or rental charges, personal or real property taxes, insurance premiums, utility charges including impact fees or one time assessments for anticipated heavy utility usage.\n\n(xii) Other items that the Postal Service considers essential to the reestablishment of the business.\n\n(2) Non-allowable expenses. Following is a non-exclusive listing of restablishment expenditures not considered to be reasonable, necessary or otherwise allowable.\n\n(i) Purchase of capital assets such as office furniture, filing cabinets, machinery, or trade fixtures.\n\n(ii) Purchase of manufacturing materials, production supplies, product inventory, or other items used in the normal course of the business operation.\n\n(iii) Interior or exterior refurbishment at the replacement site which are for cosmetic purposes only.\n\n(iv) Interest on money borrowed to make the move or purchase the replacement property.\n\n(v) Payment to a part-time business in the home which does not contribute materially to the household income.\n\n(vi) Payment to a person whose sole business at a replacement dwelling is the rental of such dwelling to others.\n\n(m) General Provisions—(1) Self moves. If the displaced person elects to take full responsibility for all or a part of the move, the Postal Service may approve a payment for the person's moving expenses in an amount not to exceed the lowest of three bids acceptable to the Postal Service. Bids may be obtained by either the displaced person or the Postal Service.\n\n(2) Transfer of Ownership. Upon request by the Postal Service and in accordance with applicable law, the displaced person may transfer to the Postal Service ownership of any personal property that is not to be moved, sold, or traded-in by executing a disclaimer of all rights or interest in the property.\n\n(3) Non-Allowable Expenses. Except as specifically otherwise provided herein, a displaced person is not entitled to payment for:\n\n(i) The cost of moving any structure or other real property improvement.\n\n(ii) Loss of goodwill.\n\n(iii) Loss of profits.\n\n(iv) Loss of trained employees.\n\n(v) Any additional operating expenses of a business or farm operation caused by operating in a new location.\n\n(vi) Personal injury.\n\n(vii) Any legal fee or other cost for preparing a claim for a relocation payment or for representing the displaced person before the Postal Service.\n\n(viii) Expenses for searching for a replacement dwelling.\n\n(ix) Costs for storage of personal property on real property owned or leased by the displaced person.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 48029, Dec. 17, 1987; 54 FR 10667, Mar. 15, 1989]",

Such displaced persons may alternately choose the benefits under paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(2) Residential displaced persons who lawfully and continuously owned and occupied, and residential displaced persons who were tenants and lawfully and continuously occupied, a displacement dwelling for not less than 90 days prior to the initiation of negotiations are entitled to the benefits set out in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(3) Where the replacement housing payment provided hereunder does not provide for housing within the financial means (see § 777.13(j)) of the displaced person, see § 777.27, Last Resort Housing.\n\n(b) Benefits for 180 Day Owner Occupants. Displaced persons eligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are entitled to benefits as set out below:\n\n(1) An amount which is the sum of:\n\n(i) The amount which must be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:\n\n(A) The reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling as determined by paragraph (c) of this section; or\n\n(B) The purchase price of a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person; plus\n\n(ii) Interest Cost (see paragraph (d) of this section); plus\n\n(iii) Incidental Expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section).\n\n(2) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are limited to a maximum payment of $22,500.\n\n(3) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are available only if a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased within 12 months after the latter of:\n\n(i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited in a court for the displaced person's benefit, or\n\n(ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.\n\n(c) Determining the Cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. The cost of a comparable replacement dwelling for purposes of benefits to be paid to 180 day owner occupants will be determined by applying the following:\n\n(1) If available, at least three representative comparable replacement dwellings must be examined and the payment offer computed on the cost of the fair market value of the dwelling most closely comparable to the displacement dwelling.\n\n(2) To the extent, feasible, comparable replacement dwellings will be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement dwelling was located. If this is not possible, comparable replacement dwellings will be selected from nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are similar.\n\n(d) Increased Mortgage Interest Costs. The amount to be paid to a displaced 180 day owner occupant for increased mortgage interest costs is the amount, if any, by which the present value of the interest on the mortgage loan(s) on the replacement dwelling plus any other debt service costs exceeds the present value of the interest on the mortgage loan(s) on the displacement dwelling plus purchaser's points and loan origination fees, subject to the following:\n\n(1) The payment must be based only on bona fide mortgages that were a valid lien on the displacement dwelling for at least 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations. All such mortgages on the displacement dwelling must be used to compute the payment.\n\n(2) The payment must be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling or the new mortgage amount, whichever is less.\n\n(3) The payment must be based on the remaining term of the mortgage on the displacement dwelling or the actual term of the new mortgage, whichever is shorter.\n\n(4) The new mortgage must be a bona fide mortgage and its interest rate must not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently charged by mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement dwelling is located.\n\n(5) The discount rate used to compute the present value of the increased interest cost must be the prevailing interest rate paid on demand savings deposits by commercial banks in the area in which the replacement dwelling is located.\n\n(6) Purchaser's points and loan origination fees, but not seller's points, are reimbursable to the extent they are not paid as incidental expenses, they do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the area, and the Postal Service determines them to be necessary. The computation of such points and fees shall be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling, or the new mortgage amount, whichever is less.\n\n(e) Benefits for 90 Day Owner Occupant and Tenants. Displaced persons eligible under paragraph (a)(2) of this section are entitled to benefits as set out below:\n\n(1) Rental assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (f) of this section or downpayment assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(2) The benefits in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, are limited to $5,250.\n\n(3) The benefits in (e)(1) above are available only if a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased or rented within 12 months after the latter of:\n\n(i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited in the court for the displaced person's benefit, or\n\n(ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.\n\n(f) Rental Assistance. The rental assistance benefits, not to exceed $5,250, for 90 day owner occupants and tenants will be computed as follows:\n\n(1) The amount which must be added to 42 times the average monthly rental paid at the displacement dwelling (or, if the displaced person is an owner occupant, the fair market rental value had the displacement dwelling been rented) for the three-month period prior to displacement to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:\n\n(i) 42 times the reasonable monthly rental of a comparable replacement dwelling; or \n\n(ii) 42 times the actual monthly rental cost of the decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling actually rented and occupied by the displaced person.\n\n(2) If utilities are included in either the replacement dwelling or the displacement dwelling rent, appropriate utilities must be factored into both rentals. If utilities are not included in either monthly rental then the payment will be computed using the base rental rates.\n\n(3) If, in the opinion of the Postal Service, the monthly rental at the displacement dwelling is significantly below the fair market rent of the displacement dwelling, such fair market rent must be used in computing the rental assistance payment.\n\n(4) The payment under this section must be disbursed in a lump-sum amount unless the Postal Service determines on a case-by-case basis, for good cause, that the payment should be made in installments. Where the rental assistance payment exceeds $5,250 under the provisions of Last Resort Housing, (§ 777.27), installment payments or payments through escrow accounts may be considered.\n\n(g) Downpayment assistance. Downpayment assistance, not to exceed $5,250, is available to 90 day owner occupants and 90 day tenants. This $5,250 amount may be considered to include the full amount of the required downpayment and incidental expenses.\n\n(h) Incidental Expenses. Incidental expenses covered under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) or (g) of this section are those reasonable costs actually incurred by the displaced person incident to the purchase of a replacement dwelling and customarily paid by the buyer (not to exceed the costs of such for a comparable replacement dwelling). They include: \n\n(1) Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title search and insurance, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees.\n\n(2) Lender, FHA, or VA appraisal fees.\n\n(3) FHA or VA application fee.\n\n(4) Certification of structural soundness when required by the lender.\n\n(5) Credit report.\n\n(6) Owner's and mortgagee's evidence or assurance of title. \n\n(7) Escrow agent's fee.\n\n(8) State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes.\n\n(9) Such other costs as the Postal Service determines to be incidental to the purchase.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 48029, Dec. 17, 1987]",

          "content": "§ 777.25   Additional rules for replacement housing payments.\n(a) Multiple Owners. When a single family dwelling is owned by more than one person and occupied by only some of the 180 day owners (for example, when the dwelling is owned by an estate and only one of the heirs is in occupancy), the occupant(s) is (are) eligible to receive a maximum total price differential which is the lesser of:\n\n(1) The difference between (i) the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling, as determined under § 777.24(c) and (ii) the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling; or \n\n(2) The difference between (i) the occupant's share of the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling and (ii) the purchase price of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person.\n\n(b) Multiple Occupants of One Displacement Dwelling. If two or more occupants of the displacement dwelling move to separate replacement dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, as determined by the Postal Service, of any relocation payments that would have been made if the occupants moved together to a comparable replacement dwelling. However, if the Postal Service determines that two or more occupants maintained separate households within the same dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments.\n\n(c) Mixed Use and Multi-Family Properties Acquired. If the displacement dwelling was part of a property that contained another dwelling unit or space used for non-residential purposes, or if it is located on a lot larger than that typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the acquisition payment which is actually attributable to the displacement dwelling and site can be considered its acquisition cost when computing the price differential.\n\n(d) Disaster-Related Insurance Proceeds. To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds received by a person in connection with a disaster related loss to the displacement dwelling must be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling when computing the price differential.\n\n(e) Inspection of Replacement Dwelling. Before making a replacement housing payment or releasing a payment from escrow, the Postal Service must inspect the replacement dwelling and determine that it is a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling.\n\n(f) Purchase of Replacement Dwelling. A displaced person is considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement dwelling if the person has purchased an existing dwelling; purchased and rehabilitated or moved and restored an existing dwelling; or constructed a new dwelling, provided in each instance the dwelling is determined to be decent, safe and sanitary.\n\n(g) Conversion of Payment. A displaced person who initially rents a replacement dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment may, within the required 12 month eligibility period, purchase a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling. In such case, he or she is eligible to revise his or her original claim, and claim any additional assistance for which he or she was originally eligible. However, any portion of the rental assistance payment that has been disbursed must be deducted from the resultant replacement housing payment or downpayment assistance payment.\n\n(h) Payment After Death. A replacement housing payment is personal to the displaced person. Upon his or her death, the undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except that:\n\n(1) The amount attributable to the displaced person's period of actual occupancy of the replacement housing will be paid.\n\n(2) The full payment must be disbursed in any case in which a member of a displaced family dies and other family members continue to occupy the replacement dwelling selected in accordance with these regulations.\n\n(3) Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the selection of a replacement dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased person must be disbursed to the estate.\n\n(i) 180 Day Owner Retention of Displacement Dwelling. If a 180 day owner occupant retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to move his or her dwelling from the displacement site, and he or she moves it and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the cost of the actual replacement dwelling to be computed for purposes of § 777.24(b)(1)(i)(A) (not to exceed the purchase price of a comparable replacement dwelling) will be the sum of:\n\n(1) The expenses of moving and restoring the retained dwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move; and\n\n(2) The salvage or other value deducted from the acquisition cost for the retained ownership; and\n\n(3) Additional costs, if necessary, incurred to make the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; and\n\n(4) The cost of the replacement site, not to exceed the cost of a comparable available and suitable replacement site.\n\n(j) 90 Day Owner/Retention of Displacement Dwelling. A 90 day owner occupant who retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to remove his or her dwelling may receive the benefits as if he or she were a 180 day owner occupant subject, however, to a limitation of $5,250 on maximum benefits in lieu of the $22,500 limitation set out in paragraph § 777.24(b)(2).\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 10668, Mar. 15, 1989]",

Displaced persons who are occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving expenses under § 777.23 subject to the following:\n\n(1) If the person owns the mobile home, moving expenses may, at the owner's option, include any reasonable costs incurred to move the mobile home to a replacement site, plus the reasonable cost of disassembling, moving, and reassembling any attached appurtenances (such as porches, decks, skirting, and awnings) which were not acquired, anchoring of the unit, and utility “hook-up charges.”\n\n(2) If the person rents the mobile home, the Postal Service may allow the person moving expense benefits for moving the mobile home as if the person were an owner of the mobile home under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n(3) If costs of moving a mobile home are paid as moving expenses under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the person may not receive housing assistance benefits hereunder, other than any benefits to which they are entitled that are limited to the site of the mobile home.\n\n(4) Displaced occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving expenses for personal property other than the mobile home and its appurtenances, but only to the extent the Postal Service does not pay the costs of moving the mobile home (either as moving expenses or replacement housing payments or, if it does pay such costs, the personal property is of a type that is customarily moved separately from the mobile home.)\n\n(b) Replacement Housing Payments. Displaced persons who are 180 day or 90 day occupants of mobile homes qualify for replacement housing payments under § 777.24 subject to the following:\n\n(1) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and owns the site, the person is eligible for benefits under either § 777.24 (b) or (e).\n\n(2) If the displaced person rents the mobile home and rents the site the person is eligible for benefits under § 777.24(e).\n\n(3) If the displaced person rents the mobile home and owns the site the person is eligible for benefits under § 777.24(e), with regard to the mobile home and to benefits under § 777.24(b) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on the home and site benefits combined of $22,500. (Persons who voluntarily sell mobile home sites are not displaced persons and are not entitled to benefits under Subpart B. See § 777.13(e)(2)(viii)).\n\n(4) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and rents the site the person is eligible for benefits under either § 777.24 (b) or (e) with regard to the mobile home and to benefits as a tenant under § 777.24(e) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on home and site benefits combined of $5,250.\n\n(c) Special Rules for Mobile Homes. (1) In computing replacement housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this section, apply the terms of § 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.\n\n(2) The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remainder that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. When the Postal Service determines that its acquisition of the real property has had this effect and that for this reason a mobile home occupant located on the remaining part of the property is required to move, such occupant shall be considered a displaced person under these regulations and shall be entitled to such benefits hereunder as the person would otherwise qualify.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 48029, Dec. 17, 1987]",

A displaced person cannot be required to move from his or her dwelling unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available to him or her which is within his or her financial means. When such comparable replacement dwelling is not available, additional measures may be taken to provide for “last resort” housing for eligible displaced persons.\n\n(b) Basic Rights of Persons to be Displaced. The provisions of this section do not deprive any displaced person of any rights the person may have under these regulations such as the right to accept the maximum replacement housing payment available under these regulations and to move to a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling even if such dwelling is beyond the person's financial means.\n\n(c) Methods of Providing Replacement Housing. The Postal Service has broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation must be on a reasonable cost basis. The Postal Service may provide last resort housing using the following methods:\n\n(1) Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement dwelling.\n\n(2) The construction of a new replacement dwelling.\n\n(3) The provision of a direct loan which requires regular amortization or deferred repayment. Terms of such loan will be at the discretion of the Postal Service.\n\n(4) A replacement housing payment in excess of the $5,250 and $22,500 limitations contained in § 777.24. A rental subsidy under this section may be provided in installments.\n\n(5) The relocation and any needed rehabilitation of a replacement dwelling.\n\n(6) The purchase or lease of land and/or a replacement dwelling by the Postal Service and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with, a displaced person.\n\n(7) The removal of barriers to the handicapped.\n\n(8) Any other method determined by the Postal Service to be reasonable.\n\n(d) Proof of Financial Need. Last Resort Housing benefits exceeding the limitations under § 777.24(b)(2) and § 777.24(e)(2) will not be paid unless required to provide housing within the displaced person's financial means. To establish financial means, the displaced person must furnish the Postal Service proof of gross monthly income through income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable evidence which the Postal Service determines is satisfactory.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 48029, Dec. 17, 1987]",

The relocation representative should assist eligible displaced persons in the preparation of claims for moving assistance and relocation housing assistance. Preliminary review should be conducted in the field by the relocation representative with the displaced person, to preclude technical difficulties in processing the claim at a higher level.\n\n(b) Documentation. Any claim for a relocation payment must be supported by such documentation as may be required to support the claim, for example the length of occupancy at the displacement dwelling, the rent paid at the displacement dwelling, expenses incurred in relocating, etc. A displaced person must be provided reasonable assistance to complete and file any required claim.\n\n(c) Time for Filing. All claims must be filed with the Postal Service within 18 months after the date of the actual move from the displacement property.\n\n(d) Review, Approval and Payment. The Postal Service will review claims within 60 days of submission and approve or disapprove payment. Upon approval or partial approval of the displaced person's claim, the Postal Service will promptly authorize payment of the approved amount. The certification that the claimant has occupied decent, safe, and sanitary housing must be completed prior to final payment of replacement housing payments.\n\n(e) Relocation Payments Not Considered as Income. Upon approval of the claim and delivery of the relocation payment, the displaced person must be advised that no relocation payment made under these procedures shall be considered as income for the purpose of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or for the purpose of determining the eligibility or the extent of eligibility of any person for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal Law.\n\n(f) Certification. Certification that a person is displaced will be provided any agency requiring such information to assist that person under any Federal law or program.\n\n(g) Advance of Funds. If the displaced person cannot arrange for the acquisition of a replacement property because of financial problems and the problems would be solved by an advance of funds, the Postal Service may determine the estimated amount of the actual claim and authorize an advance of that amount or a portion thereof. The displaced person will be fully informed in writing that his or her final claim will then be subject to adjustment. Advance payments should not be made to persons with a history of financial irresponsibility.\n\n(h) Money Owed to the Postal Service. In cases of Postal Service leasing the acquired property to a displaced persons, or in cases of advance moving cost payments, any monies due the Postal Service by the displaced person and not paid before the remainder of the relocation payments are made must be deducted from such payments and the relocation file so documented. \n\n(i) Notice of Denial of Claim. If the Postal Service disapproves all or part of a payment claimed, of refuses to consider the claim on its merits because of untimely filing or other grounds, it must promptly notify the claimant in writing of the determination, the basis for the determination, and the procedures for appealing the determination.\n\n(j) Appeal Procedure. If a displaced person wishes to file an appeal:\n\n(1) The appeal must be in writing.\n\n(2) The appeal must be directed to the General Manager, Real Estate Division, and must set forth the displaced person's reasons for the appeal. (The General Manager shall not have taken part in the decision which led to the appeal. Appeals misdirected to others must be forwarded immediately to the General Manager with notification of the forwarding to the appellant.)\n\n(3) The appeal must be submitted within 60 days after the displaced person receives written notification of the Postal Service's original determination concerning the displacee's claim. The Postal Service may extend this time limit for good cause.\n\n(k) Right of Representation. A displaced person has a right to be represented by legal counsel or other representative in connection with his or her appeal, but solely at the person's own expense.\n\n(l) Review of Files by Appellant. The Postal Service must permit a person to inspect and copy all materials pertinent to his or her appeal, except materials which are confidential. Such inspection will be permitted as allowed under the Freedom of Information Act, 39 CFR Part 265.\n\n(m) Scope of Review. In deciding an appeal, the Postal Service must consider all pertinent justification and other material submitted by the displaced person and all other available information that is needed to ensure a fair and full review of the appeal.\n\n(n) Determination and Notification After Appeal. Promptly after receipt of all supporting information submitted by the appellant, the General Manager, Real Estate Division, must make a written determination on the appeal, including the basis on which the decision was made, and furnish the appellant a copy. If the full relief requested is not granted at the Service Center level, the General Manager, Real Estate Division, must advise the person of his or her right to appeal the decision to the Director, Office of Real Estate. The rules stated here for appeals to the General Manager apply as well as to appeals to the Director, Office of Real Estate.\n\n[51 FR 6983, Feb. 27, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 10668, Mar. 15, 1989]",

          "content": "§ 777.31   Acquisition procedures.\n(a) Policy; Application of Section. The Postal Service, as a matter of policy, acquires interests in real property through voluntary agreements with owners. Only under unusual and compelling circumstances, and on a case-by-case basis, does the Postal Service acquire real property through the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain. This policy does not, however, prevent the Postal Service from occasionally entering into mutually agreeable condemnation proceedings with an owner, where price is not an issue, and for such purposes as to clear title or to acquire property from certain elected officials. For the purposes of this section, the Postal Service does not consider such voluntary and mutually agreeable uses of condemnation proceedings as the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain. The following regulations apply only to acquisitions by the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain:\n\n(1) Notice to Owner. As soon as feasible after deciding to acquire a specific property through the exercise of eminent domain, the Postal Service must notify the owner of its intent to acquire the property.\n\n(2) Expeditious Negotiations. The Postal Service must make every reasonable effort to acquire real property expeditiously by negotiation.\n\n(3) Appraisal and Invitation to Owner. Before the initiation of negotiations, the real property shall be appraised in accordance with Postal Service appraisal standards as outlined in RE-1 and the owner or the owner's designated agent shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.\n\n(4) Establishment of Offer of Just Compensation. Prior to the initiation of negotiations (see § 777.13(k) for definition) the Postal Service must establish an amount which it believes is just compensation for the real property rights be acquired. The amount must not be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value, including damages or benefits to the remaining property. Appraisers shall not give consideration to, or include in their real property appraisals, any allowances for the benefits provided by title II of the Act.\n\n(5) Summary Statement. Promptly after determining fair market value, the Postal Service shall make a written offer to acquire the property for the full amount believed to be just compensation. Along with the written purchase offer, the owner must be given a written statement of the basis for the offer of just compensation. This statement must include:\n\n(i) A statement of the amount offered as just compensation. In the case of a partial acquisition, the compensation for the real property to be acquired and the compensation for damages, if any, must be separately stated.\n\n(ii) The location and description of the real property and the interest(s) to be acquired.\n\n(iii) An identification of the buildings, structures, and other improvements (including removable building equipment and trade fixtures) which are considered part of the real property for which the offer of just compensation is made. Where appropriate, the statement shall identify and separately held ownership interest in the improvement(s), for example, a tenant-owned improvement.\n\n(6) Basic Negotiation Procedures. The Postal Service must make every reasonable effort to contact the owner or the owner's representative and:\n\n(i) Discuss the Postal Service's offer to purchase the property including the basis for the offer of just compensation, and;\n\n(ii) Explain Postal Service acquisition policies and procedures including the provisions for the payment of incidental expenses as described under § 777.33.\n\n(7) Opportunity to Consider Offer. The owner must be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the Postal Service's offer, to present material which he or she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property, and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Postal Service must consider the owner's presentation. \n\n(8) Updating Offer of Just Compensation. If the information presented by the owner or a material change in the character or condition of the property indicates the need for new appraisal information, or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the appraisal(s) of the property, the Postal Service must have the appraisal(s) updated or obtain a new appraisal(s). If the latest appraisal information indicates that a change in the purchase offer is warranted, the Postal Service must promptly reestablish just compensation and offer the revised amount to the owner in writing. \n\n(9) Contracts and Options. Contracts to purchase shall cover only those items related to the acquisition of the property, and not incorporate provisions for making payments for relocation costs or related costs under title II of these regulations. \n\n(10) Title II Benefits Not To Be Considered. In the event of condemnation, estimated compensation shall be determined solely on the basis of the appraised value of the real property with no consideration being given to or reference contained therein to the payments to be made under title II. \n\n(11) Coercive Action. The Postal Service shall not advance the time of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation, or the deposit of funds with the court, or take any other coercive action in order to induce an agreement on the price to be paid for the property. \n\n(12) Inverse Condemnation. If the Postal Service intends to acquire any interest in real property by exercise of the power of eminent domain, it must institute formal condemnation proceedings and not intentionally make it necessary for the owner to institute proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property. \n\n(13) Payment Before Taking Possession. Before requiring the owner to surrender possession of the real property, the Postal Service must either: \n\n(i) Pay the agreed purchase price to the owner; or \n\n(ii) In the case of a condemnation proceeding, deposit with the court for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the amount of the approved appraised value of the property or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property. \n\n(14) Right-of-Entry. With the prior approval of the owner, the Postal Service may obtain a right-of-entry before making payment to the owner.",

However, the Postal Service will not pay costs solely required to perfect the owner's title to the real property. \n\n(2) Penalty costs and other charges for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage, entered into in good faith, encumbering the real property. \n\n(3) The pro rata portion of any prepaid real property taxes which are allocable to the period after the Postal Service obtains title to the property or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier. \n\n(b) Direct Payment. Whenever feasible the Postal Service must pay these costs directly and thus avoid the need for an owner to pay such costs and then seek reimbursement from the Postal Service. \n\n(c) Certain Litigation Expenses. The owner of the real property acquired must be reimbursed any reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees which the owner actually incurred because of a condemnation proceeding if: \n\n(1) The final judgment of the court is that the Postal Service cannot acquire the real property by condemnation; or \n\n(2) The condemnation proceeding is abandoned by the Postal Service other than under an agreed-upon settlement; or \n\n(3) The court having jurisdiction renders a judgment in favor of the owner in an inverse condemnation proceeding or the Postal Service effects a settlement of such a proceeding.",

The applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B and must submit additional information to verify its eligibility upon order by the adjudicative officer.\n\n(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:\n\n(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;\n\n(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees; \n\n(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;\n\n(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and\n\n(5) Any other partnerships, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.\n\n(c) For the purposes of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated, which in proceedings before the Board of Contract Appeals is the date the applicant files its appeal to the Board. \n\n(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.\n\n(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.\n\n(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.\n\n(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.\n\n[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987]",

No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Postal Service pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.\n\n(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:\n\n(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;\n\n(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;\n\n(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;\n\n(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and\n\n(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.\n\n(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.\n\n[46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6798, Mar. 5, 1987; 66 FR 55577, Nov. 2, 2001]",

          "content": "§ 3006.200   Procedures for submitting requests.\n(a) Electronic submission requirements. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is submitted electronically. An electronic request may be submitted via the Commission's online FOIA request form that is accessible through the Commission's website (https://www.prc.gov), emailing FOIA@prc.gov, or the web portal at https://www.foia.gov/. Each electronic request must:\n\n(1) Reasonably describe the records sought;\n\n(2) Identify the request category under § 3006.301; and\n\n(3) Include the requester's name, daytime telephone number, and a valid email or mailing address to receive records and written communications from the Commission regarding the request.\n\n(b) Hard copy submission requirements. A requester may also submit a request for records via hard copy. Each hard copy request must:\n\n(1) Be in writing;\n\n(2) Be clearly identified as “Freedom of Information Act Request” both in the text of the request and on the envelope;\n\n(3) Be submitted to the Commission's office (901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001);\n\n(4) Reasonably describe the records sought; and\n\n(5) Include the requester's name, daytime telephone number, and a valid email or mailing address to receive records and written communications from the Commission regarding the request.\n\n(c) Content of request. Each request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Commission personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should include specific information about each record sought that might assist the Commission in responding to the request, such as the type of record (e.g., contract, report, memorandum, etc.); the title or docket number of a specific document or report; the topic or subject matter; the name of the office and/or employees most likely to possess the record; the date or general timeframe of the record's creation; and any details related to the purpose of the record. Requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. Before submitting requests, a requester may contact the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) or the FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records sought and to receive assistance in describing the records. The request may also specify the requester's preferred method of communication (telephone, email, or mailing address) and the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the requested records.\n\n(d) Improper requests. A request that does not reasonably describe the records sought or does not comply with the published rules regarding the procedures to be followed for submitting a request will be deemed to be an improper FOIA request. If the Commission does not receive the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will administratively close the file.\n\n(1) If after receiving a request, the Commission determines that it is improper, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will provide one written notification to the requester using the contact information included in the request. The notification will inform the requester of all the following:\n\n(i) The reason(s) why the request is improper;\n\n(ii) The additional information needed from the requester that would reasonably describe the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort;\n\n(iii) The Commission will not be able to comply with the request unless the Commission receives such additional information in writing within the specified timeframe and if the Commission does not receive a written response containing the additional information needed within the specified timeframe, then it will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and will administratively close the file on the request;\n\n(iv) The preferred method for the requester to provide the additional information is by emailing FOIA@prc.gov;\n\n(v) The requester may also provide the additional information by mailing or by hand delivery during regular business hours (which are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, except for Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) to the Office of Secretary and Administration, Postal Regulatory Commission, 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001); and\n\n(vi) The contact information for the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) and the FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.\n\n(2) If the requester provides the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort by the timeframe specified in the notification, then the Commission will confirm receipt of the information and process the request.\n\n(3) After administrative closure, if the Commission receives the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will notify the requester that the request will be processed as a new request.\n\n(e) Expedited processing. At any time, a requester that has satisfied all applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may seek expedited processing of a request or an administrative appeal. To seek expedited processing, the requester must:\n\n(1) Include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” in the body of the submission;\n\n(2) For any hard copy submission, include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” on the envelope;\n\n(3) Demonstrate a compelling need as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v); and\n\n(4) Certify the statement of compelling need to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief.

(1) Unless expedited processing has been granted, the Commission places each request in simple or complex tracks based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors considered in assigning a request into the complex track may include one or more of the following:\n\n(i) The request involves voluminous documents;\n\n(ii) The complexity of the material;\n\n(iii) The request involves record searches at multiple facilities or locations;\n\n(iv) The request requires consultation among the Commission or other agencies; or\n\n(v) The number of open requests submitted by the same requester.\n\n(2) Within each track, the Commission processes requests in the order in which they are received. When appropriate, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will notify the requester of placing a request in the “Complex” track and provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request. If the requester limits the scope of the request, it may result in faster processing.\n\n(c) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve the following:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.\n\n(2) Within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will notify the requester of the decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will inform the requester of the denial in writing, the right to appeal the denial to the Commission in writing, and the procedures for appealing the denial. Any request for records that has been denied expedited processing will be processed in the same manner as a request that did not seek expedited processing.\n\n(3) Where a compelling need is not shown in an expedited request as specified in § 3006.200(e), the Commission may grant the request for expedited processing at its discretion.\n\n(d) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances”, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and the Commission extends the time limit on that basis, the Commission shall, before the expiration of the 20 business day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. If an extension will exceed 10 business days, the Commission will:\n\n(1) Provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing; and\n\n(2) Make its FOIA Public Liaison available to the requester and apprise the requester of their right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.\n\n(e) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Commission may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a single requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Multiple requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.",

To the extent practicable and unless the request indicates a different preferred method of communication, the Commission will communicate with the requester electronically (such as via email). In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Commission shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to the request.\n\n(b) Acknowledgments of requests. The Commission shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) to process. The acknowledgment must include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to keep track of their requests more easily.\n\n(c) Grants of requests. Once the Commission makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester in writing. The Commission also shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Commission must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.\n\n(d) Adverse determinations of requests. If the Commission makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, then the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.\n\n(e) Content of denials. The denial shall be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee and shall include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the Commission in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 3006.203, and a description of the requirements; and\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.\n\n(f) Markings on released documents. Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.\n\n(g) Use of record exclusions. (1) If the Commission identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Commission must confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.\n\n(2) Upon invoking an exclusion, the Commission must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of exclusion by OIP.",

The Commission (on its own initiative) may review any decision of the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee within 90 calendar days.\n\n(b) Requirements for making an appeal. A requester may appeal an adverse decision on their FOIA request rendered by the Commission by submitting a hard copy to the Commission's office (901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001) or by emailing FOIA@prc.gov. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the Commission's response. To facilitate handling, the requester must mark both the appeal letter and envelope or the subject line of the electronic transmission “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” The appeal must include, as applicable:\n\n(1) A copy of the request, of any notification of denial or other action, and of any other related correspondence;\n\n(2) The FOIA tracking number assigned to the request;\n\n(3) A description of the action (or failure to act) which is being challenged;\n\n(4) If challenging specific redactions made to responsive records, a statement identifying the specific redactions being challenged;\n\n(5) A statement of the relief sought; and\n\n(6) A statement of the reasons why the requester believes the action or failure to act is erroneous.\n\n(c) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The decision of the Commission constitutes the final decision on the issue being appealed. The Commission will give prompt consideration to an appeal for expedited processing of a request. All other decisions normally will be made within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the time of the receipt by the Commission. The 20-business day response period may be extended by the Commission for a period not to exceed an additional 10 business days when reasonably necessary to permit the proper consideration of an appeal, under one or more of the “unusual circumstances”, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii). The aggregate number of additional business days used, however, may not exceed 10 business days.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Commission must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.\n\n(d) Decisions on appeals. A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds the adverse determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the adverse determination is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified in writing and the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will further process the request in accordance with that appellate decision and respond directly to the requester. If not prohibited by or under law, the Commission may direct the disclosure of a record even though its disclosure is not required by law or regulation.\n\n(e) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Commission agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n(f) When an appeal is required. Before seeking judicial review of an adverse determination rendered by the Commission on a FOIA request, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.",

Request for records of individuals which may not be granted under the Privacy Act shall be considered under FOIA.\n\n(1) If the Commission makes a disclosure in response to a request and the disclosure is permitted by the Privacy Act's disclosure provision, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), the Commission will rely on the Privacy Act to govern the disclosure.\n\n(2) In some circumstances, the Privacy Act may prohibit the Commission's ability to release records which may be released under FOIA.\n\n(d) Requesting a Postal Service record. The Commission maintains custody of records that are both Commission and Postal Service records. Except when the Postal Service submits materials to the Commission in connection with activities under 39 U.S.C. 407(b)(2)(A), in all other instances that the Postal Service submits materials to the Commission that the Postal Service reasonably believes to be exempt from public disclosure, the Postal Service shall follow the procedures described in part 3011, subpart B of this chapter.\n\n(1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for Postal Service records shall be referred to the Postal Service; and\n\n(2) A request made pursuant to part 3011 of this chapter for records designated as non-public by the Postal Service shall be considered under the applicable standards set forth in that part.\n\n(e) Requesting a record submitted by a person other than the Postal Service. The Commission maintains records of a confidential nature submitted by persons other than the Postal Service as non-public materials.\n\n(1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for records submitted by a person other than the Postal Service shall adhere to the applicable procedures of § 3006.205. If such a FOIA request is not referred to a different Federal agency pursuant to § 3006.205(b), the Commission shall consider it in light of all applicable exemptions and in accordance with the following procedures:\n\n(i) If such materials are designated as non-public, the Commission shall follow the procedures appearing in § 3006.206(b) through (d) in determining the FOIA request; or\n\n(ii) In all other instances, the Commission shall determine the FOIA request after notifying the person of the FOIA request and providing the person with an opportunity to respond within 7 days of the date of the notice under the following circumstances:\n\n(A) The records sought contain confidential commercial information that may be protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); and\n\n(B) The Commission determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided that at least one of the following applies:\n\n(1) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); or\n\n(2) The Commission has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.\n\n(2) A request made pursuant to part 3011 of this chapter for records designated as non-public by a person other than the Postal Service shall be considered under the applicable standards set forth in that part.",

          "content": "§ 3006.205   Consultations, referrals, and coordinations.\n(a) Consultations. If records originated with the Commission but contain within them information of significance to another Federal agency or office, the Commission will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.\n\n(b) Referrals. In addition to referring all requests made pursuant to FOIA for Postal Service records to the Postal Service as specified by § 3006.204(d)(1), if the Commission believes that a different Federal agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Commission will typically refer responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. Whenever the Commission refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the Commission will notify the requester of the referral, including the name of the agency and that agency's FOIA contact information.\n\n(c) Coordinations. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the Federal agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Commission locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Commission will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on disclosure of the record. The Commission then will notify the requester of the release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination.\n\n(d) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the Commission will determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the Commission must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the Commission must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(e) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by the Commission will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.\n\n(f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The Commission may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.",

Except as provided in § 3006.204(d), if a FOIA request seeks materials designated as non-public materials, the Commission will provide the submitter with notice of the request. The Commission may also provide notice when it has reason to believe that materials submitted by a person other than the Postal Service are possibly exempt from disclosure and may fall within the scope of any FOIA request.\n\n(c) Objections to disclosure. A submitter may file written objections to the request specifying all grounds for withholding the information under FOIA within 7 days of the date of the notice. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice, the submitter will be considered to have no objection, beyond those objections articulated in its application for non-public treatment pursuant to § 3011.201 of this chapter, to the disclosure of the information.\n\n(d) Notice of decision. If, after considering the submitter's objections to disclosure the Commission decides to disclose the information, it will give the submitter written notice of the decision and a brief explanation of the reasons for not sustaining the submitter's objections. The actual disclosure will not be made before 3 days after publication of the Commission's decision.",

In determining the applicability of this term, the use to which a requester will put the document is considered first; where reasonable doubt exists as to the use, the Commission may seek clarification before assigning the request to a category.\n\n(b) Direct costs means the expenditures the Commission incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, where applicable, reviewing documents to respond to a request. They include (without limitation) the salary of the employee(s) performing work (the basic pay rate of such employee(s) plus 16 percent to cover benefits).\n\n(c) Duplication means copying the documents necessary to respond to a request. Such copies may be paper, microform, audiovisual, or machine-readable.\n\n(d) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate or undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\n(e) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution, not operated on a commercial basis (as referenced above), which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\n(f) Representative of the news media means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or by subscription or by free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all inclusive and may include alternate media to disseminate news. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity (e.g., by a publication contract or prior publication record), whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity.\n\n(g) Review means examining documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion is exempt from disclosure, and processing or preparing documents for release, but not determination of general legal or policy issues regarding application of exemptions.\n\n(h) Search includes all time spent looking for material responsive to a request, including identification of pages or lines within documents.

The Commission will not review interlocutory rulings of a presiding officer except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n(b) Appeals certified by the presiding officer. (1) Rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed to the Commission when the presiding officer certifies in writing that an interlocutory appeal is warranted. The presiding officer shall not certify an appeal unless the officer finds that:\n\n(i) The ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and\n\n(ii) An immediate appeal from the ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.\n\n(2) A request for the presiding officer to certify an appeal shall be made by motion within five days after the presiding officer's ruling has been issued. The request shall set forth with specificity the reasons that a participant believes that an appeal meets the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. Such requests shall also state in detail the legal, policy, and factual arguments supporting the participant's position that the ruling should be modified. If the appeal is from a ruling rejecting or excluding evidence, such request shall include a statement of the substance of the evidence which the participant contends would be adduced by the excluded evidence and the conclusions intended to be derived therefrom.\n\n(3) The presiding officer may request responsive pleadings from other participants prior to ruling upon the request to certify an appeal to the Commission.\n\n(c) Appeals not certified by the presiding officer. A participant may request Commission review of a presiding officer's decision denying certification of an appeal by motion within five days of the decision. If the presiding officer fails to act on a request for certification within 15 days of the issuance of the ruling in question, the participant seeking certification may apply for review by the Commission within 20 days of the ruling in question. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, its review of the application for review will be based on the record and pleadings filed before the presiding officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(d) Action by the Commission. (1) The Commission may dismiss an appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that:\n\n(i) The objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's consideration of the entire proceeding; or\n\n(ii) Interlocutory review is otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(2) When the presiding officer declines to certify an appeal, the Commission will not permit an interlocutory appeal unless it determines:\n\n(i) That the presiding officer should have certified the matter;\n\n(ii) That extraordinary circumstances exist; and\n\n(iii) That prompt Commission decision is necessary to prevent grave detriment to the public interest.\n\n(3) If the Commission fails to issue an order permitting an interlocutory appeal within 15 days after the presiding officer certifies the appeal or a participant files an application for review, the appeal shall be deemed denied. If the Commission issues an order permitting an appeal, it may rule upon the merits of the appeal in that order or at a later time.\n\n(e) Effect of appeals. Unless the presiding officer or the Commission so orders, the certification of an appeal or the filing of an application for review shall not stay the proceeding or the effectiveness of any ruling.\n\n(f) Review at conclusion of proceeding. If the Commission does not entertain an interlocutory appeal of a presiding officer's ruling, objection to the ruling may be raised:\n\n(1) In briefs to the presiding officer or the Commission at the conclusion of hearings on the record; or\n\n(2) By the deadline for submission of comments or reply comments, whichever is later, in all other proceedings in which a hearing on the record is not held.",

          "content": "§ 3010.125   Library references.\n(a) In general. A library reference is a special type of filing, which is accepted by the Commission for the convenience of the person filing material that is not conducive to typical text based filings. The filing of a document as a library reference is appropriate when interest in the material is limited, when the material constitutes a secondary source that provides background or support for a position or matter, or when references to, or identification of, the material filed as a library reference would be facilitated. Examples of materials that are appropriate for filing as library references include electronic spreadsheets, workpapers in support of primary documents, pre-existing materials, secondary sources such as books or materials that are not readily available elsewhere, or other foundational materials filed in support of a primary document. Whenever possible, library references are to be filed in electronic format. The Commission reserves the right to refuse acceptance of any library reference material in its docket room and its right to take other action to ensure all persons' ability to obtain access to the material.\n\n(b) Categorization of library references. To the extent possible, material filed as a library reference shall be identified and referred to by participants in terms of the following categories:\n\n(1) Category 1—Reporting Systems Material (consisting of library references relating to the Postal Service's statistical cost and revenue reporting systems, and their primary outputs);\n\n(2) Category 2—Witness Foundational Material (consisting of material relating to the testimony of specific witnesses, primarily that which is essential to the establishment of a proper foundation for receiving into evidence the results of studies and analyses);\n\n(3) Category 3—Reference Material (consisting of previously published material provided for the convenience of the reader, such as books, chapters or other portions of books, articles, reports, manuals, handbooks, guides, and contracts);\n\n(4) Category 4—Material Provided in Response to Discovery (consisting of material provided in response to discovery requests);\n\n(5) Category 5—Disassociated Material (consisting of material filed at the request of another, from which the filing party wishes to be disassociated, is not vouching for or sponsoring the material provided);\n\n(6) Category 6—All Other Material (consisting of library references not fitting any of the other categories).\n\n(c) Labeling. Material filed as a library reference shall be labeled in a manner consistent with standard Commission notation and any other conditions the Commission or presiding officer establishes. Each library reference shall be identified by a unique identification number. The standard format for an identification number shall be “[abbreviated name of person filing]-LR-[docket identification]-[optional: NP][sequential number by person filing].” For example, “PRC-LR-CP2010-1-NP8” read right to left would be the eighth (8) non-public (NP) item filed in Docket No. (CP2010-1) as a library reference (LR) by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC). Alternative formats may be used when required for clear identification of the material being filed.\n\n(d) Filing procedure. Participants filing material as a library reference shall file contemporaneous written notice of this action. The notice shall:\n\n(1) Set forth the reason(s) why the material is being designated as a library reference;\n\n(2) Identify the category into which the material falls and describe in detail what the material consists of or represents, noting matters such as the presence of survey results;\n\n(3) Explain in detail how the material relates to the participant's case or to issues in the proceeding;\n\n(4) Identify authors or others materially contributing to substantive aspects of the preparation or development of the library reference;\n\n(5) Identify the documents (such as testimony, exhibits, and an interrogatory) or request to which the library reference relates, to the extent practicable;\n\n(6) Identify other library references or testimony relied upon or referred to in the designated material, to the extent practicable;\n\n(7) Indicate whether the library reference is an update or revision to another library reference and, if it is, clearly identify the predecessor material; and\n\n(8) To the extent feasible, for proceedings scheduled for a hearing on the record, identify portions expected to be entered into the record and the expected sponsor (if the participant filing a library reference anticipates seeking, on its own behalf, to enter all or part of the material contained therein into the evidentiary record). To the extent feasible, in all other proceeding types, identify portions relevant to the proceeding.\n\n(e) Optional preface or summary. Inclusion of a preface or summary in a library reference addressing the matters set out in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8) of this section is encouraged, but optional.",

Any interested person may become a party to proceedings docketed for a hearing on the record by filing a notice of intervention. The Postal Service, and the Public Representative are automatically deemed parties in such proceedings without the need to file a notice of intervention. Persons who file a complaint are also automatically deemed a party to a complaint proceeding without the need to file a notice of intervention. Parties may be provided an opportunity to participate in discovery, file testimony, participate in the written or oral examination of witnesses, file briefs, or present oral argument before the Commission or the presiding officer. Persons that have not intervened may participate in a proceeding docketed for a hearing on the record, but such participation shall be limited to providing comments pursuant to § 3010.140 unless otherwise directed.\n\n(b) Notices of intervention. A notice of intervention shall clearly and concisely set forth the nature and extent of the intervenor's interest in the issues to be decided, including the postal services utilized by the intervenor giving rise to the intervenor's interest in the proceeding, and to the extent known, the position of the intervenor with regard to the proposed changes in postal rates, fees, classifications, or services, or the subject matter of the complaint, as described in the notice of the proceeding. Such notice shall state whether or not the intervenor requests a hearing or in lieu thereof, a conference, and whether or not the intervenor intends to actively participate in a hearing. Such notice shall also include on page one thereof the name and full mailing address of no more than two persons who are to receive service, when necessary, of any documents relating to such proceeding.\n\n(c) Form and time of filing. Notices of intervention shall be filed no later than the date fixed for such filing by the Commission or its Secretary, unless for good cause shown, the Commission authorizes a late filing. Without a showing for good cause, late intervenors shall be subject to and may not challenge decisions by the Commission or presiding officer made prior to acceptance of the request for late intervention.\n\n(d) Oppositions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, oppositions to notices of intervention may be filed by any party in the proceeding no later than ten days after the notice of intervention is filed.\n\n(2) Oppositions to notices of interventions in proceedings considering the change in the nature of a postal service pursuant to part 3020 of this chapter may be filed by any party in the proceeding no later than three days after the notice of intervention is filed.\n\n(3) Pending Commission action, an opposition to intervention shall, in all proceedings except those considering the change in the nature of a postal service pursuant to part 3020 of this chapter, delay on a day-for-day basis the date for responses to discovery requests filed by that intervenor.\n\n(e) Effect of intervention. A person filing a notice of intervention shall be a party to the proceeding subject, however, to a determination by the Commission, either in response to an opposition, or sua sponte, that party status is not appropriate under the Act. Intervenors are also subject to the right of the Commission or the presiding officer as specified in § 3010.104 to require two or more intervenors having substantially like interests and positions to join together for purposes of service of documents, presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections, propounding discovery, cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral arguments to the Commission or presiding officer. No intervention shall be deemed to constitute a decision by the Commission that the intervenor is aggrieved for purposes of perfecting an appeal of any final order of the Commission.",

When an officer or an attorney acting in a representative capacity appears in person, submits a document to the Commission using the Filing Online system as a principal account holder, or signs a paper filed with the Commission, the personal appearance, online submission, or signature, shall constitute a representation to the Commission that that individual is authorized to represent the particular person on whose behalf the individual acts. Any individual appearing before or transacting business with the Commission in a representative capacity may be required by the Commission or the presiding officer to file evidence of the individual's authority to act in such capacity.\n\n(c) Notice of appearance and withdrawal of appearance. An individual intending to appear before the Commission or its presiding officer in a representative capacity in a proceeding before the Commission shall file with the Commission a notice of appearance in the form prescribed by the Secretary unless that individual is named in an initial filing of the person whom the individual represents as the individual to whom communications from the Commission in regard to the filing are to be addressed. An individual whose authority to represent a person in a specific Commission proceeding has been terminated shall file a timely notice of withdrawal of appearance with the Commission.\n\n(d) Standards of conduct. Individuals practicing before the Commission shall conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners by the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\n(e) Disqualification and suspension. After hearing, the Commission may disqualify and deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing and practicing before it in any way to any individual who is found not to possess the requisite qualifications, or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. Contumacious conduct at any hearing before the Commission or its presiding officer shall be grounds for exclusion of any individual from such hearing and for summary suspension for the duration of the hearing by the Commission or the presiding officer.",

The Commission or the presiding officer, if one has been appointed, may direct the parties in a proceeding to appear for a prehearing conference for the purposes of considering all possible ways of expediting the proceeding, including those in paragraph (e) of this section. Prehearing conference procedures shall be rigorously pursued by all parties.\n\n(b) Who presides. The presiding officer, if one has been designated, shall preside over prehearing conferences. If a presiding officer has not been designated or is otherwise unavailable for a prehearing conference, then the ranking Commissioner in attendance shall be considered the presiding officer for that conference. The presiding officer shall open and close each prehearing conference session and shall be responsible for controlling the conduct of the conference.\n\n(c) Informal off-the-record procedures. In order to make the prehearing conference as effective as possible, the presiding officer may direct that conferences be held off the record, without the presiding officer present. Informal off-the-record conferences shall be presided over by the Public Representative or such other person as the parties may select. At off-the-record conferences, parties shall be expected to reach agreement on those matters, which will expedite the proceeding, including the matters specified in the notice of the prehearing conference, in the ruling of the presiding officer directing that the off-the-record conference be held, and in paragraph (e) of this section. A report on the results of off-the-record conferences shall be made to the presiding officer on the record at a time specified by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall then determine the further prehearing procedures, if any, to be followed.\n\n(d) Required preparation and cooperation of all parties. All parties in any proceeding before the Commission are required and expected to come to prehearing conferences fully prepared to discuss in detail and resolve all matters, such as those specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in the notice of the prehearing conference, and in such other notice or agenda as may have been issued by the Commission or the presiding officer. All parties are required and expected to cooperate fully at all stages of the proceeding to achieve these objectives through thorough advance preparation for the prehearing conference, including informal communications between the parties, requests for discovery and appropriate discovery procedures at the earliest possible time and no later than at the prehearing conference, and the commencement of preparation of evidence and cross-examination. The failure of any party to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise any matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at the prehearing conference shall not be permitted to unduly delay the progress of the proceeding and shall constitute a waiver of the rights of the party with regard thereto, including all objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer with regard thereto.\n\n(e) Matters to be pursued. At the prehearing conference, the presiding officer and the parties shall consider and resolve such matters as:\n\n(1) The definition and simplification of the issues, including any appropriate explanation, clarification, or amendment of any proposal, filing, evidence, complaint or other pleading filed by any party;\n\n(2) Arrangements for timely completion of discovery from the Postal Service or any other party of information regarding any issues in the proceeding, prior filings, evidence or pleadings of any party;\n\n(3) Procedures for timely discovery with regard to any future evidentiary filings of any party;\n\n(4) Stipulations, admissions or concessions as to evidentiary facts, and agreements as to documentary matters, exhibits and matters of official notice, which will avoid unnecessary proof or dispute;\n\n(5) The possible grouping of parties with substantially like interests for purposes of presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections, cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument to the Commission or presiding officer;\n\n(6) Disclosure of the number, identity and qualifications of witnesses, and the nature of their testimony, particularly with respect to the policies of the Act and, as applicable according to the nature of the proceeding;\n\n(7) Limitation of the scope of the evidence and the number of witnesses in order to eliminate irrelevant, immaterial, or cumulative and repetitious evidence;\n\n(8) Procedures to direct and control the use of discovery prior to the hearing and submission of written testimony and exhibits on matters in dispute so as to restrict to a bare minimum the amount of hearing time required for oral cross-examination of witnesses;\n\n(9) Division of the proceeding where practicable into two or more phases for separate and, if advisable, simultaneous hearings;\n\n(10) Establishment of dates for the submission and service of such written testimony and exhibits as may be appropriate in advance of the hearing;\n\n(11) The order of presentation of the evidence and cross-examination of witnesses so that the hearing may proceed in the most expeditious and orderly manner possible; and\n\n(12) All other matters which would aid in an expeditious disposition of the proceeding, including consent of the parties to the conduct of the entire proceedings off the record.\n\n(f) Rulings by presiding officer. (1) The presiding officer at a prehearing conference, shall, irrespective of the consent of the parties, dispose of by ruling:\n\n(i) Any of the procedural matters itemized in paragraph (e) of this section; and\n\n(ii) Such other procedural matters on which the presiding officer is authorized to rule during the course of the hearing if ruling at this stage would expedite the proceeding.\n\n(2) Either on the record at the conclusion of such prehearing conference, or by order issued shortly thereafter, the presiding officer shall state the agreements reached by the parties, the actions taken, and the rulings made by the presiding officer. Such rulings shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings unless modified during the hearing to prevent manifest injustice.",

A public hearing may be held if a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding or if the Commission determines that a hearing is in the public interest.

The scheduling order may be combined with any other order or ruling that the Commission or the presiding officer may issue. The scheduling order may be periodically modified as warranted.\n\n(b) Content of scheduling order. The content of the scheduling order shall be tailored to the specifics of the matter before the Commission, including any requirement for a public hearing. The Commission or the presiding officer shall consider scheduling the following:\n\n(1) A deadline for conclusion of discovery on proponent's direct case;\n\n(2) A deadline to request oral cross-examination of proponent's witnesses;\n\n(3) A deadline for designation of written cross-examination on proponent's direct case;\n\n(4) The time and date for a public hearing on proponent's direct case, or the date and procedures for entering a proponent's direct case into evidence in a hearing by written submission of material only;\n\n(5) A deadline for parties other than the proponent to file testimony in support of, or in rebuttal to, the proponent's direct case;\n\n(6) A deadline for conclusion of discovery on testimony supporting or rebutting the proponent's direct case;\n\n(7) A deadline to request oral cross-examination of other parties' witnesses;\n\n(8) A deadline for designation of written cross-examination on other parties' testimony;\n\n(9) The time and date for a public hearing on other parties' testimony, or the date and procedures for entering other parties' testimony in a hearing by written submission of material only;\n\n(10) A deadline for the proponent to file surrebuttal testimony to other parties' direct cases;\n\n(11) A deadline for conclusion of discovery on any proponent's surrebuttal rebuttal testimony;\n\n(12) A deadline to request oral cross-examination of proponent's surrebuttal witnesses;\n\n(13) A deadline for designation of written cross-examination on proponent's surrebuttal testimony;\n\n(14) The time and date for a public hearing on a proponent's surrebuttal testimony, or the date and procedures for entering a proponent's surrebuttal testimony in a hearing by written submission of material only;\n\n(15) A deadline for filing briefs;\n\n(16) A deadline for filing reply briefs; and\n\n(17) A deadline for requesting oral argument.\n\n(c) Witness availability. Parties shall promptly file notice of potential witness unavailability to appear at any public hearing as soon as known. Witness unavailability will be considered when establishing the initial, or any subsequent, procedural schedules. Once the initial scheduling order is issued, but no later than ten calendar days prior to a scheduled hearing, parties may file notice of preferences for dates and times of witness appearance at any public hearing.\n\n(d) Subsequent scheduling of public hearings. At the adjournment of any public hearing (including prehearing conferences), the Commission, or the presiding officer if appointed, shall announce when the hearing will reconvene. If an announcement is not made, the Commission or the presiding officer shall announce the time, date, and location of the subsequent hearing, or prehearing conference in writing by notice, order, or presiding officer ruling.",

In general, discovery against a party will be scheduled to end prior to the receipt into evidence of that party's direct case. An exception to this procedure shall operate in all proceedings set for hearing when a party needs to obtain information (such as operating procedures or data) available only from the Postal Service. Such discovery requests are permissible only for the purpose of the development of rebuttal testimony and may be made up to 20 days prior to the filing date for final rebuttal testimony.\n\n(b) The discovery procedures set forth in §§ 3010.311 through 3010.313 are not exclusive. Parties are encouraged to engage in informal discovery whenever possible to clarify exhibits and testimony. The results of these efforts may be introduced into the record by stipulation, by supplementary testimony or exhibit, by presenting selected written interrogatories and answers for adoption by a witness at the hearing, or by other appropriate means. In the interest of reducing motion practice, parties also are expected to use informal means to clarify questions and to identify portions of discovery requests considered overbroad or burdensome.\n\n(c) If a party or an officer or agent of a party fails to obey an order of the Commission or the presiding officer to provide or permit discovery pursuant to §§ 3010.311 through 3010.313, the Commission or the presiding officer may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others, may direct that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the claim of the parties obtaining the order, or prohibit the disobedient party from introducing designated matters in evidence, or strike the evidence, complaint or pleadings or parts thereof.",

In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, any party may propound to any other party in a proceeding written, sequentially numbered interrogatories, by witness, requesting non-privileged information relevant to the subject matter and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in such proceeding, to be answered by the party served, who shall furnish such information as is available to the requesting party. A party through interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as a witness at the hearing and to state the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify. The party propounding the interrogatories shall file them with the Commission and serve them on the answering party. Follow-up interrogatories to clarify or elaborate on the answer to an earlier discovery request may be filed after the initial discovery period ends. They must be filed within seven days of receipt of the answer to the previous interrogatory unless extraordinary circumstances are shown.\n\n(b) Answers. Answers to discovery requests shall be prepared so that they can be incorporated as written cross-examination. Each answer shall begin on a separate page, identify the individual responding and the relevant testimony number, if any, the party who asked the question, and the number and text of the question. Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. The party responding to the interrogatories shall file the answers with the Commission and serve them on the requesting party within 14 days of the filing of the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing.\n\n(c) Objections. In the interest of expedition, the grounds for every objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If an objection is made to part of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A party claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A party claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the Commission or presiding officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing conference or other later time. Objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within ten days of the filing of the interrogatories. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless excused by the Commission or presiding officer for good cause shown.\n\n(d) Motions to compel responses to discovery. Motions to compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an objection was interposed, should be filed within 14 days of the answer or objection to the discovery request. The text of the discovery request, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to the motion to compel. Parties who have objected to interrogatories which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to answer. Answers will be considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial objection.\n\n(e) Compelled answers. The Commission, or the presiding officer, upon motion of any party to the proceeding, may compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an objection has been raised if the objection is overruled, or may compel an additional answer if the initial answer is found to be inadequate. Such compelled answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the compelling party within seven days of the date of the order compelling an answer or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing.\n\n(f) Supplemental answers. The individual or party who has answered interrogatories is under the duty to seasonably amend a prior answer if the individual or party obtains information upon the basis of which the individual or party knows that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. Parties shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. Parties filing supplemental answers shall indicate whether the answer merely supplements the previous answer to make it current or whether it is a complete replacement for the previous answer.\n\n(g) Orders. The Commission or the presiding officer may order that any party or person shall answer on such terms and conditions as are just and may for good cause make any protective order, including an order limiting or conditioning interrogatories, as justice requires to protect a party or person from undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or expense.",

In complaint proceedings under section 3662 of the Act, the complainant shall be considered the proponent. The proponent also shall be provided an opportunity to respond to any rebuttal to the proponent's direct case. In all other instances, the Commission or the presiding officer shall determine the order of presentation.\n\n(2) The order of presentations by parties other than the proponent shall be determined by the Commission or the presiding officer.\n\n(3) The Commission or presiding officer shall announce the order of presentation of parties and individual witnesses prior to hearing sessions and shall issue such other procedural orders as may be necessary to assure the orderly and expeditious conclusion of the hearing. Parties may present their preferences for order of appearance to the Commission or the presiding officer orally at a hearing or by filing a notice prior to the scheduled hearing date. Parties who disagree with a proposed order of appearances may move for a revised order of appearances either orally at a hearing or by filing a written motion pursuant to § 3010.160.\n\n(f) Swearing in of witnesses. (1) Witnesses attending a hearing whose testimony is to be taken shall be sworn, or shall affirm, before their testimony shall be deemed evidence in the proceeding or any questions are put to them. The witness shall be sworn by means of the following (or an equivalent): “Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear (or affirm), that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Please state your full name.”\n\n(2) The oath shall be given upon the first appearance of the witness providing testimony. Upon subsequent appearances, the witness is to be reminded by the presiding officer that the witness remains under oath for the duration of the proceeding.\n\n(3) Witnesses not attending a hearing whose testimony is entered by counsel during a hearing shall attach a signed declaration that the testimony being submitted is that of the witness. A declaration shall be included with each piece of written testimony, and each set of written cross-examination. The declaration shall state the following (or an equivalent): “Declaration of [witness name]. I, [witness name], hereby declare under penalty of perjury that: The [testimony, designated responses to written cross-examination] filed under my name were prepared by me or under my direction; and were I to [provide oral testimony, respond orally to the questions appearing in the interrogatories], my answers would be the same.”\n\n(4) Hearings that are conducted by the written submission of testimony only shall also attach written declarations to testimony and cross-examination as described above.\n\n(g) Presentation of the evidence—(1) Presentations by parties. Each party shall have the right to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses (limited to testimony adverse to the party conducting the cross-examination), and to present objections, motions, and arguments. The case-in-chief of parties other than the proponent shall be in writing and shall include the party's direct case and rebuttal, if any, to the initial proponent's case-in-chief. A party's presentation may be accompanied by a trial brief or legal memoranda. Legal memoranda on matters at issue are generally welcome at any stage of the proceeding. Parties will be given an opportunity to rebut presentations of other parties, including an opportunity for the initial proponent to present surrebuttal evidence. New affirmative matter (not in reply to another party's direct case) should not be included in rebuttal testimony or exhibits. When objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence before the Commission or the presiding officer are made, the grounds relied upon shall be stated. Formal exceptions to rulings are unnecessary.\n\n(2) Written testimony. (i) Written testimony shall be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a hearing, or in writing when the hearing is conducted by the written submission of testimony only. When a party moves to enter testimony into the record, three hard copies of the document shall simultaneously be submitted to the Commission for the record. The copies are to be printed single-sided, and not stapled, hole-punched, or bound, but may be fastened together by paper or binder clip, or equivalent.\n\n(ii) Witnesses shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the written testimony they are sponsoring is their testimony and that it would be the same if given orally. The witness, or counsel, shall state the original filing date of the testimony and identify all subsequent filings that amended the original testimony. If there are any final corrections to the testimony, the corrections may be noted on the hard copies submitted to the Commission. However, the witness shall be required to file errata to the testimony within seven days of the hearing, making corrections only to the extent as identified during the hearing. Any other changes shall be requested separately by motion to amend the record.\n\n(iii) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or part of a witness's written testimony prior to entering that testimony into the record. Objections that have not previously been made in writing at least 14 days prior to the hearing date shall be granted only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n(iv) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the testimony entered into the record as evidence. Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, the written testimony shall not be copied into the hearing transcript.\n\n(3) Library references. (i) Library references sponsored by a witness and associated with the witness's written testimony or written cross-examination may be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a public hearing, or in writing for a hearing that is conducted by the written submission of testimony only.\n\n(ii) Witnesses shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the library reference is their library reference and to affirm that they are in fact sponsoring the library reference. If a witness inadvertently fails to verify and affirm that the witness is sponsoring a library reference that is cited in written testimony or in response to written cross-examination, it will be presumed that the library reference is to be included in the record to the extent specified in the notice of the filing of the library reference.\n\n(iii) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or any part of the library reference being entered into the record. Objections that have not been made in writing at least 14 days prior to the hearing date shall be granted only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n(iv) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the library reference be entered into the record as evidence. Unless ordered by the presiding officer, library references shall not be copied into the hearing transcript.\n\n(4) Written cross-examination. (i) Written cross-examination will be utilized as a substitute for oral cross-examination whenever possible, particularly to introduce factual or statistical evidence. Written cross-examination may be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a public hearing, or in writing for a hearing that is conducted by the written submission of testimony only. Written cross-examination proposed by parties other than the party associated with the witness shall be considered first, followed by that of the party of the witness.\n\n(ii) Designations of written cross-examination should be filed with the Commission and served on the answering party no later than three working days before the scheduled appearance of a witness. Designations shall identify every item to be offered as evidence, listing the party who initially posed the discovery request, the witness and/or party to whom the question was addressed (if different from the witness answering), the number of the request and, if more than one answer is provided, the dates of all answers to be included in the record. (For example, “PR-T1-17 to USPS witness Jones, answered by USPS witness Smith (March 1, 1997) as updated (March 21, 1997)).” When a party designates written cross-examination, three hard copies of the documents to be included shall simultaneously be submitted to the Secretary. The documents are to be printed single-sided, and not stapled, hole-punched, or bound, but may be fastened together by paper or binder clip, or equivalent. The Secretary shall prepare for the record a packet containing all materials designated for written cross-examination in a format that facilitates review by the witness and counsel.\n\n(iii) A witness shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the written cross-examination is that of the witness and to assert that if the written cross-examination were being provided orally at the hearing it would be that of the witness. If there are any final corrections to the written cross-examination, the corrections may be noted on the hard copies before submission to the Commission.\n\n(iv) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or any part of the written cross-examination prior to entering the testimony into the record.\n\n(v) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the written cross-examination entered into the record as evidence. The presiding office shall direct that the written cross-examination be copied into the hearing transcript.\n\n(5) Oral cross-examination. (i) Oral cross-examination will be permitted for clarifying written cross-examination and for testing assumptions, conclusions, or other opinion evidence.\n\n(ii) Notices of intent to conduct oral cross-examination should be filed three or more working days before the announced appearance of the witness and should include specific references to the subject matter to be examined and page references to the relevant direct testimony and exhibits. If no notices are filed, and the Commission or presiding officer has no other reason for the witness to appear, the Commission or the presiding officer, in their discretion, may excuse the witness from appearing at the hearing and direct that the witness's testimony be entered by counsel.\n\n(iii) A party intending to use complex numerical hypotheticals, or to question using intricate or extensive cross-references, shall provide adequately documented cross-examination exhibits for the record. Copies of these exhibits should be filed at least two full business days before the scheduled appearance of the witness. They may be filed online or delivered in hardcopy form to counsel for the witness, at the discretion of the party. When presented, examination exhibits are not to be considered record evidence. They are to be transcribed into the record for reference only. If adopted by the witness, the examination exhibit may be offered in evidence by motion.\n\n(iv) At the conclusion of oral cross-examination, the witness shall be given an opportunity to consult with counsel. Counsel shall then be provided an opportunity to examine the witness for the purpose of clarifying statements previously made during oral cross-examination.\n\n(h) Institutional testimony. (1) This paragraph (h) is applicable to testimony offered in evidence that is not sponsored by an individual witness. This typically occurs when discovery questions are answered by the institution, and not by an individual witness.\n\n(2) When institutional responses are offered in evidence by any party, the responding party shall make available at the hearing an officer of the institution that has the authority to attest to the authenticity and truthfulness of the responses, and that has the knowledge to be subject to oral cross-examination in regard to the responses. Section 3010.321 applies as if the officer of the institution were an individual witness.\n\n(i) Limitations on presentation of the evidence. The taking of evidence shall proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch, and to that end, the Commission or the presiding officer may limit appropriately the number of witnesses to be heard upon any issue, the examination by any party to specific issues, and the cross-examination of a witness to that required for a full and true disclosure of the facts necessary for the disposition of the proceeding and to avoid irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony.\n\n(j) Motions during hearing. After a hearing has commenced, a request may be made by motion to the presiding officer for any procedural ruling or relief desired. Such motions shall specify the ruling or relief sought, and state the grounds therefor and statutory or other supporting authority. Motions made during hearings may be stated orally upon the record, except that the presiding officer may require that such motions be reduced to writing and filed separately. Any party shall have the opportunity to answer or object to such motions at the time and in the manner directed by the presiding officer.\n\n(k) Rulings on motions. The presiding officer is authorized to rule upon any such motion not formally acted upon by the Commission prior to the commencement of a prehearing conference or hearing where immediate ruling is essential in order to proceed with the prehearing conference or hearing, and upon any motion to the presiding officer filed or made after the commencement thereof, except that no motion made to the presiding officer, a ruling upon which would involve or constitute a final determination of the proceeding, shall be ruled upon affirmatively by the presiding officer except as a part of a presiding officer's intermediate decision. This section shall not preclude a presiding officer, within the presiding officer's discretion, from referring any motion made in hearing to the Commission for ultimate determination.\n\n(l) Transcript corrections. Corrections to the transcript of a hearing should not be requested except to correct a material substantive error in the transcription made at the hearing. Any request to correct a transcript shall be by motion filed no later than seven days after the transcript, or notice of the availability of a confidential transcript, is posted to the Commission's website. Corrections or changes to actual testimony shall not be allowed.",

          "content": "§ 3010.322   Evidence—general.\n(a) Form and admissibility. In all hearings, relevant and material evidence which is not unduly repetitious or cumulative shall be admissible. Witnesses whose testimony is to be taken shall be sworn, or shall affirm, before their testimony shall be deemed evidence in the proceeding or any questions are put to them.\n\n(b) Documentary material—(1) General. Documents and detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits. Exhibits should be self-explanatory. They should contain appropriate footnotes or narrative explaining the source of each item of information used and the methods employed in statistical compilations. The principal title of each exhibit should state what it contains or represents. The title may also contain a statement of the purpose for which the exhibit is offered; however, this statement will not be considered part of the evidentiary record. Where one part of a multi-part exhibit is based on another part or on another exhibit, appropriate cross-references should be made. Relevant exposition should be included in the exhibits or provided in accompanying testimony. Testimony, exhibits and supporting workpapers prepared for Commission proceedings that are premised on data or conclusions developed in a library reference shall provide the location of that information within the library reference with sufficient specificity to permit ready reference, such as the page and line, or the file and the worksheet or spreadsheet page or cell. Where relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended to be put in evidence, the party offering the same shall plainly designate the matter offered excluding the immaterial or irrelevant parts. If other matter in such document is in such bulk or extent as would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification, and, if properly authenticated, the relevant and material parts may be read into the record, or, if the Commission or presiding officer so directs, a true copy of such matter in proper form shall be received in evidence as an exhibit. Copies of documents shall be delivered by the party offering the same to the other parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the entire document and to offer in evidence in like manner other material and relevant portions thereof.\n\n(2) Status of library references. Designation of material as a library reference and acceptance in the Commission's docket section do not confer evidentiary status. The evidentiary status of the material is governed by § 3010.321(g)(3).\n\n(c) Commission's files. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, any matter contained in a report or other document on file with the Commission may be offered in evidence by specifying the report, document, or other file containing the matter so offered and the report or other document need not be produced or marked for identification.\n\n(d) Public document items. Whenever there is offered in evidence (in whole or in part) a public document, such as an official report, decision, opinion or published scientific or economic statistical data issued by any of the Executive Departments (or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations) and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offeror thereof to be reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced or physically marked for identification, but may be offered in evidence as a public document item by clearly identifying the document and the relevant parts thereof.\n\n(e) Designation of evidence from other Commission dockets. (1) Parties may request that evidence received in other Commission proceedings be entered into the record of the current proceeding. These requests shall be made by motion, shall explain the purpose of the designation, and shall identify material by page and line or paragraph number.\n\n(2) In proceedings to consider the appeal of a Postal Service determination to close or consolidate a post office conducted pursuant to part 3021 of this chapter, these requests must be made at least six days before the date for filing the party's direct case. Oppositions to motions for designations and/or requests for counter-designations shall be filed within three days. Oppositions to requests for counter-designations are due within two days.\n\n(3) In all other proceedings subject to this section, these requests must, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, be made at least 28 days before the date for filing the party's direct case. Oppositions to motions for designations and/or requests for counter-designations shall be filed within 14 days. Oppositions to requests for counter-designations are due within seven days.\n\n(4) In all proceedings subject to this section, the moving party must submit two copies of the identified material to the Secretary at the time requests for designations and counter-designations are made.\n\n(f) Form of prepared testimony and exhibits. Unless the presiding officer otherwise directs, the direct testimony of witnesses shall be reduced to writing and offered either as such or as an exhibit. All prepared testimony and exhibits of a documentary character shall, so far as practicable, conform to the requirements of § 3010.124(a) and (b).\n\n(g) Copies to parties. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, copies of exhibits shall be furnished to the presiding officer and to the parties or counsel during a hearing, unless the presiding officer otherwise directs.\n\n(h) Reception and ruling. The presiding officer shall rule on the admissibility of evidence and otherwise control the reception of evidence so as to confine it to the issues in the proceeding.\n\n(i) Offers of proof. Any offer of proof made in connection with any ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form, or of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.\n\n(j) Official notice of facts. Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United States or of any other matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. Any party shall, on timely request, be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.",

Complete descriptions of any alterations, adjustments, or transformations made to the data as received from the original sources, and the reasons for making the alterations, adjustments, or transformations;\n\n(vii) A complete report of the econometric results including, where applicable coefficient estimates, standard errors and t-values, goodness-of-fit statistics, other appropriate test statistics, the variance/covariance matrix of the estimates, and computed residuals for results computed from samples composed of fewer than 250 observations, and, upon request, other computed residuals; and\n\n(viii) Descriptions of all statistical tests of hypotheses and the results of such tests.\n\n(5) All other studies involving statistical methodology. The following information shall be provided:\n\n(i) The formula used for statistical estimates;\n\n(ii) The standard errors of each component estimated;\n\n(iii) Test statistics and the description of statistical tests and all related computations, and final results; and\n\n(iv) Summary descriptions of input data, and upon request the actual input data shall be made available at the offices of the Commission.\n\n(b) Computer analyses. (1) In the case of computer studies or analyses which are being offered in evidence, or relied upon as support for other evidence, a foundation for the reception of such materials must be laid by furnishing a general description of the program that includes the objectives of the program, the processing tasks performed, the methods and procedures employed, and a listing of the input and output data and source codes (or a showing pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section as to why such codes cannot be so furnished) and such description shall be furnished in all cases. For the purpose of completing such foundation, the following additional items shall be deemed presumptively necessary and shall be furnished upon request of a party, the Commission, or the presiding officer, unless the presumption is overcome by an affirmative showing. The following information shall be provided:\n\n(i) For all input data, designations of all sources of such data, and explanations of any modifications to such data made for use in the program;\n\n(ii) Definitions of all input and output variables or sets of variables;\n\n(iii) A description of input and output data file organization;\n\n(iv) For all source codes, documentation sufficiently comprehensive and detailed to satisfy generally accepted software documentation standards appropriate to the type of program and its intended use in the proceeding;\n\n(v) All pertinent operating system and programming language manuals;\n\n(vi) If the requested program is user interactive, a representative sample run, together with any explanation necessary to illustrate the response sequence;\n\n(vii) An expert on the design and operation of the program shall be provided at a technical conference to respond to any oral or written questions concerning information that is reasonably necessary to enable independent replication of the program output; and\n\n(viii) Computer simulation models offered in evidence or relied upon as support for other evidence, shall be bound by all applicable provisions of this paragraph (b) and the separate requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent that portions of the simulation model utilize or rely upon such studies. Information that compares the simulation model output results to the actual phenomena being modelled, using data other than those from which the model was developed, shall be separately identified and submitted as evidence supporting the test and validation of the simulation model. Separate statements concerning the model limitations, including limiting model design assumptions and range of data input utilized in model design, shall be provided. Where test and validation of the entire simulation model are not possible, test and validation information shall be provided for disaggregate portions of the model. If disaggregate testing and validation are not possible, separate statements to that effect and statements regarding operational experts' review of model validity shall be provided.\n\n(2) Upon timely and otherwise proper request of a party, or sua sponte, the Commission or the presiding officer may rule that matters other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section are necessary to establish the foundation for reception of the evidence concerned and must be furnished.\n\n(3) When the requestor is other than the Commission or the presiding officer, the cost of producing the material required in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this section, shall be borne by the requesting party unless otherwise ordered, for good cause shown by the requestor. When the Commission or the presiding officer is the requestor, it may assume or equitably allocate such costs for good cause shown by the requester.\n\n(4) If the recipient of a request for materials pursuant to this paragraph (b) asserts that compliance with the request would conflict with patent, copyright, trade secret or contract rights applicable to the requested material, the recipient shall immediately notify the requestor and the presiding officer. If valid, the presiding officer shall devise means of accommodating such rights. Such means may include protective orders, including access under protective conditions to the computer facilities of the recipient of a request, making material available for inspection, compensation, or other procedures, according to the nature of the right affected by compliance with this paragraph (b). If the presiding officer determines that compensation is necessary to accommodate the affected right, the cost of compensation shall be borne in the same manner that paragraph (b)(3) of this section prescribes for bearing the costs referenced there. If such right cannot be accommodated by reasonable compensation, or by protective orders or other procedures, and, as a result, materials required by this paragraph (b) cannot be provided, the presiding officer shall determine, in the presiding officer's discretion, whether evidence that relies upon the materials not provided shall be admissible or afforded limited weight.\n\n(c) Other studies and analyses. In the case of all studies and analyses offered in evidence in hearing proceedings or relied upon as support for other evidence, other than the kinds described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, there shall be a clear statement of the study plan, all relevant assumptions and a description of the techniques of data collection, estimation and/or testing. In addition, there shall be a clear statement of the facts and judgments upon which conclusions are based, together with an indication of the alternative courses of action considered and the steps taken to ensure the validity, accuracy, and reliability of the evidence. Tabulations of input data, workbooks, and all other materials necessary to replicate results shall be made available upon request at the offices of the Commission.\n\n(d) Expedition. The party who offers studies or analyses in evidence shall expedite responses to requests made pursuant to this section for data or other information. Responses shall be served on the requesting party, and notice thereof filed with the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of § 3010.127 no later than 3 days after a request is made under § 3010.322(e)(2) or no later than 14 days after a request is made under § 3010.322(e)(3).",

In camera documents and testimony shall constitute a part of the confidential records of the Commission. However, the Commission, on its own motion or pursuant to a request, may make in camera documents and testimony available for inspection, copying, or use by any other governmental agency. The Commission shall, in such circumstances, give reasonable notice of the impending disclosure to the affected party. However, such notice may be waived in extraordinary circumstances for good cause.\n\n(d) Briefing of in camera information. In the submittal of proposed findings, briefs, or other papers, counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony.

It is the sum of: The consumer price index rate authority, and any available density rate authority, retirement obligation rate authority, banked rate authority, and rate authority applicable to non-compensatory classes.\n\n(g) Rate authority applicable to non-compensatory classes means rate authority available to classes where revenue for each product within the class was insufficient to cover that product's attributable costs as determined by the Commission.\n\n(h) Rate cell means each and every separate rate identified as a rate of general applicability.\n\n(i) Rate incentive means a discount that is not a workshare discount and that is designed to increase or retain volume, improve the value of mail for mailers, or improve the operations of the Postal Service.\n\n(j) Rate incentive comparison period is a period of time in the fiscal year or calendar year immediately before a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability is offered. A rate incentive comparison period must be not less than 3 months in length and not more than 12 months in length. Except for a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability that has a term of 1 calendar year, the rate incentive comparison period is the same period of months and days in the fiscal year or calendar year immediately before the rate incentive is offered as the term of the rate incentive.

A rate is not a rate of general applicability if eligibility for the rate is dependent on factors other than the characteristics of the mail to which the rate applies. A rate incentive is not a rate of general applicability if eligibility for the rate is wholly or partially dependent on the volume of mail sent by a mailer in a past year or years or on the participation by a mailer in a rate incentive or promotion in a past year or years. A rate is not a rate of general applicability if it benefits only a single mailer. A rate that is only available upon the written agreement of both the Postal Service and a mailer, a group of mailers, or a foreign postal operator is not a rate of general applicability.\n\n(l) Retirement obligation rate authority means rate authority that is available to all classes to provide revenue for remittance towards the statutorily mandated amortization payments for unfunded liabilities.\n\n(m) A seasonal or temporary rate is a rate that is in effect for a limited and defined period of time.\n\n[85 FR 81126, Dec. 15, 2020, as amended at 90 FR 10690, Feb. 26, 2025]",

          "content": "§ 3030.128   Calculation of percentage change in rates.\n(a) For the purpose of calculating the percentage change in rates, the current rate is the rate in effect at the time of the rate adjustment filing under § 3030.121 with the following exceptions:\n\n(1) A seasonal or temporary rate shall be identified and treated as a rate cell separate and distinct from the corresponding non-seasonal or permanent rate. When used with respect to a seasonal or temporary rate, the current rate is the most recent rate in effect for the rate cell, regardless of whether the seasonal or temporary rate is available at the time of the rate adjustment filing.\n\n(2) When used with respect to a rate cell that corresponds to a rate incentive that was previously excluded from the calculation of the percentage change in rates, the current rate is the full undiscounted rate in effect for the rate cell at the time of the rate adjustment filing, not the discounted rate in effect for the rate cell at such time.\n\n(b) For the purpose of calculating the percentage change in rates, the volume for each rate cell shall be obtained from the most recently available 12 months of Postal Service billing determinants with the following permissible adjustments:\n\n(1) The Postal Service shall make reasonable adjustments to the billing determinants to account for the effects of classification changes such as the introduction, deletion, or redefinition of rate cells. The Postal Service shall identify and explain all adjustments. All information and calculations relied upon to develop the adjustments shall be provided together with an explanation of why the adjustments are appropriate.\n\n(2) Whenever possible, adjustments shall be based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data, as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior.\n\n(3) For an adjustment accounting for the effects of the deletion of a rate cell when an alternate rate cell is not available, the Postal Service should adjust the billing determinants associated with the rate cell to 0. If the Postal Service does not adjust the billing determinants for the rate cell to 0, the Postal Service shall include a rationale for its treatment of the rate cell with the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(c) For a rate adjustment that involves a rate increase, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated in three steps. First, the volume of each rate cell in the class is multiplied by the planned rate for the respective cell and the resulting products are summed. Second, the same set of rate cell volumes is multiplied by the corresponding current rate for each cell and the resulting products are summed. Third, the percentage change in rates is calculated by dividing the results of the first step by the results of the second step and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The result is expressed as a percentage.\n\n(d) For rate adjustments that only involve a rate decrease, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated by amending the workpapers attached to the Commission's order relating to the most recent rate adjustment filing that involved a rate increase to replace the planned rates under the most recent rate adjustment filing that involves a rate increase with the corresponding planned rates applicable to the class from the rate adjustment filing involving only a rate decrease.\n\n(e) The formula for calculating the percentage change in rates for a class, described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\nN = number of rate cells in the class.\n\ni = denotes a rate cell (i = 1, 2, . . ., N).\n\nRi,n = planned rate of rate cell i.\n\nRi,c = current rate of rate cell i (for rate adjustment involving a rate increase) or rate from most recent rate adjustment involving a rate increase for rate cell i (for a rate adjustment only involving a rate decrease).\n\nVi = volume of rate cell i.\n(f)(1) Rate incentives may be excluded from a percentage change in rates calculation. If the Postal Service elects to exclude a rate incentive from a percentage change in rates calculation, the rate incentive shall be treated in the same manner as a rate under a negotiated service agreement (as described in paragraph (g) of this section).\n\n(2) A rate incentive may be included in a percentage change in rates calculation if it meets the following criteria:\n\n(i) The rate incentive is in the form of a discount or can be easily translated into a discount;\n\n(ii) Sufficient billing determinants are available for the rate incentive to be included in the percentage change in rate calculation for the class, which may be adjusted based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data (as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior); and\n\n(iii) The rate incentive is either:\n\n(A) A rate of general applicability; or\n\n(B) A rate not of general applicability that satisfies the following requirements:\n\n(1) The rate incentive is not only available upon the written agreement of both the Postal Service and a mailer, or group of mailers, or a foreign postal operator;\n\n(2) The rate incentive is applicable to all mail meeting standards established by the Mail Classification Schedule, the Domestic Mail Manual, and the International Mail Manual;\n\n(3) The rate incentive does not benefit only a single mailer;\n\n(4) The rate incentive is designed to increase volume; and\n\n(5) A mailer's eligibility for the rate incentive depends on the mailer's sending, in a specified period of time, a volume of mail of specified products that exceeds a specified threshold volume of mail, provided that such threshold volume of mail is not less than the volume of the specified products that the mailer sent in the rate incentive comparison period.\n\n(3) The Commission may require submission of such information as it deems necessary to ensure that rate incentives included in the percentage change in rates calculation comply with the requirements of this section.\n\n(g)(1) Mail volumes sent at rates under a negotiated service agreement or a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability are to be included in the calculation of the percentage change in rates under this section as though they paid the appropriate rates of general applicability, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Where it is impractical to identify the rates of general applicability (e.g., because unique rate categories are created for a mailer), the volumes associated with the mail sent under the terms of the negotiated service agreement or the rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability shall be excluded from the calculation of the percentage change in rates.\n\n(2) The Postal Service shall identify and explain all assumptions it makes with respect to the treatment of negotiated service agreements and rate incentives that are not rates of general applicability in the calculation of the percentage change in rates and provide the rationale for its assumptions.\n\n[85 FR 81126, Dec. 15, 2020, as amended at 90 FR 10690, Feb. 26, 2025]",

As described in § 3030.184, for retirement obligation rate authority to be made available, the Postal Service must annually remit towards these amortization payments all revenue collected under this subpart previously. The full retirement obligation rate authority, calculated as described in § 3030.183, shall be phased in over 5 fiscal years, taking into account changes in volume during the phase-in period. If combined with an equal rate increase on Competitive products, the compounded rate increase resulting from retirement obligation rate authority is calculated to generate sufficient additional revenue at the end of the phase-in period to permit the Postal Service to remit the entire invoiced amount of its amortization payments.\n\n(b) Until the conclusion of the phase-in period, the Postal Service shall file a notice with the Commission by December 31 of each year that calculates the amount of retirement obligation rate authority that is eligible to be authorized under this subpart.\n\n(c) The Commission shall review the Postal Service's notice and determine how much, if any, rate authority will be authorized under this subpart. Any rate authority allocated under this subpart:\n\n(1) Shall be made available to the Postal Service as of the date of the Commission's determination;\n\n(2) Must be included in the calculation of the maximum rate adjustment authority in the first generally applicable rate adjustment filed after the Commission's determination;\n\n(3) Shall lapse if not used in the first generally applicable rate adjustment filed after the Commission's determination;\n\n(4) Shall lapse if unused, within 12 months of the Commission's determination, however this paragraph (c)(4) shall not prohibit the Postal Service from making a stand-alone adjustment to one or two generally applicable rate cells, if such a case were to be followed by a broader rate adjustment in the class later in the same fiscal year; and\n\n(5) May not be used to generate unused rate authority, nor shall it affect existing banked rate authority.",

(1) The formula for calculating the amount of retirement obligation rate authority available under this subpart, described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\nT = most recently completed fiscal year.\n\nAPT = total amortization payment for fiscal year T.\n\nTRT = total revenue in fiscal year T.\n\nPARAT = previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority, compounded through fiscal year T, expressed as a proportion of the market dominant rate base and calculated using the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n\nN = number of previously issued determinations in which retirement obligation rate authority was made available under this subpart.\n(2) The formula for calculating the amount of previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority through fiscal year T, described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\nT = most recently completed fiscal year.\n\nrt = retirement obligation rate authority authorized in fiscal year T.\n\nN = number of previously issued determinations in which retirement obligation rate authority was made available under this subpart.\n(b) Calculations. (1) The amount of retirement obligation rate authority available for a fiscal year shall be calculated in four steps. First, the ratio of the total amortization payment for the fiscal year under review to the total revenue in the fiscal year under review shall be added to 1. This sum represents the factor by which an equal increase in market dominant and competitive rates in the fiscal year under review would generate sufficient additional revenue to make the full amortization payment. It does not account, however, for any previous rate authority authorized under this subpart. The second step is therefore to subtract the proportion of the market dominant rate base resulting from previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority. That proportion is calculated using the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Third, to amortize the resulting amount of retirement obligation rate authority over the remainder of the phase-in period, the difference shall be raised to the power of the inverse of the number of determinations remaining in the phase-in period, including the current determination. Finally, 1 shall be subtracted from the result to convert from a proportional change in rates to a percentage of rate adjustment authority.\n\n(2) The amount of previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority shall be calculated in two steps. First, the sums of 1 and the amount of retirement obligation rate authority authorized in each of the previous fiscal years shall be multiplied together. This product represents the compounded amount of such rate authority, expressed as a net rate increase. To express this product as a proportion of the market dominant rate base, the second step is to subtract the inverse of this product from 1.",

During each fiscal year subsequent to January 14, 2021, the Postal Service shall remit towards the liabilities identified in § 3030.182 an amount equal to or greater than the amount of revenue collected as a result of all previous rate increases under this subpart during the previous fiscal year, as calculated using the formulas in paragraph (b) of this section, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(b) Formulas. (1) The formula for calculating the amount of revenue collected under this subpart during a fiscal year, described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\nT = most recently completed fiscal year.\n\nMDRT = market dominant revenue in fiscal year T.\n\nN = number of previously issued determinations in which retirement obligation rate authority was made available under this subpart.\n\nrt = retirement obligation rate authority authorized in fiscal year t.\n\npt = prorated fraction of rt that was in effect during fiscal year T, calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n(2) The formula for calculating the prorated fraction of retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular fiscal year t that was in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year, described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\nT = most recently completed fiscal year.\n\nrt = retirement obligation rate authority authorized under this subpart in fiscal year t.\n\nQ = the number of the quarter during the fiscal year of the effective date of the price increase including retirement obligation rate authority made available under this subpart.\n\nEQ = number of days in quarter Q subsequent to and including the effective date of the price increase.\n\nDQ = total number of days in quarter Q.\n\nQMDVQ = market dominant volume in quarter Q.\n\nMDVT = market dominant volume in fiscal year T.\n(c) Calculations. (1) The amount of revenue collected under this subpart during a fiscal year, as calculated by the formula in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be calculated in three steps. First, the sums of 1 and the amount of retirement obligation rate authority made available under this subpart during each previous fiscal year—prorated to account for mid-year price increases as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section—shall be multiplied together. This product represents the proportion by which prices were higher during the most recently completed fiscal year as a result of retirement obligation rate authority. Second, to express this net price increase as a proportion of market dominant revenue, the inverse of this product shall be subtracted from 1. Finally, the result shall be multiplied by market dominant revenue for the fiscal year to change the proportion into a dollar amount.\n\n(2)(i) The prorated fraction of retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular fiscal year that was in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year, as calculated by the formula in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be a piecewise function of three parts. First, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular year was not in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be 0. Second, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular year was in effect during the entirety of the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be 1. Finally, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular fiscal year was used to raise prices during the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be the proportion of volume sent during the fiscal year after that rate increase went into effect.\n\n(ii) The proportion in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be calculated in four steps. First, the number of days of the fiscal quarter after and including the effective date of the price adjustment including the retirement obligation rate authority shall be divided by the total number of days in that fiscal quarter. This quotient determines the proportion of days in that quarter in which the higher rates were in effect. Second, that quotient shall be multiplied by the market dominant volume from that fiscal quarter to determine the amount of volume during the quarter receiving the higher rates. Third, that product shall be added to the market dominant volume from any subsequent quarters of the fiscal year because the volume in those quarters was also sent under the higher rates. Finally, this sum shall be divided by the total market dominant volume from the fiscal year to determine the proportion of annual volume sent after the rate increase went into effect.",

The Postal Service must file any application for waiver at least 60 days prior to filing the proposal to adjust a rate associated with the applicable workshare discount. In its application for waiver, the Postal Service shall indicate the approximate filing date for its next rate adjustment filing.\n\n(b) The application for waiver shall be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and demonstrate that a waiver from the limitations imposed by §§ 3030.283 through 3030.284 should be granted. Preponderance of the evidence means proof by information that, compared with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not.\n\n(c) The application for waiver shall include a specific and detailed statement signed by one or more knowledgeable Postal Service official(s) who sponsors the application and attests to the accuracy of the information contained within the statement. The statement shall set forth the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section, as applicable to the specific workshare discount for which a waiver is sought:\n\n(1) The reason(s) why a waiver is alleged to be necessary (with justification thereof), including all relevant supporting analysis and all assumptions relied upon.\n\n(2) The length of time for which a waiver is alleged to be necessary (with justification thereof).\n\n(3) For each subsequent rate adjustment filing planned to occur during the length of time for which a waiver is sought, a representation of the proposed minimum amount of the change to the workshare discount.\n\n(4) For a claim that the amount of the workshare discount exceeding the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service is necessary in order to mitigate rate shock (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(2)(B)), the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section:\n\n(i) A description of the customers that the Postal Service claims would be adversely affected.\n\n(ii) Prices and volumes for the workshare discount at issue (the benchmark and workshared mail category) for the last 10 years.\n\n(iii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the nature and extent of the likely harm to the customers that would result from setting the workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c).\n\n(5) For a claim that setting an excessive or low workshare discount closer or equal to the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service, the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section:\n\n(i) A description of the operational strategy at issue.\n\n(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating how the workshare discount at issue is related to that operational strategy.\n\n(iii) How setting the workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) or § 3030.284(c), whichever is applicable, would impede that operational strategy.\n\n(6) For a claim that reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount would lead to a loss of volume in the affected category of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the Postal Service's institutional costs from the mail that is subject to the discount (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(A)), the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section:\n\n(i) A description of the affected category of mail.\n\n(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the expected loss of volume and reduced contribution that is claimed would result from reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount.\n\n(iii) How setting the excessive workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) would lead to the expected loss of volume and reduced contribution.\n\n(7) For a claim that reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(B)), or a claim that increasing or eliminating a low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount, the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section:\n\n(i) A description of the mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.\n\n(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the expected size of the rate increase that is claimed would result in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.\n\n(iii) How setting the excessive workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) or the low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product in compliance with § 3030.284(c) or (e), whichever is applicable, would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.\n\n(8) Any other relevant factors or reasons to support the application for waiver.\n\n(d) Unless the Commission otherwise provides, commenters will be given at least 7 calendar days to respond to the application for waiver after it has been filed by the Postal Service.\n\n(e) To better evaluate the waiver application, the Commission may, on its own behalf or by request of any interested person, order the Postal Service to provide experts on the subject matter of the waiver application to participate in technical conferences, prepare statements clarifying or supplementing their views, or answer questions posed by the Commission or its representatives.\n\n(f) For a proposed workshare discount that would exceed the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service, the application for waiver shall be granted only if at least one provision appearing in 39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(2)(A) through (e)(2)(D) or 39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(A) through (e)(3)(B) is determined to apply.\n\n(g) For a proposed workshare discount that would be set below the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service, the application for waiver shall be granted only if setting the workshare discount closer or equal to the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service or if increasing or eliminating a low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount.\n\n(h) The Commission will issue an order announcing, at a minimum, whether the requested waiver will be granted or denied no later than 21 days following the close of any comment period(s). An order granting the application for waiver shall specify all conditions upon which the waiver is granted, including the date upon which the waiver shall expire.",
