However, where a claim is subject, for a peroid of four years after September 28, 1976, to this section solely by virtue of § 9.10(a)(3), the date before which there must have been significant disturbance for purposes of mineral extraction is January 26, 1977. \n\n(b) An operator of a claim in one of these units seeking to enlarge an existing excavation or otherwise disturb the surface for purposes of mineral exploration or development shall file with the Superintendent an application stating his need to disturb additional surface in order to maintain production at an annual rate not to exceed an average annual production level of said operations for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975. Accompanying the application shall be a plan of operations which complies with § 9.9 and verified copies of production records for the years 1973, 1974, and 1975. \n\n(c) If the Regional Director finds that the submitted plan of operations complies with § 9.9, that enlargement of the existing excavation of an individual mining operation is necessary in order to make feasible continued production therefrom at an annual rate not to exceed the average annual production level of said operation for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975, and that the plan of operations meets the applicable standard of approval of § 9.10(a)(1), he shall issue a permit allowing the disturbance of the surface of the lands contiguous to the existing excavation to the minimum extent necessary to effect such enlargement. For the purpose of this section “lands contiguous to the existing excavation” shall include land which actually adjoins the existing excavation or which could logically become an extension of the excavation; for example, drilling to determine the extent and direction to which the existing excavation should be extended may be permitted at a site which does not actually adjoin the excavating. \n\n(d) The appropriate reclamation standard to be applied will be determined by the nature of the claim. (See §§ 9.11(a)(1) and (a)(2).) \n\n(e) Operations conducted under a permit pursuant to this section shall be subject to all the limitations imposed by this part. \n\n(f) For the purposes of this section, each separate mining excavation shall be treated as an individual mining operation.",

No such appeal will be considered unless it is filed with the Regional Director within thirty (30) days after the date of notification to the operator of the action or decision complained of. Upon receipt of such written statement from the aggrieved operator, the Regional Director shall promptly review the action or decision and either reverse his original decision or prepare his own statement, explaining that decision and the reasons therefor, and forward the statement and record on appeal to the Director, National Park Service, for review and decision. Copies of the Regional Director's statement shall be furnished to the aggrieved operator, who shall have 20 days within which to file exceptions to the Regional Director's decision. The Department has the discretion to initiate a hearing before the Office of Hearing and Appeals in a particular case. (See 43 CFR 4.700.)\n\n(b) The official files of the National Park Service on the proposed plan of operations and any testimony and documents submitted by the parties on which the decision of the Regional Director was based shall constitute the record on appeal. The Regional Director shall maintain the record under separate cover and shall certify that it is the record on which his decision was based at the time it is forwarded to the Director of the National Park Service. The National Park Service shall make the record available to the operator upon request.\n\n(c) If the Director considers the record inadequate to support the decision on appeal, he may provide for the production of such additional evidence or information as may be appropriate, or may remand the case to the Regional Director, with appropriate instructions for further action.\n\n(d) On or before the expiration of forty-five (45) days after his receipt of the exceptions to the Regional Director's decision, the Director shall make his decision in writing; Provided, however, That if more than forty-five (45) days are required for a decision after the exceptions are received, the Director shall notify the parties to the appeal and specify the reason(s) for delay. The decision of the Director shall include (1) a statement of facts, (2) conclusions, and (3) reasons upon which the conclusions are based. The decision of the Director shall be the final administrative action of the agency on a proposed plan of operations.\n\n(e) A decision of the Regional Director from which an appeal is taken shall not be automatically stayed by the filing of a statement of appeal. A request for a stay may accompany the statement of appeal or may be directed to the Director. The Director shall promptly rule on requests for stays. A decision of the Director on request for a stay shall constitute a final administrative decision.",

In determining whether to close an area or restrict an activity, or whether to terminate or relax a closure or restriction, the Superintendent must ensure that the activity or area is managed in a manner compatible with the purposes for which the park area was established.

This paragraph applies only to a closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, which is of a nature, magnitude and duration that will result in a significant alteration in the public use pattern of the area; adversely affect the area's natural, aesthetic, scenic, or cultural values; or require a long-term modification in the resource management objectives of the area. Except in emergency situations, the closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, must be published as a rulemaking in the Federal Register.\n\n(d) Written determination. Except in emergency situations, prior to implementing or terminating a closure or restriction, the superintendent shall prepare a written determination justifying the action. That determination shall set forth the reasons the closure or restriction authorized by paragraph (a) of this section has been established.

In other circumstances, controlling interest means any arrangement under which a third party has the ability to exercise management authority over the actions or operations of the business.\n\nDirector means the Director of the National Park Service or an authorized representative.\n\nHistorical operator, except as otherwise may be specified by a statute other than ANILCA, means the holder of a valid written authorization from the Director to provide visitor services within a park area that:\n\n(1) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully engaged in adequately providing such visitor services in the applicable park area;\n\n(2) Has continued, as further defined in § 13.310, to lawfully provide that visitor service since January 1, 1979, without a change in controlling interest; and\n\n(3) Is otherwise determined by the Director to have a right to continue to provide such services or similar services pursuant to § 13.310.\n\nLocal area means an area in Alaska within 100 miles of the location within the park area where any of the applicable visitor services is authorized to be provided.\n\nLocal resident means:\n\nFor individuals. Those individuals who have lived within the local area for 12 consecutive months before issuance of a solicitation of offers for a visitor services authorization for a park area and who maintain their primary, permanent residence and business within the local area and whenever absent from this primary, permanent residence, have the intention of returning to it. Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent residence and business may include, but are not limited to, the permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax returns and voter registration.\n\nFor corporations. A corporation in which the controlling interest is held by an individual or individuals who qualify as local resident(s) within the meaning of this subpart. For non-profit corporations a majority of the board members and a majority of the officers must qualify individually as local residents.\n\nNative Corporation means the same as defined in section 102(6) of ANILCA.\n\nPreferred operator means a Native Corporation that is determined under § 13.325 to be “most directly affected” by the establishment or expansion of a park area by ANILCA, or a local resident as defined in this subpart.\n\nResponsive offer is one that is timely received and meets the terms and conditions of a solicitation for a visitor services authorization.\n\nVisitor services authorization is a written authorization from the Director to provide visitor services in a park area. Such authorization may be in the form of a concession permit, concession contract, or other document issued by the Director under National Park Service policies and procedures.",

A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization. The authorization will be for a fixed term. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization will result in cancellation of the authorization and consequent loss of historical operator rights under this subpart.\n\n(b) Nothing in this subpart will prohibit the Director from permitting persons in addition to historical operators to provide visitor services in park areas at the Director's discretion as long as historical operators are permitted to conduct a scope and level of visitor services equal to those provided before January 1, 1979, under terms and conditions consistent with this subpart. A historical operator may be permitted by the Director under separate authority to increase the scope or level of visitor services provided prior to January 1, 1979, but no historical operating rights will be obtained in such increase.\n\n(c) If a historical operator applies for a visitor services authorization in the form of a joint venture, the application will not be considered as validly made unless the historical operator demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Director, that it has the controlling interest in the joint venture.\n\n(d) A historical operator may apply to the Director for an authorization or amended authorization to provide visitor services similar to those it provided before January 1, 1979. The Director will grant the request if such visitor services are determined by the Director to be:\n\n(1) Consistent with the protection of park resources and the purposes for which the park area was established;\n\n(2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and\n\n(3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.\n\n(e) When a historical operator's visitor services authorization expires, and if the applicable visitor services continue to be consistent with the purposes for which the park area was established as determined by the Director, the Director will offer to renew the authorization for a fixed term under such new terms and conditions as the Director determines are in the public interest.\n\n(f) If the Director determines that authorized visitor services must be curtailed or reduced in scope, level, or season to protect park resources, or for other purposes, the Director will require the historical operator to make such changes in visitor services. If more than one historical operator providing the same type of visitor services is required to have those services curtailed, the Director will establish a proportionate reduction of visitor services among all such historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and other appropriate factors so as to achieve a fair curtailment of visitor services among the historical operators. If the level of visitor services must be so curtailed that only one historical operator feasibly may continue to provide the visitor services, the Director will select one historical operator to continue to provide the curtailed visitor services through a competitive selection process.\n\n(g) Any of the following will result in loss of historical operator status:\n\n(1) Revocation of an authorization for historic types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n(2) A historical operator's declination of a renewal of the authorization made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(3) A change in the controlling interest of the historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or by any other means, direct or indirect. A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals who were personally engaged in the visitor services activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, will not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.\n\n(4) A historical operator's failure to provide the authorized services for more than 24 consecutive months.\n\n(h) The Director may authorize other persons to provide visitor services in a park area in addition to historical operators.",

All offerors, including preferred operators, must submit a responsive offer to the solicitation in order to be considered for the authorization.

If the amended offer of such a preferred operator is considered by the Director as at least substantially equal to the best offer, the preferred operator will receive the visitor service authorization.

Recreational use of snowmachines was not a traditional activity.

          "content": "§ 13.952   May a snowmachine be used in that portion of the park formerly known as Mt. McKinley National Park (Old Park)?\nNo, based on the application of the definition of traditional activities within the park to the factual history of the Old Park, there are no traditional activities that occurred during periods of adequate snow cover within the Old Park; and, thus, Section 1110(a) of ANILCA does not authorize snowmachine access. Hunting and trapping were not and are not legally permitted activities in the Old Park at any time of the year. Sport fishing has not taken place in the Old Park during periods of adequate snow cover due to weather conditions that are adverse to sport fishing, and the limited fishery resources within the Old Park. During periods of adequate snow cover, berry picking is not feasible, and has not taken place in the Old Park. Under the definition, recreational use of snowmachines is not a traditional activity. There are no villages, homesites or other valid occupancies within the Old Park. Access by snowmachine through the Old Park in transit to homesites, villages and other valid occupancies was not lawful prior to the enactment of ANILCA and is available through routes outside the Old Park that have been historically used for that purpose. Therefore, the use of snowmachines is not authorized by section 1110(a) for such travel. Further, Congress did not authorize subsistence activities in the Old Park. In addition, the National Park Service has determined that the use of even a few snowmachines in the Old Park would be detrimental to the resource values of the area. Therefore, because no usage is authorized in the Old Park by section 1110(a) the Old Park remains closed to all snowmachine use in accordance with 36 CFR 2.18.",

The standards also apply to use and development of public property. From time to time these standards may be reviewed and revised. These standards are intended:\n\n(1) To promote the protection and development of the land within the Seashore, for the purposes of the Fire Island National Seashore Act (the Act), by means of size, location, or use limitations or restrictions on commercial, residential, or other structures with the objective of controlling population density and protecting the island's natural resources;\n\n(2) To limit development and use of land to single-family homes, to prohibit development and use of multiple family homes, and to prohibit the conversion of structures to multiple family homes;\n\n(3) To prohibit commercial or industrial uses initiated after September 11, 1964 or the expansion of existing commercial or industrial uses on any property within the Seashore which is inconsistent with the Federal standards and approved local ordinances or the purposes of the Act, is likely to cause a significant harm to the resources of the Seashore or will not provide a service to Fire Island;\n\n(4) To recognize that the zoning authorities have the primary responsibility for zoning enforcement within the Seashore;\n\n(5) To provide that private property within the Community Development District may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances and the Federal standards;\n\n(6) To provide that, within the Seashore District, private “improved property” may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances, and the Federal standards;\n\n(7) To provide that, in the Dune District, private undeveloped property, if otherwise subject to condemnation, may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in its natural state; and\n\n(8) To provide a mechanism for the Superintendent to inform landowners and the zoning authority if a use or development will be inconsistent with the Federal standards or the purposes of the Act and may subject the property to condemnation, subject to available funds.\n\n(b) The Secretary may utilize any other statutory authority available to the Secretary for the conservation and development of natural resources to the extent the Secretary finds that such authority will further the purpose of the Act.",

The purpose of concession contracts is to authorize persons (concessioners) to provide visitor services in park areas. All concession contracts are to be consistent with the requirements of this part. In accordance with section 403 of the 1998 Act, the Director will utilize concession contracts to authorize the provision of visitor services in park areas, except as may otherwise be authorized by law. For example, the Director may enter into commercial use authorizations under section 418 of the 1998 Act and may enter into agreements with non-profit organizations for the sale of interpretive materials and conduct of interpretive programs for a fee or charge in park areas. In addition, the Director may, as part of an interpretive program agreement otherwise authorized by law, authorize a non-profit organization to provide incidental visitor services that are necessary for the conduct of the interpretive program.

          "content": "§ 51.3   How are terms defined in this part?\nTo understand this part, you must refer to these definitions, applicable in the singular or the plural, whenever these terms are used in this part: \n\nThe 1965 Act means Public Law 89-249, commonly known as the National Park Service Concession Policies Act of 1965. \n\nA 1965 Act concession contract is a concession contract or permit entered into under the authority of the 1965 Act. \n\nThe 1998 Act means Title IV of Public Law 105-391. \n\nThe award of a concession contract is the establishment of a legally binding concession contract. It occurs only when the Director and a selected offeror both fully execute a concession contract. \n\nA concession contract (or contract) means a binding written agreement between the Director and a concessioner entered under the authority of this part or the 1965 Act that authorizes the concessioner to provide certain visitor services within a park area under specified terms and conditions. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (the Contract Disputes Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions. Concession contracts will contain such terms and conditions as are required by this part or law and as are otherwise appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this part and the 1998 Act. \n\nA concessioner is an individual, corporation, or other legally recognized entity that duly holds a concession contract. \n\nDirector means the Director of the National Park Service (acting on behalf of the Secretary), or an authorized representative of the Director, except where a particular official is specifically identified in this part. In circumstances where this part calls for an appeal to the Director, the appeal shall be considered by an official of higher authority than the official that made the disputed decision. \n\nA franchise fee is the consideration paid to the Director by a concessioner for the privileges granted by a concession contract. \n\nOfferor means an individual, corporation, or other legally recognized entity, including an existing concessioner, that submits a proposal for a concession contract. If the entity that is to be the concessioner is not formally in existence as of the time of submission of a proposal, a proposal must demonstrate that the individuals or organizations that intend to establish the entity that will become the concessioner have the ability and are legally obliged to cause the entity to be a qualified person as defined in this part. In addition, if the entity that will be the concessioner is not established at the time of submission of a proposal, the proposal must contain assurances satisfactory to the Director that the entity that will be the concessioner will be a qualified person as of the date of the award of the contract and otherwise have the ability to carry out the commitments made in the proposal. \n\nPossessory interest means an interest in real property improvements as defined by the 1965 Act obtained by a concessioner under a possessory interest concession contract. Possessory interest, for the purposes of this part, does not include any interest in property in which no possessory interest, as defined by the 1965 Act, exists. \n\nA possessory interest concession contract means a 1965 Act concession contract that provides the concessioner a possessory interest. \n\nA preferred offeror is a concessioner that the Director determines is eligible to exercise a right of preference to the award of a qualified concession contract in accordance with this part. \n\nA qualified concession contract is a new concession contract that the Director determines to be a qualified concession contract for right of preference purposes. \n\nA qualified person is an individual, corporation or other legally recognized entity that the Director determines has the experience and financial ability to satisfactorily carry out the terms of a concession contract. This experience and financial ability includes, but is not limited to, the ability to protect and preserve the resources of the park area and the ability to provide satisfactory visitor services at reasonable rates to the public. \n\nA responsive proposal means a timely submitted proposal that is determined by the Director as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the proposed concession contract and prospectus and as having provided the information required by the prospectus. \n\nA right of preference is the preferential right of renewal set forth in Section 403(7)(C) of the 1998 Act which requires the Director to allow a preferred offeror the opportunity to match the terms and conditions of a competing responsive proposal that the Director has determined to be the best proposal for a qualified concession contract. A right of preference does not provide any rights of any nature to establish or negotiate the terms and conditions of a concession contract to which a right of preference may apply. \n\nVisitor services means accommodations, facilities and services determined by the Director as necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of a park area provided to park area visitors for a fee or charge by a person other than the Director. The fee or charge paid by the visitor may be direct or indirect as part of the provision of comprehensive visitor services (e.g., when a lodging concessioner may provide free transportation services to guests). Visitor services may include, but are not limited to, lodging, campgrounds, food service, merchandising, tours, recreational activities, guiding, transportation, and equipment rental. Visitor services also include the sale of interpretive materials or the conduct of interpretive programs for a fee or charge to visitors.",

The public solicitation process begins with the issuance of a prospectus. The prospectus will invite the general public to submit proposals for the contract. The prospectus will describe the terms and conditions of the concession contract to be awarded and the procedures to be followed in the selection of the best proposal. \n\n(b) Except as provided under § 51.47 (which calls for a final administrative decision on preferred offeror appeals prior to the selection of the best proposal) the terms, conditions and determinations of the prospectus and the terms and conditions of the proposed concession contract as described in the prospectus, including, without limitation, its minimum franchise fee, are not final until the concession contract is awarded. The Director will not issue a new prospectus for a concession contract earlier than eighteen months prior to the expiration of a related existing contract except when the Director determines it is necessary to provide additional time to potential offerors, such as when additional time is needed to avoid issuing a prospectus during a busy operating season or where potential offerors must make significant financial commitments to meet the requirements of the contract. This additional time should be as short as prudent.\n\n(c) The Director will issue a prospectus for a new concession opportunity in a park area when the Director determines, in the Director's discretion, that a new concession opportunity is necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the park area and is consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the park area.\n\n(d) The Director will establish procedures to solicit and consider suggestions for new concession opportunities within park areas from the public (including from potential concessioners) through the National Park Service's planning processes for such opportunities as well as through annual invitations for proposals for improving visitor experiences through third-party providers. The Director shall fully review all proposals received, provide a written evaluation for each proposal, and make all proposals and completed evaluations available to the public.\n\n(e) In determining whether to issue a prospectus for a concession contract to provide such new concession opportunities, the Director will consider relevant factors including whether the suggested concession opportunities are adequately provided within the park area by other authorized commercial providers; the potential for augmented resources for park area operations; the effects of the suggested concession operations on the park area; the long-term viability of the suggested concession opportunities; the innovative quality of the suggestions; and the potential impacts on park area visitation and on communities located near the park area.\n\n(f) No preference to a concession contract shall be granted to a party based on that party's having submitted a proposal for a new concession opportunity described in this section. The Director, however, may award a contract noncompetitively to such a party when determined appropriate as described in § 51.25.\n\n(g) The Director may consider suggestions for new services as additional services to be provided through an existing concession contract as described in § 51.76.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall constrain the discretion of the Director to solicit or consider suggestions for new concession opportunities or collect other information that can be used by the Director in connection with a new concession opportunity.\n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90117, Dec. 29, 2023]",

An offeror may not amend or supplement a proposal after the submission date unless requested by the Director to do so and the Director provides all offerors that submitted proposals a similar opportunity to amend or supplement their proposals.

For each selection factor, the Director will assign a score that reflects the determined merits of the proposal under the applicable selection factor and in comparison to the other proposals received, if any. The maximum aggregate score available for all selection factors will be 40 points, and every selection factor used must have a maximum score of one point or higher. Each selection factor will be scored as identified in the prospectus, subject to the following criteria:\n\n(1) The maximum score assignable for the principal selection factor described in § 51.17(a)(5) will be less than the lowest maximum score of the other principal selection factors described in § 51.17(a) with a score of one point for agreeing to the prospectus franchise fee (as defined in § 51.78) or, when the Director determines appropriate, the minimum acceptable franchise fee set forth in the prospectus.\n\n(2) The maximum score assignable for the secondary selection factor set forth in § 51.17(b)(1) will be less than the maximum score for the principal selection factor described in § 51.17(a)(5); and,\n\n(3) The maximum scores assignable for any additional secondary selection factors set forth in § 51.17(b) will be such that the maximum aggregate score assignable for all additional secondary selection factors will be less than the maximum score for the principal selection factor described in § 51.17(a)(5).\n\n(b) The Director will then assign a cumulative point score to each proposal based on the assigned score for each selection factor. \n\n(c) The responsive proposal with the highest cumulative point score will be selected by the Director as the best proposal. If two or more responsive proposals receive the same highest point score, the Director will select as the best proposal (from among the responsive proposals with the same highest point score), the responsive proposal that the Director determines on the basis of a narrative explanation will, on an overall basis, best achieve the purposes of this part. Consideration of revenue to the United States in this determination and in scoring proposals under principal selection factor five will be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving the resources of the park area and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services to the public at reasonable rates. \n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90118, Dec. 29, 2023]",

However, consideration of revenue to the United States will be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services to the public at reasonable rates. \n\n(b) The secondary selection factors are: \n\n(1) The quality of the offeror's proposal to conduct its operations in a manner that furthers the protection, conservation and preservation of park area and other resources through environmental management programs and activities, including, without limitation, energy conservation, waste reduction, and recycling. A prospectus may exclude this secondary factor if the prospectus solicits proposals for a concession contract that is anticipated to have annual gross receipts of less than $100,000 and the activities that will be conducted under the contract are determined by the Director as likely to have only limited impacts on the resources of the park area; and \n\n(2) Any other selection factors the Director may adopt in furtherance of the purposes of this part, including, where appropriate and otherwise permitted by law, the extent to which a proposal calls for the employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and/or involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian Tribes, Native Alaskans, or minority or women-owned businesses in operations under the proposed concession contract. When appropriate, the Director will include a secondary selection factor requesting suggestions for new services.\n\n(c) A prospectus may include subfactors under each of the principal and secondary factors to describe specific elements of the selection factor. \n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90118, Dec. 29, 2023]",

The deciding official must prepare a written decision on the appeal, taking into account the content of the appeal, other written information available, and the requirements of this part. The written decision on the appeal must be issued by the date of selection of the best proposal submitted in response to a prospectus.

If the appeal results in a determination that a concessioner is not a preferred offeror, no right of preference will apply to the award of the related concession contract and the award will be made in accordance with the requirements of this part. \n\n(d) No person will be considered as having exhausted administrative remedies with respect to a determination by the Director that a concessioner is or is not a preferred offeror until the Director issues a written decision in response to an appeal submitted pursuant to this section, or, where applicable, pursuant to an appeal provided by the administrative guidelines described in paragraph (b) of this section.

All arbitration proceedings conducted under the authority of this subpart or subpart H of this part will utilize the following procedures unless otherwise agreed by the concessioner and the Director. One member of the arbitration panel will be selected by the concessioner, one member will be selected by the Director, and the third (neutral) member will be selected by the two party-appointed members. The neutral arbiter must be a licensed real estate appraiser. The expenses of the neutral arbiter and other associated common costs of the arbitration will be borne equally by the concessioner and the Director. The arbitration panel will adopt procedures that treat each party equally, give each party the opportunity to be heard, and give each party a fair opportunity to present its case. Adjudicative procedures are not encouraged but may be adopted by the panel if determined necessary in the circumstances of the dispute. Determinations must be made by a majority of the members of the panel and will be binding on the concessioner and the Director. \n\nA capital improvement is a structure, fixture, or non-removable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract and located on lands of the United States within a park area. A capital improvement does not include any interest in land. Additionally, a capital improvement does not include any interest in personal property of any kind including, but not limited to, vehicles, boats, barges, trailers, or other objects, regardless of size, unless an item of personal property becomes a fixture as defined in this part. Concession contracts may further describe, consistent with the limitations of this part and the 1998 Act, the nature and type of specific capital improvements in which a concessioner may obtain a leasehold surrender interest. \n\nConstruction cost of a capital improvement means the total of the incurred eligible direct and indirect costs necessary for constructing or installing the capital improvement that are capitalized by the concessioner in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP). The term “construct” or “construction” as used in this part also means “install” or “installation” of fixtures where applicable. \n\nConsumer Price Index means the national “Consumer Price Index—All Urban Consumers” published by the Department of Labor. If this index ceases to be published, the Director will designate another regularly published cost-of-living index approximating the national Consumer Price Index. \n\nDepreciation means the loss of value in a capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability of the capital improvement in comparison with a new unit of like kind. \n\nEligible direct costs means the sum of all incurred capitalized costs (in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project), that are necessary both for the construction of a capital improvement and are typically elements of a construction contract. Eligible direct costs may include, without limitation, the costs of (if capitalized in accordance with GAAP and in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project): building permits; materials, products and equipment used in construction; labor used in construction; security during construction; contractor's shack and temporary fencing; material storage facilities; power line installation and utility costs during construction; performance bonds; and contractor's (and subcontractor's) profit and overhead (including job supervision, worker's compensation insurance and fire, liability, and unemployment insurance). \n\nEligible indirect costs means, except as provided in the last sentence of this definition, the sum of all other incurred capitalized costs (in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project) necessary for the construction of a capital improvement. Eligible indirect costs may include, without limitation, the costs of (if capitalized in accordance with GAAP and in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project): architectural and engineering fees for plans, plan checks; surveys to establish building lines and grades; environmental studies; if the project is financed, the points, fees or service charges and interest on construction loans; all risk insurance expenses and ad valorem taxes during construction. The actual capitalized administrative expenses (in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project) of the concessioner for direct, on-site construction inspection are eligible indirect costs. Other administrative expenses of the concessioner are not eligible indirect costs. \n\nFixtures and non-removable equipment are manufactured items of personal property of independent form and utility necessary for the basic functioning of a structure that are affixed to and considered to be part of the structure such that title is with the Director as real property once installed. Fixtures and non-removable equipment do not include building materials (e.g., wallboard, flooring, concrete, cinder blocks, steel beams, studs, window frames, windows, rafters, roofing, framing, siding, lumber, insulation, wallpaper, paint, etc.). Because of their special circumstances, floating docks (but not other types of floating property) constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a leasehold surrender interest concession contract are considered to be non-removable equipment for leasehold surrender interest purposes only. Except as otherwise indicated in this part, the term “fixture” as used in this part includes the term “non-removable equipment.” \n\nLeasehold surrender interest means a right to payment in accordance with this part for related capital improvements that a concessioner makes or provides within a park area on lands owned by the United States pursuant to this part and under the terms and conditions of an applicable concession contract. The existence of a leasehold surrender interest does not give the concessioner, or any other person, any right to conduct business in a park area, to utilize the related capital improvements, or to prevent the Director or another person from utilizing the related capital improvements. The existence of a leasehold surrender interest does not include any interest in the land on which the related capital improvements are located. \n\nLeasehold surrender interest concession contract means a concession contract that provides for leasehold surrender interest in capital improvements. \n\nLeasehold surrender interest value means the amount of compensation a concessioner is entitled to be paid for a leasehold surrender interest in capital improvements in accordance with this part. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of a leasehold surrender interest concession contract under the authority of section 405(a)(4) of the 1998 Act, leasehold surrender interest value in existing capital improvements is an amount equal to: \n\n(1) The initial construction cost of the related capital improvement; \n\n(2) Adjusted by (increased or decreased) the same percentage increase or decrease as the percentage increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index from the date the Director approves the substantial completion of the construction of the related capital improvement to the date of payment of the leasehold surrender interest value; \n\n(3) Less depreciation of the related capital improvement on the basis of its condition as of the date of termination or expiration of the applicable leasehold surrender interest concession contract, or, if applicable, the date on which a concessioner ceases to utilize a related capital improvement (e.g., where the related capital improvement is taken out of service by the Director pursuant to the terms of a concession contract). \n\nMajor rehabilitation means a planned rehabilitation of an existing structure that the Director determines:\n\n(1) The construction cost of which exceeds thirty percent of the pre-rehabilitation value of the structure; and\n\n(2) Improves visitor health, safety, and enjoyment or the health and safety of concessioner employees and will either enhance the property's overall value, prolong its useful life, or adapt it to new uses.\n\nPre-rehabilitation value of an existing structure means the replacement cost of the structure less depreciation. \n\nReal property improvements means real property other than land, including, but not limited to, capital improvements. \n\nRelated capital improvement or related fixture means a capital improvement in which a concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest. \n\nReplacement cost means the estimated cost to reconstruct, at current prices, an existing structure with utility equivalent to the existing structure, using modern materials and current standards, design and layout. \n\nStructure means a building, dock, or similar edifice affixed to the land so as to be part of the real estate. A structure may include both constructed infrastructure (e.g., water, power and sewer lines) and constructed site improvements (e.g., paved roads, retaining walls, sidewalks, paved driveways, paved parking areas) that are permanently affixed to the land so as to be part of the real estate and that are in direct support of the use of a building, dock, or similar edifice. Landscaping that is integral to the construction of a structure is considered as part of a structure. Interior furnishings that are not fixtures are not part of a structure. \n\nSubstantial completion of a capital improvement means the condition of a capital improvement construction project when the project is substantially complete and ready for use and/or occupancy. \n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90118, Dec. 29, 2023]",

This probable value will be based upon a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested, including any funds required to be placed in special accounts identified in § 51.81, and the obligations of the contract as described in the prospectus.\n\n(b) Each prospectus shall include one of the following:\n\n(1) A proposed franchise fee based on the probable value determination in the prospectus (“prospectus franchise fee”). The prospectus franchise fee should be set at a level to encourage competition for the concession opportunity through offers of either:\n\n(i) Higher franchise fees; or\n\n(ii) Lower franchise fees in combination with enhanced or higher quality service offerings that exceed prospectus requirements.\n\n(2) Alternatively, when the Director determines that using a prospectus franchise fee is inappropriate for the particular concession opportunity, a minimum acceptable franchise fee based on the probable value determination and set at a level to encourage competition.\n\n(c) In determining the minimum acceptable franchise fee or prospectus franchise fee to include in a prospectus, the Director shall use relevant industry data for similar operations (e.g., hospitality, recreation) and provide in the prospectus the basis for the determination of the minimum acceptable franchise fee or prospectus franchise fee. Consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing necessary and appropriate services for public use and enjoyment of the park area in which they are located at reasonable rates.\n\n(d) The franchise fee contained in a concession contract with a term of 5 years or less may not be adjusted during the term of the contract. Concession contracts with a term of more than 5 years will contain a provision that provides for adjustment of the contract's established franchise fee at the request of the concessioner or the Director. An adjustment will occur if the concessioner and the Director mutually determine that extraordinary, unanticipated changes occurred after the effective date of the contract that have affected or will significantly affect the probable value of the privileges granted by the contract. The concession contract will provide for arbitration if the Director and a concessioner cannot agree upon an appropriate adjustment to the franchise fee that reflects the extraordinary, unanticipated changes determined by the concessioner and the Director.\n\n[88 FR 90119, Dec. 29, 2023]",

The construction of capital improvements will be undertaken only pursuant to the leasehold surrender interest provisions of this part and the applicable concession contract. \n\n(b) Concession contracts may contain provisions that require the concessioner to set aside a percentage of its gross receipts or other funds in a component renewal reserve to be used at the direction of the Director solely for renewal of real property components located in park areas and utilized by the concessioner in its operations. The anticipated timing and estimated costs of component renewal projects should be identified in the prospectus. Component renewal reserve funds may not be expended to construct real property improvements, including, without limitation, capital improvements. Component renewal reserve provisions may not be included in concession contracts in lieu of a franchise fee, and funds from these reserves will be expended only for the renewal of real property components as identified in the contract and assigned to the concessioner by the Director for use in its operations. The component renewal reserve provides a mechanism for a concessioner to reserve monies to fund component renewal projects. Concessioner obligations to maintain assigned concession facilities including component renewal are not limited to the monies in the component renewal reserve.\n\n(c) A concession contract must require the concessioner to maintain in good condition through a comprehensive repair and maintenance program all of the concessioner's personal property used in the performance of the concession contract and all real property improvements, including, without limitation, capital improvements, and, government personal property, assigned to the concessioner by a concession contract. \n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90119, Dec. 29, 2023]",

Unless otherwise provided in the concession contract, the reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and changes for facilities, goods and services of comparable character under similar conditions with due consideration to the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Director: length of season; peakloads; average percentage of occupancy; accessibility; availability and cost of labor; and types of patronage.\n\n(c) The Director shall identify the rate approval method to be used for each category of facilities, goods, and services to be provided when preparing the prospectus for a concession contract. The Director will use the least burdensome and most market-based comparability method. Unless the Director determines that market forces are not sufficient to determine reasonable and appropriate rates, the Director shall make a competitive market declaration as the means of comparability, and rates and charges will be approved based upon what the concessioner determines the market will bear. Other rate approval methods will be used only when the Director determines that market forces are inadequate to establish the reasonableness of rates and charges for the facilities, goods, or services. The Director will monitor rates and charges and competition and may change the rate approval method during the term of the contract to reflect changes in market conditions.\n\n(d) Each contract shall include a schedule for rate requests and describe the information necessary to include in a complete rate request. Upon receipt of a request for a change in rates or charges the Director shall, as soon as practicable but not more than 20 days of receipt of the request, provide the concessioner with a written determination that the request is complete, or where the Director determines the request incomplete, a description of the information required for the request to be determined complete. Where changes in rates and charges have been requested and the request has been deemed complete, concessioners shall be allowed to notify visitors making reservations 90 or more days in advance of the anticipated rates. Those rates are subject to adjustment prior to the visit based upon the Director's review and final decision about the requested rate change . The Director shall issue a final decision approving or rejecting a request by a concessioner to change rates and charges to the public within 10 days of receipt of a complete request in accordance with the conditions described in the contract, except for those change requests requiring a full comparability study, for which the Director shall issue a decision as soon as possible and in no event longer than 30 days after receipt of the complete request. If the Director does not approve of the rates and charges proposed by the concessioner, the Director must provide in writing the substantive basis for any disapproval. These timeframes will be exceeded only in extraordinary circumstances and the concessioner must be notified in writing of such circumstances. If the Director fails to meet the timeframes described above, and has not notified the concessioner in writing of the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifying delay, a concessioner may implement the requested change to rates and charges until the Director issues a final written decision. If the Director denies the requested change to rates and charges after implementation by the concessioner, the Director will not require the concessioner to retroactively adjust any rates or charges for services booked prior to the Director's denial.\n\n[65 FR 20668, Apr. 17, 2000, as amended at 88 FR 90119, Dec. 29, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 51.102   What is the effect of the 1998 Act's repeal of the 1965 Act's preference in renewal?\n(a) Section 5 of the 1965 Act required the Secretary to give existing satisfactory concessioners a preference in the renewal (termed a “renewal preference” in the rest of this section) of its concession contract or permit. Section 415 of the 1998 Act repealed this statutory renewal preference as of November 13, 1998. It is the final decision of the Director, subject to the right of appeal set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, that holders of 1965 Act concession contracts are not entitled to be given a renewal preference with respect to such contracts (although they may otherwise qualify for a right of preference regarding such contracts under Sections 403(7) and (8) of the 1998 Act as implemented in this part). However, if a concessioner holds an existing 1965 Act concession contract and the contract makes express reference to a renewal preference, the concessioner may appeal to the Director for recognition of a renewal preference.\n\n(b) Such appeal must be in writing and be received by the Director no later than thirty days after the issuance of a prospectus for a concession contract under this part for which the concessioner asserts a renewal preference. The Director must make a decision on the appeal prior to the proposal submission date specified in the prospectus. Where applicable, the Director will give notice of this appeal to all potential offerors that requested a prospectus. The Director may delegate consideration of such appeals only to a Deputy or Associate Director. The deciding official must prepare a written decision on the appeal, taking into account the content of the appeal and other available information.\n\n(c) If the appeal results in a determination by the Director that the 1965 Act concession contract in question makes express reference to a renewal preference under section 5 of the 1965 Act, the 1998 Act's repeal of section 5 of the 1965 Act was inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the concession contract, and that the holder of the concession contract in these circumstances is entitled to a renewal preference by operation of law, the Director will permit the concessioner to exercise a renewal preference for the contract subject to and in accordance with the otherwise applicable right of preference terms and conditions of this part, including, without limitation, the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus. The Director, similarly, will permit any holder of a 1965 Act concession contract that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order is entitled to a renewal preference, for any reason, to exercise a right of preference in accordance with the otherwise applicable requirements of this part, including, without limitation, the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus.",

The Assessment should summarize the entire system including: Operation and maintenance; employment and training; programs and services; rehabilitation of existing facilities; and the need for new facilities. The Assessment should also describe how the park and recreation system relates to other public and private services. The Assessment consists of six parts which are as follows: \n\n(a) Context. The context should provide: \n\n(1) A short description of the local jurisdiction including: population; economy; geographical location; type of government; how the park department fits into the government structure; how the planning for parks and recreation is achieved; and the relationship to the community's comprehensive planning effort. \n\n(2) A brief descriptive overview of the park and recreation system which includes a discussion of: The populations being served both within and outside of the jurisdiction; the types of services being provided; the degree to which the system is available and accessible to the populations intended to be served; and projected changes in system use. \n\n(3) A discussion of the elements of planning, financing, programming, operation and maintenance, acquisition and development, and other factors common to park and recreation systems and other community services and prospects for future coordination. \n\n(4) A discussion of the approaches and mechanisms used for citizen participation. \n\n(b) Physical Issues. Summary information should be provided on existing facilities including:\n\n(1) Types of facilities and the distribution of acreage and uses at different locations; \n\n(2) Integration of park and recreation planning and facility use with other service agencies such as schools, transportation and housing; \n\n(3) Special facilities for the handicapped or elderly as well as facilities which work to mainstream special populations; \n\n(4) Heavily used non-public or quasi-public facilities; \n\n(5) Facilities of historical and architectural significance which provide recreation and are managed by the park system; \n\n(6) Dependence upon nearby recreation resources outside the local jurisdictions, including public and private resources; \n\n(7) Deficiencies and existing facilities and the needs of the community for new facility development, expansion and/or closure of facilities and the effects of such activities. \n\n(c) Rehabilitation Issues. Summary information should be provided on the need for rehabilitation of facilities. This should include: \n\n(1) Geographic areas needing rehabilitation; \n\n(2) Types of sites and properties for rehabilitation; \n\n(3) Importance of rehabilitation in specific geographic areas; and \n\n(4) Value of rehabilitation over replacement through new facility development. \n\n(d) Service Issues. Summary information on existing services should outline activities and needs in the following areas: \n\n(1) The type, extent and intended beneficiaries of recreation services; \n\n(2) Special programs for the handicapped, elderly, minorities and mainstreaming programs for special populations; \n\n(3) Relationship between and coordination with public and significant non-public programs and private sector groups; \n\n(4) Extent to which park and recreation services relate to other community services including joint programs with schools, social service organizations, historic preservation groups, libraries, or community education facilities; \n\n(5) Coordination with Federal, State (SCORP), regional, county and other jurisdictional plans and activities having direct and indirect impacts on parks and recreation. \n\n(e) Management Issues. Management issues deal with operation of the park and recreation system. Information should summarize the needs and issues of: \n\n(1) Process for developing procedures and policies; \n\n(2) Staffing levels including full-time, seasonal and service personnel, and use of volunteers; \n\n(3) Use of contractual services for recreation programming; \n\n(4) Equipment maintenance and replacement policies; and \n\n(5) Budgeting process, funding cycles and budgets for the past three years and methods of budgeting (such as zero based or performance budgeting). \n\n(f) Conclusions, Implications and Issues.

          "content": "§ 72.13   Action plan.\nThe purpose of the Assessment is to provide background and justification for an Action Plan. The Action Plan, which is the essential core of the Action Program, must be a clear statement of the community's specific objectives, priorities and implementation strategies in relation to the intent of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program and the local government's overall recreation system goals. The Action Plan should be carefully tailored to the comprehensive community goals and directly responsive to the needs and problems identified in § 72.12. Citizen involvement in the development of the Action Plan is required and may include surveys, hearings, meetings, and/or consultation as appropriate. This involvement is essential in the development of goals, objectives and the setting of project priorities. \n\n(a) Goals for the System. This section should set forth the overall goals and specific objectives for the system. Goals will clearly relate to the needs and issues identified in the Assessment and must be projected for at least the five-year life of the Action Program. The goals should be consistent with and, where appropriate, included in the general planning goals of the local government. Where local governments have developed, adopted and are utilizing an overall park and recreation plan, the goals of that plan may be appropriate for this requirement. Goals should be the basis for priorities, schedules and implementation strategies stated in the plan. \n\n(b) Strategies to Address National and Local Concerns. This section should include a description of local strategies for recreation system recovery. A “strategy” defines the total approach to remedying system deficiencies and provides a rationale for priorities reflected in implementation schedules. Strategies should be devised which address the following national concerns: \n\n(1) Ways in which park and recreation plans contribute to, and will be interrelated with, the local government's community development and urban revitalization efforts;\n\n(2) The degree to which park and recreation plans serve citizens who reside in economically-distressed areas of the community and will improve access to park and recreation facilities and programs for minority groups, low- and moderate-income populations, and the handicapped;\n\n(3) The extent to which the Action Program and its plan component will relate employment opportunities for minorities, youth and low- and moderate-income residents;\n\n(4) How the plan seeks to obtain the widest range of beneficial uses of the natural environment and enhances and protects the natural environment;\n\n(5) How park and recreation resources will be targeted in neighborhoods where other neighborhood revitalization efforts are occurring;\n\n(6) How the plan seeks to restore outstanding or unique structures, landscapes, or similar features in parks of historical or architectural significance;\n\n(7) Local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects on the neighborhood level which augment recovery of park and recreation systems;\n\n(8) How the plan will be intergrated with other Federally assisted projects to maximize recreation opportunities;\n\n(9) How the plan will convert for recreation use, derelict and other public lands not designated for recreation; and\n\n(10) Inducements to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs. \n\n(11) How the plan will seek to preserve, restore and develop waterfront areas for recreation and open space.\n\nIf any of the above concerns are not of significance within a locality preparing the Recovery Action Program due to lack of the physical attributes described in the above eleven (11) items, the Action Plan should indicate why such strategies are not appropriate. Most communities will also have their own special concerns and should develop strategies to address them. These should accompany the strategies discussed above and provide a focus for specific recommendations.\n\n(c) Recommendations. Recommendations for improvement of the park and recreation system should be discussed. Each recommendation or group of recommendations should be accompanied by a discussion of the techniques the local government will use to implement the recommendations. Reference should be made to how the recommendations relate to deficiencies, needs, and opportunities identified in previous sections of the Action Program. A brief physical development plan for the entire park and recreation system should be included. This can be accomplished with a map which indicates where existing facilities and activities occur as well as where future developments are to occur. Particular reference shall be made to populations served and indicated deficiencies. \n\n(d) Program Priorities and Implementation Schedule. A statement of system priorities and a schedule for implementation shall be included. These priorities, together with justifying objectives and strategies for implementation shall be presented. Priorities presented will be an important factor in the evaluation and approval of requests for UPARR funding. Active and continued citizen participation is necessary throughout the process. Specific projects to be undertaken and the programs to be improved, expanded, introduced, or eliminated through rehabilitation, physical, service, management, and coordination actions should be discussed. A clear assignment of agency responsibility and an estimate of the costs of implementation should accompany these priorities. \n\n(e) Evaluation and Updating of Action Program. This section should outline a specific program for annual monitoring, evaluating, and updating of the complete Action Program, including both improvements needed in the Assessment and the Action Plan. Citizen involvement is essential in the evaluation and monitoring of the Action Program. Copies of approved Action Programs must be readily available to the public to insure adequate opportunities for citizen review and comment.",

Up to 50 percent matching grants are authorized for the preparation of Recovery Action Programs (RAP). State, local and private in-kind donations of assistance (salaries, supplies, printing, etc.) for the preparation of a RAP may be used as all or part of the 50 percent local match. Such in-kind contributions for the UPARR Program may not be used as the matching share for other federally-assisted programs. In addition, Section 1009 of the Act provides that reasonable local costs of Recovery Action Program development may be used as part of a local match for Innovation or Rehabilitation grants only when the applicant has not received a Recovery Action Program grant. Reasonable costs means costs for supplies, salaries, etc., which are not excessive in relation to the normal market value within a geographic area. These costs must be well documented and included in the preapplication for the proposal in which they are to be used as a match. The match can only be used once, and allowed only after the RAP Has been approved by the respective NPS Regional Office.\n\n(b) Rehabilitation and Innovation grant matching. The program provides for a 70 percent Federal match for rehabilitating existing recreation facilities and areas. Seventy percent matching funds are also authorized to local governments for innovation grants which will address systemwide coordination, management and community resource problems through innovative and cost-effective approaches.\n\n(c) Sources of Matching Share—(1) State Incentive. As an incentive for State involvement in the recovery or urban recreation systems, the Federal government will match, dollar for dollar, State contributions to the local share of an Innovation or Rehabilitation grant; up to 15 percent of the approved grant. The Federal share will not exceed 85 percent of the approved grant. The Director shall also encourage States and private interests to contribute to the non-Federal share of project costs. State and local government shares may be derived from any State or local government source of revenue.\n\n(2) Cash. State, local and private funds may be used as the non-Federal share of project costs. In addition, two types of Federal funds may be used as part of a local match: General Revenue Sharing (Treasury Department) and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program funds (Department of Housing and Urban Development) [See also § 72.56(b)]. Section 1009 of the UPARR Act prohibits use of any other type of Federal grant to match UPARR grants. \n\n(3) Non-Cash—(i) Material goods. NPS encourages in-kind contributions including real property, buildings or building materials, and equipment to applicants by the State, other public agencies, private organizations or individuals. The value of the contributions may be used as all or part of the matching share of project costs, but must be appraised and approved by the Service prior to grant approval. Details regarding these types of donations are covered in OMB Circular A-102. In-kind contributions for the UPARR Program may not be used as the matching share for other Federally-assisted programs.\n\n(ii) Services. Any type of service or assistance which relates directly to a grant and the provision of a recreation opportunity, can be used as a matching share; e.g., technical and planning services, construction labor, playground supervision or management services.",

If the land is not owned by the applicant or sub-grantee, then a non-revocable lease of at least 25 years, or a non-revocable lease providing ample time to amortize the total costs of the proposed activity, must be in effect at the time of grant approval. The lease cannot be revocable at will be the lessor. The costs of acquisition or leasing of land or facilities are not eligible for assistance under the provisions of the Act, section 1014.\n\n(b) The conversion or replacement of properties assisted through UPARR to non-recreation use must be in accord with the current local Recovery Action Program, and approved by the Director. Requests for permission to convert UPARR-assisted properties must be submitted to the Director in writing. The replacement property must assure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonable equivalent location and recreation usefulness. For leased property which is developed or improved with UPARR funds, the grantee, as a condition of the receipt of these funds, must specify in a manner agreed to by the Director, in advance of the conversion, how the converted property will be replaced once the lease expires.\n\n(c) UPARR Program funds may be used to rehabilitate facilities built or develop with LWCF assistance only after a determination is made by NPS that the facility has been maintained in accordance with the LWCF Program.\n\n(d) Applicants must certify that any property acquired after January 2, 1971, and to be improved or enhanced by UPARR assistance, was acquired in conformance with Pub.

No UPARR funds may be passed through for Recovery Action Program grants. The decision on whether or not to pass money through to non-profit organizations or governmental units is made by the applicant jurisdiction which is responsible for the grant; not NPS. Organizations, agencies or governmental units seeking funding assistance on a pass-through basis must work with an applicant jurisdiction in the preparation of the UPARR application, and the applicant jurisdiction will be responsible for the submission of the application. The applicant jurisdiction has full responsibility and liability for funds passed through to subgrantees. In the event of default by the pass-through recipient, the applicant jurisdiction must assume responsibility for ensuring that all provisions of the grant agreement are carried out, including the continued delivery of recreation services resulting from the grant. The pass-through of funds may constitute the entire grant proposal submitted by an applicant jurisdiction, or may be only a portion of it.\n\n(a) Applicant responsibilities. The applicant jurisdiction possesses full responsibility and liability for funds passed-through to subgrantees. It should take precautions to ensure that pass-through agencies can reasonably be expected to comply with grant requirements.\n\n(1) Application requirements. The applicant jurisdiction is responsible for actual preparation and submission of both the pre- and final grant applications. Organizations, agencies or governmental units seeking funding assistance on a pass-through basis must work with the applicant jurisdiction. The applicant jurisdiction may request any or all of the necessary documentation from the subgrantee. It is essential that applicants take precautions to pass-through grants only to reliable and capable agencies or organizations that can reasonably be expected to comply with grant and project requirements.\n\n(2) Recommended pass-through recipient standards. Because the grantee has full responsibility for the pass-through grant, the grantee should ensure that subgrantees meet the following minimum standards.\n\n(i) Demonstrate a history of providing recreation services to the distressed community. The history of providing recreation services must be commensurate with the amount of UPARR assistance requested. A pass-through subgrantee may be a non-profit or neighborhood organization which has provided other social services to the community, or a newly formed, but reliable and capable group which can reasonably be expected to comply with grant and project requirements.\n\n(ii) Take responsibility for the same application, administration and compliance responsibilities as that of the applicant jurisdiction.\n\n(iii) Certify that property improved or developed with UPARR funds will remain dedicated to public recreation use.\n\n(iv) Work through and with the applicant jurisdiction.\n\n(v) Demonstrate that the existing, or soon to be developed, recreation property which it owns or operates is accessible to residents of targeted distressed areas.\n\n(vi) Demonstrate adequate tenure and control of the property to be rehabilitated or used for innovation, through lease or ownership.\n\n(vii) Establish a contractual agreement with the applicant juisdiction which is binding and enforceable to assure that the applicant jurisdiction can adequately meet its contractual obligations under the grant.\n\n(viii) Be empowered to contract or otherwise conduct the activities to be supported as a result of the grant.\n\n(ix) Not discriminate on the basis of residence except in reasonable fee differentials.\n\n(x) Be generally recognized as a provider of service to urban residents.\n\n(xi) Have adequate financial resources, the necessary experience, organization, technical qualifications and facilities; or a firm commitment, arrangement, or ability to obtain such.\n\n(xii) Have an adequate financial management system which provides efficient and effective accountability and control of all property, funds, and assets sufficient to meet grantee needs and grantee audit requirements.\n\n(xiii) Private non-profit agencies or corporations should also be properly incorporated as a non-profit organization with an elected and autonomous board which meets regularly.\n\n(b) Pass-through property and fee limitations. Rehabilitation or Innovation assistance on property not in public ownership, operated by a private non-profit organization through a pass-through grant, will be limited to that portion of the property which directly provides recreation services. Such recreation services must be available to the public on a non-membership, non-fee, or reasonable fee basis, and during reasonable prime time. If a fee is charged or is required for the services resulting through the Rehabilitation or Innovation grant, the fee should be comparable to prevailing local rates for similar services. Charges for recreation services will only be permitted if they do not unfairly jeopardize participation in the recreation service by the disadvantaged population.",

An applicant may apply for UPARR assistance only in an amount which, together with other available public and private resources, is adequate to complete the work approved by the grant agreement. The applicant must document the availability and source of these resources at the time of preapplication for UPARR assistance. Fundable elements in both Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals may include: materials and labor, site planning, architectural and engineering fees, and other costs for activities necessary to complete the approved project. Reasonable architectural and engineering fees essential to the preparation of a proposal application, incurred within a period 9 months prior to preapplication submission to NPS, are reimbursable. Architectural and engineering fees prior to the 9 month period will not be eligible for reimbursement or cost sharing. Other costs incurred prior to approval of any UPARR grant, and fees to consultants for preparation of UPARR grant applications are not reimbursable. No more than 5 percent of the total grant cost may be used by the grantee or pass-through sub-grantee for grant administrative costs. The remaining funds must be made available for projects. Any costs incurred for travel outside the local applicant jurisdiction will not be reimbursable without prior approval from NPS.\n\n(1) Local intent. Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals which provide recreation to residents within a distressed local neighborhood area will be given higher priority. Proposals which have a primary intent to attract or to provide recreation for visitors from outside the applicant jurisdiction, or proposals whose primary objective is the enhancement of the area's economy through the attraction of visitors to the jurisdiction, will not be considered. Innovation proposals which transport residents from distressed neighborhoods to recreation opportunities outside the local jurisdiction, may be considered eligible for funding.\n\n(2) Conservation and energy. Proposals which foster the conservation of energy and natural resources are encouraged; e.g. improvements in accessibility which reduce the need of automobile transportation, efficient use of electrical or other power sources, and water conservation.\n\n(3) Multiple site requests. Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals may request funding for neighborhood-oriented recreation facilities or services which affect the entire recreation system of the applicant jurisdiction, several specific sites or areas, or a single site or area. Innovation proposals which affect multiple facilities or services must be oriented to a single purpose, or one basic innovative category or approach.\n\n(4) Support facilities. The rehabilitation of support facilities for any grant project will be eligible for funding only when such facilities are well defined, are included as part of an overall rehabilitation effort, and provide direct recreation opportunities and benefits to the population being served. Rehabilitation grants may cover costs of remodeling, expanding or developing (see § 72.42) existing outdoor or indoor recreation areas and facilities, including improvements in park landscapes and buildings. Assistance for the rehabilitation of multi-service facilities must be prorated to those elements within the proposal necessary for the provision of recreation opportunities.\n\n(5) Elements excluded from funding. The Act excludes UPARR assistance for major sport arenas, exhibition areas and conference halls used primarily for commercial sports, spectator, or display activities; routine maintenance and upkeep supplies or activities; and for the acquisition of land or interests in land.",

          "content": "§ 72.45   Fundable elements: Innovation grants.\n(a) Innovation grants may cover costs related to improved delivery of recreation services (including personnel, training, facilities, recreation equipment and supplies), except those which pertain to routine operation and maintenance not directly related to the provision of recreation opportunities. All equipment and supply requests in Innovation proposals will be reviewed to assure that they will substantially contribute to the recreation services intended under the specific grant. The intent of Innovation grants is to test new ideas, concepts and approaches aimed at improving facility design, operations or programming in the delivery of neighborhood recreation services. They should also contribute to a systems approach to recreation by linking recreation services with other critical community programs; such as transportation, housing, and health programs. The UPARR Program will competitively choose the best quality Innovation proposals with nationwide demonstration potential, and which serve people who most need the new recreation services. An innovative community recreation project may be a service, a process, an organizational arrangement or a technique. The innovation should demonstrate a concept that is untried, unique, and/or advances the state of the art for recreation. Ideas from successful Innovation proposals will be disseminated nationwide through annual progress reports to Congress, as required in section 1015(b) of the Act, and through the ongoing technical assistance efforts of NPS. Information seminars, workshops and other techniques may also be used to provide the greatest possible exposure of these ideas for use in other communities. Because the legislation limits the yearly funds available for Innovation grants (not more than 10% of funds authorized), the majority of Innovation grants should ideally be monetarily smaller awards aimed at leveraging public and private community support and providing activities with high demonstration value, rather than large-scale development or expansion projects. The long-range intent of funding innovative proposals is to support and demonstrate a great variety of ideas during the five year implementation of the UPARR Program. For this reason, only one or two proposals having a similar emphasis or approach will be funded. Proposed Innovation projects which have been demonstrated before or are currently being operated in other cities, may be considered for UPARR assistance if the application identifies and addresses the question of the special nature or circumstances surrounding the new project.\n\n(1) Program services. Innovation grant costs may include those costs which relate to: demonstrations of the improved multiple-use of public buildings e.g., schools, community centers, libraries; unique program expansions or increases in services; purchase of recreation services on a contractual basis; increased access to recreation areas; and cost-effective management techniques.\n\n(2) Adaptive reuse. In addition to providing services for areas or facilities already in recreation use, Innovation grants may provide funding for the adaptive reuse of areas or facilities not currently in recreation use, or those where mixed community use occurs. Physical rehabilitation of facilities not currently in recreation use (whether public or private) may be funded as part of an Innovation proposal, and would be classified as adaptive reuse. An example would be conversion of an abandoned building to a unique community recreation center. When only a portion of the area or facility will be used for recreation, only that portion will be eligible for UPARR funding.\n\n(3) Supplies. Funds may be used to purchase expendable supplies and equipment which relate directly to an Innovation proposal, such as sports equipment, arts and crafts supplies, chairs and tables if needed for an activity, and essential emergency or safety equipment. General office supplies and furniture not used exclusively to provide recreation services as a part of the proposal, or not an inherent component of the proposal, will not be reimbursable.\n\n(4) Coordination. Local costs incurred for coordinating any grant proposal activities and programs with other public, non-profit or private community services may be reimbursable.\n\n(5) Personnel. Eligible personnel costs for Innovation proposals will be limited to salaries and benefits of those employees directly engaged in the provision of recreation services or formulation of new techniques. Volunteer services may be furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. Each hour of committed volunteer service may be counted toward the local matching share of funds, if the service provided is an integral part of an approved proposal.\n\n(6) Special populations. A proposal which will provide recreation opportunities primarily for a specific demographic group, such as the elderly, youth or handicapped, may be funded. However, the recreation provided must be open to the public, incorporate some activities for the general population, and address needs as identified in the local Recovery Action Program. Services for special populations, such as transportation to recreation facilities, may also be funded.\n\n(b) Basic types of Innovation proposals. Types of Innovation proposals which can be funded are suggested by, but not limited to, the following types:\n\n(1) The unique integration of recreation with other community services; such as transportation, public housing and public safety; either to expand or update current services, or to link programs within the social service structure of a neighborhood, or between neighborhoods. \n\n(2) New management and cost-saving or service-efficient approaches for improving the delivery of recreation services should be fundamental to all Innovation and Rehabilitation proposals, and may also be the prime focus of an Innovation proposal. Extending hours of operation, increasing the variety of recreation programs, contracting with commercial or private non-profit agencies to supply specific recreation services, or assisting citizens in designing and operating their own programs, are examples of management approaches.\n\n(3) New approaches to facility design which emphasize user needs and preferences and promote efficient operation and energy conservation.\n\n(4) New fiscal techniques to generate revenue for continuing operation and maintenance, such as tax credits.\n\n(5) Techniques for improving transportation and access to recreation opportunities.\n\n(6) Techniques to facilitate private, non-profit, and community involvement in providing recreation opportunities.\n\n(7) Improved use of land resources; such as utilizing abandoned railroads and highway rights-of-way, waterfronts, street spaces, or derelict land for recreation.\n\n(8) Adaptive reuse or multiple use of public or private facilities and areas. (Private areas or facilities utilized must be opened to the public.)\n\n(9) Techniques to prevent or reduce crime, abuse and vandalism; such as better design, non-destructible building materials, or use of community volunteers to supervise areas.\n\n(10) Communications and public awareness of recreation opportunities, including education in leisure services; but excluding research.",

The following criteria will be used in evaluating Recovery Action Program grant applications and in deciding priorities for funding:\n\n(1) Degree of need for funds to develop a Recovery Action Program and an ongoing planning process, including the size and complexity of the community's problems, deficiencies in existing planning, and in the capability of the community to initiate and sustain continuing planning efforts.\n\n(2) Degree of the community's commitment to systematic planning, including financial, personnel and time resources already devoted to planning or committed for the future.\n\n(3) Extent to which current park and recreation planning is integrated with overall community planning or would be better integrated as a result of the grant, including use of other Federal or State funds for related planning purposes.\n\n(4) Appropriateness and efficiency of the planning program's work elements (scope, timing, methodology, staffing and costs) in relation to the basic requirements for Recovery Action Programs contained in subpart B, §§ 72.10 through 72.18 (45 FR 15456).\n\n(b) Rehabilitation Grant Selection Criteria. The following criteria will be used to evaluate and rank Rehabilitation proposals: \n\n(1) The Federal UPARR investment per person served by the entire system; relationship between the size of the community and the amount of grant funds requested. Highest priority will be given to proposals with lower per capita costs in relation to recreation benefits provided.\n\n(2) Providing neighborhood recreation needs. Higher priority will be given to proposals serving close-to-home recreation needs, lower priority to those serving area or jurisdiction-wide needs.\n\n(3) Condition of existing recreation properties to be rehabilitated, including the urgency of rehabilitation and the need to maintain existing services.\n\n(4) Improvement in the quality and quantity of recreation services as a result of rehabilitation, including improvements at specific sites and overall enhancement of the recreation system.\n\n(5) Improvement of recreation service to minority and low to moderate income residents, special populations, and distressed neighborhoods.\n\n(6) Proposal's consistency with local government objectives and priorities for overall community revitalization.\n\n(7) Neighborhood employment opportunities created.\n\n(8) State participation in the proposal, including financial and technical assistance.\n\n(9) Private participation by both the non-profit and for-profit sectors in the proposal, including contributions of financial assistance.\n\n(10) Jurisdiction's commitment to implementing its overall Recovery Action Program.\n\n(c) Innovation Grant Selection Criteria. The following criteria will be used to evaluate and rank Innovation proposals:\n\n(1) Degree to which the proposal provides a new, unique or more effective means of delivering a recreation service that can serve as a model for other communities.\n\n(2) Degree of citizen involvement in proposal conceptualization and implementation.\n\n(3) Degree to which the proposal may lead to a positive, systemic change in how park and recreation services are provided. Extent to which the proposal creates opportunities for new partnerships between the people affected, private interests within the community, and public agencies (e.g., Mayor's Office, Recreation Department, Board of Education, Planning Department, social service agencies).\n\n(4) Degree of commitment of community and proposal participants to continue the long term program objectives, including commitments to continue funding after the requested Federal grant money is no longer available. Extent of private resources committed to providing funds or in-kind services for continuing operation and maintenance of projects.\n\n(5) Degree to which proposal managers use the Federal funds to leverage greater public or private investments (in the form of services and materials, as well as dollars).\n\n(6) Degree to which the proposal provides potential coordination with other community, State and Federal programs of community development and those providing recreation to the target population (e.g., public and private non-profit, education programs, CETA for employment, HUD programs).\n\n(7) Extent of improvement in the quality and quantity of recreation services as a result of the Innovation project.\n\n(8) Degree to which the proposal ties in with goals, priorities and implementation strategies expressed in the local park and recreation Recovery Action Program.\n\n(9) Degree to which the proposal leads to a transfer of a recreation role traditionally performed by a public entity, to quasi-public or private non-profit interests. This degree means the degree to which the private sector can take full responsibility, supplement, or fill the gaps in public recreation services, management or operation; either through a transfer of funding responsibility, or an exchange of technique or method approaches which may prove to be more effective under the private sector. This should in no way alter the public sector responsibility to continue to provide and/or monitor good quality recreation facilities and services.\n\n(10) Degree to which a proposal benefits disadvantaged community populations and/or those areas within a distressed community which have the greatest recreation deficiencies.\n\n\nNote:\nInnovation proposals for the adaptive reuse of non-recreation areas or structures, through rehabilitation for recreation should also address rehabilitation selection criteria, particularly the criteria covering Federal investment per person served and the degree to which the proposal would serve close to home recreation needs.",

Grants will be awarded in accordance with the availability of funds. Funding for an approved grant will not be increased from subsequent yearly appropriations.\n\n(b) Applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposals with their NPS Regional Office to determine basic fundability and competitiveness prior to submitting a preapplication.\n\n(c) If a State is assisting the applicant in preapplication preparation, providing a source of matching share, or giving technical assistance, the State may assist in submission of the preapplication to the appropriate NPS Regional Office with the applicant's prior approval. The amount, source and assurance of State assistance for a matching share must be specified in the preapplication. \n\n(d) The following procedural guidelines shall apply to submission and approval of Rehabilitation and Innovation proposals.\n\n(1) Preapplications shall be submitted to the appropriate NPS Regional Office by the chief executive officer of the applicant jurisdiction. The preapplication must include those items as set forth in the Preapplication Handbook, available from any NPS Regional Office. In addition to the narrative on selection criteria, all preapplications for Rehabilitation proposals must include a short description stating; (i) the problem addressed by the proposal, including existing conditions, (ii) the reason for the problem or why the condition exists, and (iii) the proposed solution to the problem and what corrective measures will be used.\n\n(2) An applicant may have no more than one Innovation and one Rehabilitation proposal under consideration in any one funding cycle.\n\n(3) Any existing and/or proposed fees or charges for recreation opportunities or services provided through a UPARR grant, whether for public, private or non-profit activities, must be identified in the preapplication.\n\n(4) Discretionary applicants must submit a narrative statement, signed by the chief executive of the applicant jurisdiction, which explains and quantifies the degree of physical and economic distress in the community. Statistics and discussion on distress shall address, but need not be limited to, the criteria used to select eligible jurisdictions contained in Appendix A of this part. A discretionary narrative statement must be included in each preapplication.\n\n(5) All submitted grant preapplications will be reviewed by NPS Regional Offices to assure that they meet all minimum legal and technical standards before being certified as eligible for competition. Proposals not meeting minimum standards will be returned to the applicant. Periodically, all certified proposals will be evaluated in the Regional Offices before being submitted to Washington, where they will be judged by national panels whose member are knowledgeable in recreation and urban revitalization. Innovation and Rehabilitation proposals will be judged by separate panels.\n\n(6) Following review and ranking by the panels, the Director will approve tentative grant offers for those proposals which may be funded. Successful applicants will be notified by the NPS Regional Offices, and completion of the formal application process will take place. The formal application process must be completed within 120 days of notification of the tentative grant offer, or the tentative grant offer may be withdrawn. Final approval of a grant and obligation of funds will occur when all application requirements have been met and the appropriate documents are on file. No costs may be incurred or reimbursed, except incurred architectural and engineering fees indicated in § 72.44, until NPS approval of the grant agreement.\n\n(7) Unfunded proposals may require modifications to improve their competitiveness. Applicants with such proposals will be advised by NPS of suggested modifications, if any, to increase their chances for funding in future grant rounds.\n\n(8) If an applicant wishes a proposal to remain in competition, it may be considered for two additional funding cycles, with or without minor modifications, before it is returned to the applicant. Major modifications of scope and/or total funding request will require complete resubmission of a proposal as a new preapplication. Applicants who wish to change the scope and/or total funds requested for a proposal which is already in competition, must submit a written request for withdrawal of the previous proposal before submitting a new proposal in the same competition.\n\n(9) The Director reserves the right to withdraw a grant offer if it is determined that any preapplication contains misstatements or misrepresentations of fact, or problems identified which cannot be resolved.",

          "content": "§ 72.72   Conversion requirements.\n(a) Background and legal requirements. The UPARR program has made funds available for the renovation and rehabilitation of numerous urban parks and recreation facilities. In many cases, the UPARR funds were used only in a portion of a site or facility or were only a small percentage of the funds required to renovate or rehabilitate a property. Nevertheless, all recipients of funds for renovation and rehabilitation projects are obligated by the terms of the grant agreement to continually maintain the site or facility for public recreation use regardless of the percent of UPARR funds expended relative to the project and the facility as a whole. This provision is contained in the UPARR Program Administration Guideline (NPS-37) and is also referenced in § 72.36. In accordance with section 1010 of the UPARR Act, no property improved or developed with UPARR assistance shall, without the approval of NPS, be converted to other than public recreation uses. A conversion will only be approved if it is found to be in accord with the current local park and recreation Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans and only upon such conditions as deemed necessary to assure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent location and usefulness. Section 1010 is designed to ensure that areas or facilities receiving UPARR grant assistance are continually maintained in recreation use and available to the general public.\n\n(b) Prerequisites for conversion approval. Requests for permission to convert UPARR assisted properties in whole or in part to other than public recreation uses must be submitted by the recipient to the appropriate NPS Regional Director in writing. NPS will only consider conversion requests if the following prerequisites have been met:\n\n(1) All practical alternatives to the proposed conversion have been evaluated.\n\n(2) The proposed conversion and substitution are in accord with the current Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans. \n\n(3) The proposal assures the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Dependent upon the situation and at the discretion of NPS, the replacement property need not provide identical recreation experiences or be located at the same site, provided it is in a reasonably equivalent location. It must, however, be administered by the same political jurisdiction as the converted property. Equivalent usefulness and location will be determined based on the following criteria: \n\n(i) Property to be converted must be evaluated in order to determine what recreation needs are being fulfilled by the facilities which exist and the types of recreation resources and opportunities available. The property being proposed for substitution must then be evaluated in a similar manner to determine if it will meet recreation needs which are at least like in magnitude and impact to the user community as the converted site. \n\n(ii) Replacement property need not necessarily be directly adjacent to or close by the converted site. This policy provides the administrative flexibility to determine location recognizing that the property should meet existing public recreation needs. While generally this will involve the selection of a site serving the same community(ies) or area as the converted site, there may be exceptions. For example, if property being converted is in an area undergoing major demographic change and the area has no existing or anticipated future need for recreation facilities, then the project sponsor should seek to locate the substitute area in another location within the jurisdiction. \n\n(4) In the case of assisted sites which are partially rather than wholly converted, the impact of the converted portion on the remainder shall be considered. If such a conversion is approved, the unconverted area must remain recreationally viable or be replaced as well. \n\n(5) The guidelines for environmental evaluation have been satisfactorily completed and considered by NPS during its review of the proposed 1010 action. In cases where the proposed conversion arises from another Federal action, final review of the proposal shall not occur until NPS is assured that all environmental review requirements related to that other action have been met. \n\n(6) State intergovernmental clearinghouse review procedures have been adhered to if the proposed conversion and substitution constitute significant changes to the original grant. \n\n(c) Amendments for conversion. All conversions require amendments to the original grant agreement. Amendment requests should be submitted concurrently with conversion requests or at such time as all details of the conversion have been worked out with NPS. Section 1010 project boundary maps shall be submitted with the amendment request to identify the changes to the original area caused by the proposed conversion and to establish a new project area pursuant to the substitution. Once the conversion has been approved, replacement property should be immediately acquired. Exceptions to this rule would occur only when it is not possible for replacement property to be identified prior to the request for the conversion. It will, however, be NPS policy to avoid such a situation if at all possible and to agree only if warranted by exceptional circumstances. In such cases, express commitment to satisfy section 1010 substitution requirements within a specified period, normally not to exceed one year following conversion approval, must be received from the local government agency in the form of a grant amendment. \n\n(d) Obsolete facilities. Recipients are not required to continue operation of a particular facility beyond its useful life. However, when a facility is declared obsolete, the site must nonetheless be maintained in public recreation use following discontinuance of the assisted facility. Failure to so maintain is considered to be a conversion. Requests regarding changes from a UPARR funded facility to another otherwise eligible facility at the same site that significantly contravene the original plans for the area must be made in writing to the Regional Director. NPS approval must be obtained prior to the occurrence of the change. NPS approval is not necessarily required, however, for each and every facility use change. Rather, a project area should be viewed in the context of overall use and should be monitored in this context. A change from UPARR-developed tennis courts to basketball courts, for example, would not require NPS approval. A change from a swimming pool to a less intense area of limited development such as picnic facilities, or vice versa, would, however, require NPS review and approval. To assure that facility changes do not significantly contravene the original project agreement, NPS shall be notified by the recipient of all proposed changes in advance of their occurrence. A primary NPS consideration in the review of requests for changes in use will be the consistency of the proposal with the Recovery Action Program and/or equivalent recreation plans. Changes to other than public recreation use require NPS approval and the substitution of replacement land in accordance with section 1010 of the UPARR Act and paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.",

UPARR policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of residence (refer to § 72.65(b)) including preferential reservation or membership systems on properties improved with UPARR assistance. This prohibition applies to both regularly scheduled and special events. The general provisions regarding non-discrimination at sites assisted under Interior programs and, thereby, all other recreation facilities managed by the recipient, are covered in 43 CFR part 17 which implements the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the Department. \n\n(b) Policy. There shall be no discrimination for UPARR assisted programs or services on the basis of residence, except in reasonable fee differentials. Post-completion compliance responsibilities of the recipient should continue to ensure that discrimination on the basis of residency is not occurring. \n\n(c) Fees. For parks or recreation properties or programs funded with UPARR assistance, fees charged to nonresidents cannot exceed twice that charged to residents. Where there is no charge for residents but a fee is charged to nonresidents, the nonresident fees cannot exceed fees charged at comparable State or local public facilities having fee systems. These fee provisions apply only to the approved 1010 areas applicable to the recipient. Reservation, membership, or annual permit systems available to residents must also be available to nonresidents and the period of availability must be the same for both residents and nonresidents. Recipients are prohibited from providing residents the option of purchasing annual or daily permits while at the same time restricting nonresidents to the purchase of annual permits only.",

Occupational series most commonly associated with museum work are the museum curator series (GS/GM-1015) and the museum technician and specialist series (GS/GM-1016). Other scientific and professional series that may have collateral museum duties include, but are not limited to, the archivist series (GS/GM-1420), the archeologist series (GS/GM-193), the anthropologist series (GS/GM-190), and the historian series (GS/GM-170). In general, grades GS-9 and below are assistants and trainees while grades GS-11 and above are professionals at the full performance level. Grades GS-11 and above are determined according to the level of independent professional responsibility, degree of specialization and scholarship, and the nature, variety, complexity, type, and scope of the work.\n\n(2) The Office of Personnel Management's “Qualification Standards for Positions under the General Schedule (Handbook X-118)” (U.S. Government Printing Office, stock No. 906-030-00000-4 (1986)) establish educational, experience and training requirements for employment with the Federal Government under the various occupational series.

Methods that may be used by Federal agencies to secure curatorial services include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Placing the collection in a repository that is owned, leased or otherwise operated by the Federal agency;\n\n(2) Entering into a contract or purchase order with a repository for curatorial services;\n\n(3) Entering into a cooperative agreement, a memorandum of understanding, a memorandum of agreement or other agreement, as appropriate, with a State, local or Indian tribal repository, a university, museum or other scientific or educational institution that operates or manages a repository, for curatorial services;\n\n(4) Entering into an interagency agreement with another Federal agency for curatorial services;\n\n(5) Transferring the collection to another Federal agency for preservation; and\n\n(6) For archeological activities permitted on public or Indian lands under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470 aa-mm), the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) or other authority, requiring the archeological permittee to provide for curatorial services as a condition to the issuance of the archeological permit.\n\n(b) Guidelines for selecting a repository. (1) When possible, the collection should be deposited in a repository that:\n\n(i) Is in the State of origin;\n\n(ii) Stores and maintains other collections from the same site or project location; or\n\n(iii) Houses collections from a similar geographic region or cultural area.\n\n(2) The collection should not be subdivided and stored at more than a single repository unless such subdivision is necessary to meet special storage, conservation or research needs.\n\n(3) Except when non-federally-owned material remains are retained and disposed of by the owner, material remains and associated records should be deposited in the same repository to maintain the integrity and research value of the collection.\n\n(c) Sources for technical assistance. The Federal Agency Official should consult with persons having expertise in the management and preservation of collections prior to preparing a scope of work or a request for proposals for curatorial services. This will help ensure that the resulting contract, memorandum, agreement or other written instrument meets the needs of the collection, including any special needs in regard to any religious remains. It also will aid the Federal Agency Official in evaluating the qualifications and appropriateness of a repository, and in determining whether the repository has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services for a collection. Persons, agencies, institutions and organizations that may be able to provide technical assistance include, but are not limited to the:\n\n(1) Federal agency's Historic Preservation Officer;\n\n(2) State Historic Preservation Officer;\n\n(3) Tribal Historic Preservation Officer;\n\n(4) State Archeologist;\n\n(5) Curators, collections managers, conservators, archivists, archeologists, historians and anthropologists in Federal and State Government agencies and Indian tribal museum;\n\n(6) Indian tribal elders and religious leaders;\n\n(7) Smithsonian Institution;\n\n(8) American Association of Museums; and\n\n(9) National Park Service.\n\n[55 FR 37630, Sept. 12, 1990; 55 FR 41639, Oct. 12, 1990]",

Those methods include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(a) Federal agencies may fund a variety of curatorial activities using monies appropriated annually by the U.S. Congress, subject to any specific statutory authorities or limitations applicable to a particular agency. As appropriate, curatorial activities that may be funded by Federal agencies include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Purchasing, constructing, leasing, renovating, upgrading, expanding, operating, and maintaining a repository that has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services as set forth in § 79.9 of this part;\n\n(2) Entering into and maintaining on a cost-reimbursable or cost-sharing basis a contract, memorandum, agreement, or other appropriate written instrument with a repository that has the capability to provide adequate long-term curatorial services as set forth in § 79.9 of this part;\n\n(3) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2), reimbursing a grantee for curatorial costs paid by the grantee as a part of the grant project;\n\n(4) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2), reimbursing a State agency for curatorial costs paid by the State agency to carry out the historic preservation responsibilities of the Federal agency;\n\n(5) Conducting inspections and inventories in accordance with § 79.11 of this part; and\n\n(6) When a repository that is housing and maintaining a collection can no longer provide adequate long-term curatorial services, as set forth in § 79.9 of this part, either:\n\n(i) Providing such funds or services as may be agreed upon pursuant to § 79.5(a)(1) of this part to assist the repository in eliminating the deficiencies; or\n\n(ii) Removing the collection from the repository and depositing it in another repository that can provide curatorial services in accordance with the regulations in this part.\n\n(b) As authorized under section 110(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470h-2) and section 208(2) of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469c-2), for federally licensed or permitted projects or programs, Federal agencies may charge licensees and permittees reasonable costs for curatorial activities associated with identification, surveys, evaluation and data recovery as a condition to the issuance of a Federal license or permit.\n\n(c) Federal agencies may deposit collections in a repository that agrees to provide curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government. This generally occurs when a collection is excavated or removed from public or Indian lands under a research permit issued pursuant to the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) or the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm). A repository also may agree to provide curatorial services as a public service or as a means of ensuring direct access to a collection for long-term study and use. Federal agencies should ensure that a repository that agrees to provide curatorial services at no cost to the U.S. Government has sufficient financial resources to support its operations and any needed improvements.\n\n(d) Funds provided to a repository for curatorial services should include costs for initially processing, cataloging and accessioning the collection as well as costs for storing, inspecting, inventorying, maintaining, and conserving the collection on a long-term basis.\n\n(1) Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection to be generated during identification and evaluation surveys should be included in project planning budgets.\n\n(2) Funds to initially process, catalog and accession a collection to be generated during data recovery operations should be included in project mitigation budgets.\n\n(3) Funds to store, inspect, inventory, maintain and conserve a collection on a long-term basis should be included in annual operating budgets.\n\n(e) When the Federal Agency Official determines that data recovery costs may exceed the one percent limitation contained in the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469c), as authorized under section 208(3) of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments (16 U.S.C. 469c-2), the limitation may be waived, in appropriate cases, after the Federal Agency Official has:\n\n(1) Obtained the concurrence of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior by sending a written request to the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, National Park Service, P.O.

In order to be eligible for disposal under this subpart, material remains from collections must be:\n\n(1) Archaeological resources, as defined in the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470bb(1)), or other resources excavated and removed under the Reservoir Salvage Act (54 U.S.C. 312501-312508) or the Antiquities Act (54 U.S.C. 320301-320303); and\n\n(2) Considered to be of insufficient archeological interest under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section, based on the definition of “of archaeological interest” in 43 CFR 7.3(a)(1).\n\n(b) Which material remains are not eligible for disposal under this subpart? The following material remains from collections are not eligible for disposal under this subpart:\n\n(1) Native American “cultural items” as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (25 U.S.C. 3001(3)), because disposition is governed by that Act and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 10);\n\n(2) Other human remains not subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990;\n\n(3) Material remains excavated and removed from Indian lands on or before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) on October 31, 1979; and\n\n(4) Material remains excavated and removed from Indian lands under the Antiquities Act (54 U.S.C. 320301-320303).\n\n(c) Who may propose the disposal of particular material remains? The following individuals who meet the applicable Professional Qualification Standards set by the Secretary of the Interior may propose the disposal of particular material remains from a collection:\n\n(1) Federal agency staff members with verifiable knowledge of the particular material remains, including archeologists, curators, and conservators; and\n\n(2) Qualified museum professionals located in a repository that provides curatorial services for a collection held in that repository.\n\n(d) Who is responsible for the disposal of particular material remains? The Federal Agency Official is responsible for ensuring that particular material remains are disposed of according to the requirements of this subpart.\n\n(e) When are particular material remains considered to be of insufficient archeological interest? Particular material remains are considered to be of insufficient archeological interest when, on a case-by-case basis, at least one qualified archeological or museum professional who meets the Professional Qualification Standards set by the Secretary of the Interior and possesses verifiable knowledge of and experience in the type of material remains being evaluated makes a determination. The determination must follow the process established in § 79.15 and document that:\n\n(1) Disposition of the material remains will not negatively impact the overall integrity of the original collection recovered during the survey, excavation, or other study of a prehistoric or historic resource; and\n\n(2) At least one of the following three requirements—lack of provenience information; lack of physical integrity; or overly redundant and not useful for research—are met:\n\n(i) Lack of provenience information. Lack of provenience information may be established after a concerted effort to recover the information in the related associated records is performed and documented and by one or more of the following circumstances:\n\n(A) The labels on the material remains or the labels on the containers that hold the material remains do not provide adequate information to reliably establish meaningful archeological context for the material remains;\n\n(B) The labels on the material remains or the labels on the containers that hold the material remains have been lost or destroyed over time and cannot be reconstructed through the associated records; or\n\n(C) The associated records of the material remains never existed, have been lost, or have been destroyed.\n\n(ii) Lack of physical integrity. Material remains lack physical integrity when, subsequent to recovery during the survey, excavation, or other study of a prehistoric or historic resource, the material remains were irreparably damaged through decay, decomposition, or inadvertent loss. Examples may include human-caused incidents, exposure to elements, or natural disaster.\n\n(iii) Overly redundant and not useful for research. Material remains are overly redundant and not useful for research in light of the collection's archeological context, research questions, and research potential. These considerations may vary based on geography, time and culture period, scientific or cultural significance, prior analysis, and other factors. Because it is difficult to predict if future analytical methods will yield useful information about the material remains proposed for disposal, a sample of the material remains deemed to be overly redundant and not useful for research must be retained for curation, as required by § 79.15(f).",

This paragraph applies to material remains that are determined to be of insufficient archeological interest under § 79.12(e) and that were excavated or removed from Indian lands after October 31, 1979. Under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm), these material remains are the property of the Indian individual or Indian tribe having rights of ownership over the resources. Under the authority of 16 U.S.C. 470dd, disposition of these material remains is subject to the consent of the Indian individual or Indian tribe. The Federal Agency Official must use the following methods of disposal for these material remains in the following order:\n\n(1) Return them to the Indian individual or Indian tribe having rights of ownership under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act's custody regulations, 43 CFR 7.13(b), 36 CFR 296.13(b), 32 CFR 229.13(b), and 18 CFR 1312.13(b).\n\n(2) If the Indian individual or Indian tribe having rights of ownership does not wish to accept and take physical custody of the material remains, the Federal Agency Official may otherwise dispose of the material remains using the disposition methods in paragraph (b) of this section after receiving written consent and relinquishment of ownership from the Indian individual or Indian tribe having rights of ownership.\n\n(b) Public lands. This paragraph applies to material remains that are determined to be of insufficient archeological interest under § 79.12(e) and that were excavated or removed from public lands that are not Indian lands. As a condition of disposal, the Federal Agency Official will reasonably ensure that material remains from such lands may not be traded, sold, bought, or bartered after disposal. The Federal Agency Official must consider the following methods for disposal of the material remains:\n\n(1) Transfer to another Federal agency.\n\n(2) Convey to a suitable public or tribal scientific or professional repository as defined in § 79.4(k) of this part.\n\n(3) Convey to a federally recognized Indian tribe if the material remains were excavated or removed from lands of religious or cultural importance to that tribe and were identified and documented by a Federal land manager under 43 CFR 7.7(b)(1), 36 CFR 296.7(b)(1), 32 CFR 229.7(b)(1), or 18 CFR 1312.7(b)(1).\n\n(4) Convey to a federally recognized Indian tribe from whose aboriginal lands the material remains were removed. Aboriginal occupation may be documented by evidence including, but not limited to, a final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or the United States Court of Claims, or a treaty, Act of Congress, or Executive Order.\n\n(5) Convey to a federally recognized Indian tribe for the purpose of traditional cultural, educational, or religious practices.\n\n(6) Transfer within the Federal agency for the purpose of education or interpretation, or convey to a suitable institution to be used for public benefit and education including, but not limited to, local historical societies, museums, university or college departments, and schools.\n\n(7) If the Federal Agency Official considers each of these prior methods carefully and is still unable to find an acceptable method of disposition, then the material remains may be destroyed. The Federal Agency Official or their designee must witness and document the destruction, including through photography or video as practicable.",

A determination made under this subpart in no way affects a Federal land manager's obligations under other applicable laws or regulations. The Federal Agency Official must take all the following actions before making a final determination that it is appropriate to dispose of material remains.\n\n(a) The Federal Agency Official must determine that the material remains are eligible for disposal under the criteria in § 79.12(a).\n\n(b) The Federal Agency Official must verify in writing that none of the material remains proposed for disposal meet the criteria in § 79.12(b).\n\n(c) The Federal Agency Official must verify that the material remains proposed for disposal are appropriately documented through a professional procedure approved by the Federal agency that is consistent with curatorial services, including accessioning and cataloging, as defined in § 79.4(b).\n\n(d) The Federal Agency Official must consult with qualified museum professionals located in the repository that provides curatorial services for the material remains proposed for disposal if those museum professionals did not propose the disposal under § 79.12(c)(2). This consultation with the qualified museum professionals must address the appropriateness of the proposed disposal.\n\n(e) The Federal Agency Official must establish a collections advisory committee of at least five members to review proposed dispositions of material remains. The committee must make a consensus recommendation to the Federal Agency Official about each proposed disposition based on the adequacy of the documentation addressing the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the appropriateness of the proposed disposition based on the criteria in § 79.12(e).\n\n(1) The collections advisory committee must consist of qualified employees from Federal agencies who meet appropriate Professional Qualification Standards set by the Secretary of the Interior, and must include the curator and the principal archeologist of the Federal agency that owns or administers the material remains if either or both of these two positions exist. The Departmental Consulting Archeologist may not participate on the collections advisory committee. If the Departmental Consulting Archeologist is the principal archeologist, then the Federal Agency Official must designate another qualified archeologist at the agency instead.\n\n(2) Collections advisory committee members must include Federal employees with subject matter or technical expertise in the object types, cultural period, and culture area of the proposed disposition. These employees may include archeologists, anthropologists, curators, and conservators with expertise in historic, prehistoric, or underwater material remains.\n\n(3) If the material remains being proposed for disposal are Native American, then collections advisory committee members must also include at least one or more individuals who are Tribal Officials acting in their official capacities representing their respective federally recognized Indian tribes that are regularly consulted by the Federal agency regarding the collection containing the material remains being proposed for disposal.\n\n(4) The collections advisory committee must have written procedures and governing rules, including terms of member appointments and the duration of the committee, approved by the Federal Agency Official, to ensure all recommendations about the appropriateness of disposal are fair, open, timely, and in the best interests of the public.\n\n(5) The collections advisory committee must submit a written report to the Federal Agency Official for each proposed disposition that, at a minimum, documents the information required for the Federal Register notice identified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section; membership of the committee and each member's role and expertise pertinent to the proposed disposition; a summary of any comments received on the proposed disposition under paragraph (h) of this section; the recommendations for disposition, including any conditions of transfer or conveyance; and the reasons why other methods of disposal would be of lesser public benefit.\n\n(6) Federal employees or qualified members of federally recognized Indian tribes may be temporarily added to the committee if its existing members determine that specific expertise, including archeological knowledge of the cultural period and cultural area, is needed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(7) Collections advisory committee members, whether permanent or temporary, and their family members may not benefit financially or in any other way from a disposition of material remains, except to the extent that members of a federally recognized Indian Tribe, when that Indian Tribe is being considered as a potential recipient of material remains, may participate in the collections advisory committee as described in § 79.15(e)(3).\n\n(f) The Federal Agency Official must retain in the curated collection a sample of those material remains determined to be overly redundant and not useful for research that is representative of the population as a whole from which the sample was taken.\n\n(1) The size of the representative sample must be large enough to permit future analysis for research purposes.\n\n(2) The method for establishing a representative sample, including sample size and typology, must be determined by a qualified museum or archeological professional with expertise in the type of prehistoric or historic material remains being sampled.\n\n(3) The sampling method must be documented and consistent with professional prehistoric or historic archeological practice.\n\n(g) The Federal Agency Official must retain all associated records in the archeological collection as defined in § 79.4(a)(2). A copy of the original associated records must be given to the recipient of any transferred or conveyed items subject to the restrictions stipulated in the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470hh(a)). For material remains excavated and removed from Indian land, a copy of the original associated records must be given to the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (or other designated tribal representative) from the tribal land where the material remains were recovered.\n\n(h) The Federal Agency Official must notify the entities listed in this paragraph of the proposed disposition and solicit comments on the proposal. Notifications must be made in writing, and must include a deadline for submitting comments that is at least 60 days after notice is issued, in accordance with procedures established by the Federal agency. All written comments must be reviewed by the Federal Agency Official and the collections advisory committee. The Federal Agency Official will respond to all relevant, substantive comments received. Notice must be given to the following:\n\n(1) The State Historic Preservation Officer and, where established, the State Archeologist, from the state(s) where the material remains to be disposed of were recovered.\n\n(2) The Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (or other designated tribal representative) from the Indian land(s) where the material remains to be disposed of were recovered.\n\n(3) Federal, state, tribal, or local agencies that were involved in the recovery of the material remains to be disposed of.\n\n(4) Private landowners from whose lands the material remains to be disposed of were removed, but only in such cases where the Federal agency obtained practical management authority over the material remains as the result of activities conducted in connection with a Federal action, assistance, license, or permit, on those private lands.\n\n(5) Universities, museums, scientific institutions, and educational institutions with which the agency has an existing relationship pursuant to a written instrument (e.g., permit, agreement) for research, excavation, curation, education, or other partnership in the state and region from which the material remains to be disposed of were recovered.\n\n(6) Indian tribes that consider the land to have religious or cultural importance, if the material remains are from a site on public lands that has religious or cultural importance to Indian tribes under 43 CFR 7.7(b)(1).\n\n(7) Indian tribes from whose aboriginal lands the material remains were removed, if aboriginal occupation has been documented by a final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or the United States Court of Claims, treaty, Act of Congress, or Executive Order.\n\n(i) The Federal Agency Official must, after the comment period described in paragraph (h) of this section has expired and the Federal Agency Official has responded to all relevant, substantive comments received, publish a notice of determination of disposition in the Federal Register.\n\n(1) The notice published in the Federal Register must include the following:\n\n(i) A general description of the material remains to be disposed.\n\n(ii) The criteria used to determine that the material remains are of insufficient archeological interest under § 79.12(e).\n\n(iii) The method of disposal.\n\n(iv) The name of the Federal Agency Official or their designee as a point of contact.\n\n(v) An explanation of a person's right to object to the determination of disposition under § 79.16 and the name, email, and physical address of the Departmental Consulting Archeologist.\n\n(2) The Federal Agency Official must also prepare a determination of disposition that includes the following:\n\n(i) A detailed list of the material remains to be disposed, including a description of each object, or lot of objects if there are multiples of a particular type, and photograph(s) of the objects when appropriate.\n\n(ii) The report of the collections advisory committee as stipulated in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.\n\n(iii) Documentation that all of the procedures in § 79.15 have been met.\n\n(iv) The name of the recipient entity or method of disposal, as appropriate.\n\n(v) Justification of the method to be used to dispose of the material remains under § 79.13.\n\n(vi) The name of the Federal Agency Official or their designee as a point of contact.\n\n(vii) Other conditions of transfer or conveyance, as appropriate.\n\n(viii) A statement that the determination is a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704) unless an objection is filed in accordance with § 79.16.",

          "content": "§ 200.2   Field organization.\nThe field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, stations, and areas as described below: \n\n(a) Regions of the National Forest System. For the purpose of managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to that region. Within each region are located national forests and other lands of the Forest Service.\n\n(1) National Forests. Each Forest has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor. \n\n(2) Ranger districts. Each district may include a portion of a national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor. \n\n(b) Forest and rangeland research coordination. The field research program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work nationwide and internationally.\n\n(c) State and private forestry cooperation. Field level cooperation between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible for State and private forestry activities within those regions.\n\n(d) International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Institute is managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and directing research, science and technology exchange, technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.\n\n(e) Field addresses. The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station Directors, and Area Directors are given below.

The basic laws authorizing activities of the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35. \n\n(b) Work of the Forest Service. Under delegated authority from the Secretary of Agriculture, the broad responsibilities of the Forest Service are: \n\n(1) Leadership in forestry. The Forest Service provides overall leadership in forest and forest-range conservation, development, and use. This involves determination of forestry conditions and requirements, and recommendations of policies and programs needed to keep the Nation's private and public lands fully productive. \n\n(2) National Forest System administration. (i) The Forest Service administers and manages the National Forest System lands in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of August 17, 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614); and the National Forest Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a, 476, 500, 513-516, 521b; 576b, 1600-1602, 1604, 1606, 1608-1614). \n\n(ii) The National Forest System comprises about 188 million acres of land in the National Forests, National Grasslands, and other areas which have been transferred to the Forest Service for administration. On these public lands:\n\n(A) Forestry methods are applied in growing and harvesting timber, \n\n(B) Forage is scientifically managed for the use of domestic livestock whose numbers are kept in balance with the carrying capacity of the range, \n\n(C) Wildlife habitat and species are managed, \n\n(D) Watersheds are managed to safeguard the water supply and stabilize streamflow, \n\n(E) Recreation resources are managed for public enjoyment and benefit, \n\n(F) Many forms of land and resource use are granted under permit or lease, and \n\n(G) Physical and resource improvements needed to develop, protect, and use all resources are built and maintained. \n\n(3) Cooperative forestry. The Forest Service carries out cooperative forestry programs for public benefit through programs initiated by State, county, and other Federal agencies in accordance with the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of July 1, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101-2111). These programs are directed at the protection, development, and sustained production of all forestry resources, both public and private. \n\n(4) Forest research. The Forest Service conducts research on problems involving protection, development, management, renewal, and continuous use of all resources, products, values, and services of forest lands in accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of June 30, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641-1647). Research is conducted on: \n\n(i) Forest and range management, including the five basic resources of timber, forest soil and water, range forage, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest recreation, \n\n(ii) Forest protection from fire, insects, and disease, \n\n(iii) Forest products and engineering, and \n\n(iv) Forest resource economics including forest survey, forest economics, and forest products marketing.\n\n[44 FR 37505, June 27, 1979]",

The Forest Service charges a fee for copies of records not generally made available to the public but released pursuant to a FOIA request in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the Department of Agriculture at 7 CFR Part 1, Subpart A, Appendix A. These fees do not apply to information that is generally and routinely made available to the public upon request, such as recreational brochures, pamphlets, maps, and technical guides as well as agency directive issuances. Separate charges for such general information are established in the agency's Directive System (§ 200.4). For example, some pamphlets and small segments of the Forest Service Manual and Handbook may be provided at no cost, but maps of the National Forest System and larger sections of the Manual and Handbook are available for a charge. Current charges are explained at the time the request is made.\n\n[62 FR 13540, Mar. 21, 1997]",

Acceptable security for a payment bond includes Department of the Treasury approved corporate sureties, Federal Government obligations, and irrevocable letters of credit. For the purposes of this section, a non-Government cooperator is an entity that is not a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, a federally recognized Indian Tribe (as defined by the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 [25 U.S.C. 479a]), or other organizations funding a Forest Service agreement with pass through funding from an entity that is a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, or federally recognized Indian Tribe.\n\n(d) Avoiding conflict of interest. Forest Service officers shall avoid acceptance of contributions from cooperators when such contributions would reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Forest Service to carry out its responsibilities and duties. Forest Service officers shall be guided by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. parts 201-209, 5 CFR part 2635, and applicable Department of Agriculture regulations, in determining if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists in a proposed cooperative effort. Forest Service ethics officials or the designated Department of Agriculture ethics official should be consulted on conflict of interest issues.\n\n[64 FR 60678, Nov. 8, 1999, as amended at 73 FR 62443, Oct. 21, 2008]",

Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this section shall apply to all National Forest System roads under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service except when in conflict with written agreement.\n\n(1) General. Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where applicable except when in conflict with designations established under subpart B of this part or with the rules at 36 CFR part 261.\n\n(2) Specific. The following specific traffic rules shall apply unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.\n\n(i) The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part 261.\n\n(ii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Classes of vehicles may include but are not limited to distinguishable groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive vehicles, off-highway vehicles, and trailers. Types of traffic may include but are not limited to groupings such as commercial hauling, recreation, and administrative. \n\n(iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use as provided in 36 CFR part 261.\n\n(iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.\n\n(b) Road system—(1) Identification of road system. For each national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other units of the National Forest System (§ 212.1), the responsible official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system, the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part 219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance. \n\n(2) Identification of unneeded roads. Responsible officials must review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives and that, therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other uses, such as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads to a more natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, but are not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage patterns, stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the entrance to the road, installing water bars, removing culverts, reestablishing drainage-ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders, scattering slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes, or other methods designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded road. Forest officials should give priority to decommissioning those unneeded roads that pose the greatest risk to public safety or to environmental degradation.\n\n(c) Cost recovery on National Forest System roads. The Chief may determine that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in accordance with § 212.9. This condition to use roads would apply where the owners or haulers: \n\n(1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvements, and \n\n(2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of the costs. \n\n(d) Maintenance and reconstruction of National Forest System roads by users—(1) Maintenance. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other than that commensurate with his use. \n\n(2) Reconstruction. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate his use. \n\n(3) Deposits in lieu of performance. If the maintenance or reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be used for the purposes deposited, except that: \n\n(i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, and \n\n(ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or refunded. \n\n(e) Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator. Any fees or other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for making these payments. \n\n[39 FR 27649, July 31, 1974, as amended at 42 FR 2957, Jan. 14, 1977; 43 FR 20007, May 10, 1978; 62 FR 58654, Oct. 30, 1997.

In those instances where the values of the interests needed by the United States exceed those applied for by the applicant, the additional interests required by the United States will be acquired as provided in § 212.7(b) and (c). Where values needed by the applicant exceed those needed by the United States, the difference in values will be determined under principles set forth below and in §§ 212.5(c) and 212.9. If a reciprocal benefit is not needed by the United States, or the applicant shows good cause why the reciprocal benefit needed by the United States cannot or should not be granted by him, or the applicant declines to grant the reciprocal benefit requested by the United States or if a bona fide emergency exists, permission to construct or use a road across lands owned by the United States may be conditioned for any applicant upon reasonable charges and all other terms and conditions required by the Chief to protect the interests of the United States. Permits for such road construction or use will be non-exclusive and will be conditioned upon compliance with their terms and conditions and with the rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and those applicable to such roads. \n\n(b) [Reserved] \n\n(c) Replacement of prior grants. (1) Upon application to the Chief, an easement under the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1233, 16 U.S.C. 525), shall be replaced by an easement under paragraph (d) of this section. \n\n(2) Upon application to the Chief, an easement shall be granted under paragraph (d) of this section as a replacement for any stipulations for ingress and egress issued under the Act of June 4, 1897 or permit or other document evidencing the applicant's right to use a road: Provided, The applicant has met the requirements for obtaining such easement as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. \n\n(d) Easements for roads crossing lands or easements administered by the Forest Service. (1) Applications for permanent or temporary easements for specified periods or otherwise to be granted under the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1039, 16 U.S.C. 533), over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service, or over roads thereon will be approved by the Chief for those applicants who have conveyed or provided appropriate easements over roads, assignable easements and lands owned or controlled by them to the United States of America and its assigns and who have already constructed, or will, as scheduled by agreement, construct their proportionate share of the road or road system of which the segments described in the application are parts. The Chief, after approval of the application and the grant of the easement, will cause the same to be entered in the records of the Forest Service, and delivered to the applicant. \n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Chief may grant to the applicant a permanent or temporary easement for specified periods or otherwise upon such exchange of easements or share-cost arrangement or other reasonable consideration as he may deem appropriate. \n\n(3) The Chief may grant to a State or local subdivision thereof; easements for roads over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service and over roads thereon, when the roads thereon or roads to be constructed thereon will serve said lands and are, or will become a part of the road system maintained by such State or local subdivision for general public use: Provided, That easements shall not be granted under authority of this act (78 Stat. 1089), 16 U.S.C. 533 which may be granted under the Highway Act (72 Stat. 916, 23 U.S.C. 317), as amended. The easements shall contain such provisions, terms, and conditions as the Chief may determine are necessary to retain and protect the interests needed by the United States. \n\n(4) All instruments affecting permanent interests in land executed pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section shall be recorded in each county where the lands are located. Copies of all instruments affecting interests in lands reserved from public domain shall be furnished by the Chief to the Secretary of the Interior. \n\n(5)(i) The Chief may revoke an easement granted under 36 CFR 251.53(j):\n\n(A) With the grantee's consent;\n\n(B) By condemnation; or\n\n(C) After a 5-year period of nonuse by the grantee.\n\n(ii) Before revocation of an easement granted under 36 CFR 251.53(j) for nonuse, a formal adjudicatory proceeding must be conducted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1, subpart H, provided the grantee requests the hearing within 60 days of receipt of the notice of revocation.\n\n(25 Stat. 357, 26 Stat. 1103, 30 Stat. 35-36, 1233, 38 Stat. 430, 46 Stat. 1421, 64 Stat. 82, 72 Stat. 885, as amended, 74 Stat. 215, 78 Stat. 1089; 16 U.S.C. 471, 478, 498, 525, 528-531, 532, 538, 551, 572, 23 U.S.C. 101, 205, 40 U.S.C. 257, 258a et seq.; 42 Atty.

          "content": "§ 212.9   Principles for sharing use of roads.\nThe use of roads under arrangements for sharing costs or performance shall be in accordance with the following: \n\n(a) Road improvement. Use of a road for commercial hauling, except occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements or supplemental construction in lieu of performance. Such funds will be used by the Forest Service to do the planned work. The cost of the improvements or supplemental construction will be taken into account in determining any otherwise required contribution to cover the proportionate share of the cost of road acquisition, construction, reconstruction or improvement attributable to the use. \n\n(b) Corresponding benefits. Corresponding benefits which may be accepted by the Chief for sharing road use will be those which bear a reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the Forest Service. They may be in the form of: \n\n(1) Deposit of funds with the Forest Service for use in paying the cost of road construction, reconstruction, or improvement to be borne by the user; \n\n(2) The grant of a reciprocal right of substantially similar value to the road use sought; \n\n(3) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement by applicant of a road needed for access to and use of lands administered by the Forest Service; or (4) any combination of these. \n\n(c) Cost determinations for roads cooperatively constructed under agreements. When roads are constructed under cooperative agreements to meet mutual needs of the United States and others for access, determinations of the shares of costs to be borne by the United States and the cooperating parties will include consideration of: \n\n(1) The standard of road required for the planned hauling; \n\n(2) The share of planned use;\n\n(3) The location and volume of tributary timber owned by each party and expected to be hauled over the road or roads; \n\n(4) The tributary areas owned or controlled by each party; \n\n(5) Expected use by the public; and \n\n(6) Other appropriate considerations. \n\n(d) Cost recovery by the United States from others. When roads are used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service. \n\n(e) Cost sharing with a cooperator. The costs to achieve the agreed upon road or road system may be met by: \n\n(1) Use of appropriated funds; \n\n(2) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement of roads or segments of roads by purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service or other users; \n\n(3) Use of deposits made by cooperator with the Forest Service to cover cooperator's agreed share; \n\n(4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount specified in the agreement; or \n\n(5) A combination of the aforementioned methods. \n\n(f) Road maintenance and resurfacing. Cooperators will share the road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with § 212.5(d). \n\n(g) Interests to be acquired by the United States in roads or easements therefor. Where the United States is to bear or share the cost of constructing or improving, or acquiring a road system, a road, or a segment thereof, or acquires an easement therefor, the interest acquired will: \n\n(1) Be for perpetual use unless the road use falls within the limited classes where temporary roads or roads for limited periods are acceptable; \n\n(2) Provide adequately for foreseeable management, protection, and utilization needs of lands administered by the Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands and for the use and development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent to the National Forest are dependent; and \n\n(3) not be subject to conditions, reservations, or convenants unrelated to the road use, or which seek or might tend to direct or limit policies and procedures for management of lands administered by the Forest Service. \n\n(25 Stat. 357, 26 Stat. 1103, 30 Stat. 35-36, 1233, 38 Stat. 430, 46 Stat. 1421, 64 Stat. 82, 72 Stat. 885, as amended, 74 Stat. 215, 78 Stat. 1089; 16 U.S.C. 471, 478, 498, 525, 528-531, 532, 538, 551, 572, 23 U.S.C. 101, 205, 40 U.S.C. 257, 258a et seq.; 42 Atty.

(NFMA). This subpart also sets out the requirements for plan components and other content in land management plans. This part is applicable to all units of the NFS as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609 or subsequent statute.\n\n(b) Consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531) (MUSYA), the Forest Service manages the NFS to sustain the multiple use of its renewable resources in perpetuity while maintaining the long-term health and productivity of the land. Resources are managed through a combination of approaches and concepts for the benefit of human communities and natural resources. Land management plans guide sustainable, integrated resource management of the resources within the plan area in the context of the broader landscape, giving due consideration to the relative values of the various resources in particular areas.\n\n(c) The purpose of this part is to guide the collaborative and science-based development, amendment, and revision of land management plans that promote the ecological integrity of national forests and grasslands and other administrative units of the NFS. Plans will guide management of NFS lands so that they are ecologically sustainable and contribute to social and economic sustainability; consist of ecosystems and watersheds with ecological integrity and diverse plant and animal communities; and have the capacity to provide people and communities with ecosystem services and multiple uses that provide a range of social, economic, and ecological benefits for the present and into the future. These benefits include clean air and water; habitat for fish, wildlife, and plant communities; and opportunities for recreational, spiritual, educational, and cultural benefits.\n\n(d) This part does not affect treaty rights or valid existing rights established by statute or legal instruments.\n\n(e) During the planning process, the responsible official shall comply with Section 8106 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (25 U.S.C. 3056), Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996, Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, laws, and other requirements with respect to disclosing or withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) certain information regarding reburial sites or other information that is culturally sensitive to an Indian Tribe or Tribes.\n\n(f) Plans must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including NFMA, MUSYA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Endangered Species Act.\n\n(g) The responsible official shall ensure that the planning process, plan components, and other plan content are within Forest Service authority, the inherent capability of the plan area, and the fiscal capability of the unit.",

          "content": "§ 219.2   Levels of planning and responsible officials.\nForest Service planning occurs at different organizational levels and geographic scales. Planning occurs at three levels—national strategic planning, NFS unit planning, and project or activity planning.\n\n(a) National strategic planning. The Chief of the Forest Service is responsible for national planning, such as preparation of the Forest Service strategic plan required under the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1115-1125; 31 U.S.C. 9703-9704), which is integrated with the requirements of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the NFMA. The strategic plan establishes goals, objectives, performance measures, and strategies for management of the NFS, as well as the other Forest Service mission areas: Research and Development, State and Private Forestry, and International Programs.\n\n(b) National Forest System unit planning. (1) NFS unit planning results in the development, amendment, or revision of a land management plan. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated resource management and for guiding project and activity decisionmaking on a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit. A plan reflects the unit's expected distinctive roles and contributions to the local area, region, and Nation, and the roles for which the plan area is best suited, considering the Agency's mission, the unit's unique capabilities, and the resources and management of other lands in the vicinity. Through the adaptive planning cycle set forth in this subpart, a plan can be changed to reflect new information and changing conditions.\n\n(2) A plan does not authorize projects or activities or commit the Forest Service to take action. A plan may constrain the Agency from authorizing or carrying out projects and activities, or the manner in which they may occur. Projects and activities must be consistent with the plan (§ 219.15). A plan does not regulate uses by the public, but a project or activity decision that regulates a use by the public under 36 CFR Part 261, Subpart B, may be made contemporaneously with the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. Plans should not repeat laws, regulations, or program management policies, practices, and procedures that are in the Forest Service Directive System.\n\n(3) The supervisor of the national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit is the responsible official for development and approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for lands under the responsibility of the supervisor, unless a regional forester; the Chief; the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment; or the Secretary acts as the responsible official. Two or more responsible officials may undertake joint planning over lands under their respective jurisdictions.\n\n(4) A plan for a unit that contains an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director with respect to the direction applicable to that area, and a plan amendment applicable to an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director.\n\n(5) The Chief is responsible for leadership and direction for carrying out the NFS land management planning program under this part. The Chief shall:\n\n(i) Establish planning procedures for this part in the Forest Service Directive System in Forest Service Manual 1920—Land Management Planning and in Forest Service Handbook 1909.12—Land Management Planning Handbook.\n\n(ii) Establish and administer a national oversight process for accountability and consistency of NFS land management planning under this part.\n\n(iii) Establish procedures in the Forest Service Directive System for obtaining inventory data on the various renewable resources, and soil and water.\n\n(c) Project and activity planning. The supervisor or district ranger is the responsible official for project and activity decisions, unless a higher-level official acts as the responsible official. Requirements for project or activity planning are established in the Forest Service Directive System. Except as provided in the plan consistency requirements in § 219.15, none of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities.",

          "content": "§ 219.5   Planning framework.\n(a) Planning for a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit of the NFS is an iterative process that includes assessment (§ 219.6); developing, amending, or revising a plan (§§ 219.7 and 219.13); and monitoring (§ 219.12). These three phases of the framework are complementary and may overlap. The intent of this framework is to create a responsive planning process that informs integrated resource management and allows the Forest Service to adapt to changing conditions, including climate change, and improve management based on new information and monitoring.\n\n(1) Assessment. Assessments rapidly evaluate existing information about relevant ecological, economic, and social conditions, trends, and sustainability and their relationship to the land management plan within the context of the broader landscape. The responsible official shall consider and evaluate existing and possible future conditions and trends of the plan area, and assess the sustainability of social, economic, and ecological systems within the plan area, in the context of the broader landscape (§ 219.6).\n\n(2) Plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision.\n\n(i) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Assessment, preliminary identification of the need to change the plan based on the assessment, development of a proposed plan, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.\n\n(ii) The process for amending a plan includes: Preliminary identification of the need to change the plan, development of a proposed amendment, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan amendment. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects.\n\n(3) Monitoring. Monitoring is continuous and provides feedback for the planning cycle by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant conditions over time, and measuring management effectiveness (§ 219.12). The monitoring program includes plan-level and broader-scale monitoring. The plan-level monitoring program is informed by the assessment phase; developed during plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision; and implemented after plan decision. The regional forester develops broader-scale monitoring strategies. Biennial monitoring evaluation reports document whether a change to the plan or change to the monitoring program is warranted based on new information, whether a new assessment may be needed, or whether there is no need for change at that time.\n\n(b) Interdisciplinary team(s). The responsible official shall establish an interdisciplinary team or teams to prepare assessments; new plans, plan amendments, and plan revisions; and plan monitoring programs.",

An assessment must be completed for the development of a new plan or for a plan revision. The responsible official shall:\n\n(1) Identify and consider relevant existing information in governmental or non-governmental assessments, plans, monitoring reports, studies, and other sources of relevant information. Such sources of information may include State forest assessments and strategies, the Resources Planning Act assessment, ecoregional assessments, non-governmental reports, State comprehensive outdoor recreation plans, community wildfire protection plans, public transportation plans, State wildlife data and action plans, and relevant Agency or interagency reports, resource plans or assessments. Relevant private information, including relevant land management plans and local knowledge, will be considered if publicly available or voluntarily provided.\n\n(2) Coordinate with or provide opportunities for the regional forester, agency staff from State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other governmental and non-governmental parties, and the public to provide existing information for the assessment.\n\n(3) Document the assessment in a report available to the public. The report should document information needs relevant to the topics of paragraph (b) of this section. Document in the report how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment (§ 219.3). Include the report in the planning record (§ 219.14).\n\n(b) Content of the assessment for plan development or revision. In the assessment for plan development or revision, the responsible official shall identify and evaluate existing information relevant to the plan area for the following:\n\n(1) Terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, and watersheds;\n\n(2) Air, soil, and water resources and quality;\n\n(3) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change;\n\n(4) Baseline assessment of carbon stocks;\n\n(5) Threatened, endangered, proposed and candidate species, and potential species of conservation concern present in the plan area;\n\n(6) Social, cultural, and economic conditions;\n\n(7) Benefits people obtain from the NFS planning area (ecosystem services);\n\n(8) Multiple uses and their contributions to local, regional, and national economies;\n\n(9) Recreation settings, opportunities and access, and scenic character;\n\n(10) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources;\n\n(11) Infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors;\n\n(12) Areas of tribal importance;\n\n(13) Cultural and historic resources and uses;\n\n(14) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns; and\n\n(15) Existing designated areas located in the plan area including wilderness and wild and scenic rivers and potential need and opportunity for additional designated areas.\n\n(c) Plan amendment assessments.

A plan revision creates a new plan for the entire plan area, whether the plan revision differs from the prior plan to a small or large extent. A plan must be revised at least every 15 years. But, the responsible official has the discretion to determine at any time that conditions on a plan area have changed significantly such that a plan must be revised (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)).\n\n(b) New plan development. New plan development is required for new NFS units. The process for developing a new plan is the same as the process for plan revision.\n\n(c) Process for plan development or revision. (1) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Public notification and participation (§§ 219.4 and 219.16), assessment (§§ 219.5 and 219.6), developing a proposed plan, considering the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved (subpart B), and, finally, approving the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.\n\n(2) In developing a proposed new plan or proposed plan revision, the responsible official shall:\n\n(i) Review relevant information from the assessment and monitoring to identify a preliminary need to change the existing plan and to inform the development of plan components and other plan content.\n\n(ii) Consider the goals and objectives of the Forest Service strategic plan (§ 219.2(a)).\n\n(iii) Identify the presence and consider the importance of various physical, biological, social, cultural, and historic resources on the plan area (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.\n\n(iv) Consider conditions, trends, and stressors (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.\n\n(v) Identify and evaluate lands that may be suitable for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and determine whether to recommend any such lands for wilderness designation.\n\n(vi) Identify the eligibility of rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, unless a systematic inventory has been previously completed and documented and there are no changed circumstances that warrant additional review.\n\n(vii) Identify existing designated areas other than the areas identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi) of this section, and determine whether to recommend any additional areas for designation. If the responsible official has the delegated authority to designate a new area or modify an existing area, then the responsible official may designate such area when approving the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.\n\n(viii) Identify the suitability of areas for the appropriate integration of resource management and uses, with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11, including identifying lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).\n\n(ix) Identify the maximum quantity of timber that may be removed from the plan area (§ 219.11(d)(6)).\n\n(x) Identify questions and indicators for the plan monitoring program (§ 219.12).\n\n(xi) Identify potential other content in the plan (paragraph (f) of this section).\n\n(3) The regional forester shall identify the species of conservation concern for the plan area in coordination with the responsible official.\n\n(d) Management areas or geographic areas. Every plan must have management areas or geographic areas or both. The plan may identify designated or recommended designated areas as management areas or geographic areas.\n\n(e) Plan components. Plan components guide future project and activity decisionmaking. The plan must indicate whether specific plan components apply to the entire plan area, to specific management areas or geographic areas, or to other areas as identified in the plan.\n\n(1) Required plan components. Every plan must include the following plan components:\n\n(i) Desired conditions. A desired condition is a description of specific social, economic, and/or ecological characteristics of the plan area, or a portion of the plan area, toward which management of the land and resources should be directed. Desired conditions must be described in terms that are specific enough to allow progress toward their achievement to be determined, but do not include completion dates.\n\n(ii) Objectives. An objective is a concise, measurable, and time-specific statement of a desired rate of progress toward a desired condition or conditions. Objectives should be based on reasonably foreseeable budgets.\n\n(iii) Standards. A standard is a mandatory constraint on project and activity decisionmaking, established to help achieve or maintain the desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.\n\n(iv) Guidelines. A guideline is a constraint on project and activity decisionmaking that allows for departure from its terms, so long as the purpose of the guideline is met. (§ 219.15(d)(3)). Guidelines are established to help achieve or maintain a desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.\n\n(v) Suitability of lands. Specific lands within a plan area will be identified as suitable for various multiple uses or activities based on the desired conditions applicable to those lands. The plan will also identify lands within the plan area as not suitable for uses that are not compatible with desired conditions for those lands. The suitability of lands need not be identified for every use or activity. Suitability identifications may be made after consideration of historic uses and of issues that have arisen in the planning process. Every plan must identify those lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).\n\n(2) Optional plan component: goals. A plan may include goals as plan components. Goals are broad statements of intent, other than desired conditions, usually related to process or interaction with the public. Goals are expressed in broad, general terms, but do not include completion dates.\n\n(3) Requirements for the set of plan components. The set of plan components must meet the requirements set forth in this part for sustainability (§ 219.8), plant and animal diversity (§ 219.9), multiple use (§ 219.10), and timber (§ 219.11).\n\n(f) Other content in the plan. (1) Other required content in the plan. Every plan must:\n\n(i) Identify watershed(s) that are a priority for maintenance or restoration;\n\n(ii) Describe the plan area's distinctive roles and contributions within the broader landscape;\n\n(iii) Include the monitoring program required by § 219.12; and\n\n(iv) Contain information reflecting proposed and possible actions that may occur on the plan area during the life of the plan, including: the planned timber sale program; timber harvesting levels; and the proportion of probable methods of forest vegetation management practices expected to be used (16 U.S.C. 1604(e)(2) and (f)(2)). Such information is not a commitment to take any action and is not a “proposal” as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1508.23, 42 U.S.C. 4322(2)(C)).\n\n(2) Optional content in the plan. A plan may include additional content, such as potential management approaches or strategies and partnership opportunities or coordination activities.\n\n[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012]",

          "content": "§ 219.11   Timber requirements based on the NFMA.\nWhile meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.10, a plan developed or revised under this part must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, and other plan content regarding timber management within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:\n\n(a) Lands not suited for timber production. (1) The responsible official shall identify lands within the plan area as not suited for timber production if any one of the following factors applies:\n\n(i) Statute, Executive order, or regulation prohibits timber production on the land;\n\n(ii) The Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief has withdrawn the land from timber production;\n\n(iii) Timber production would not be compatible with the achievement of desired conditions and objectives established by the plan for those lands;\n\n(iv) The technology is not currently available for conducting timber harvest without causing irreversible damage to soil, slope, or other watershed conditions;\n\n(v) There is no reasonable assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years after final regeneration harvest; or\n\n(vi) The land is not forest land.\n\n(2) The responsible official shall review lands identified in the plan as not suited for timber production at least once every 10 years, or as otherwise prescribed by law, to determine whether conditions have changed so that they have become suitable for timber production. As a result of this 10-year review, the plan may be amended to identify any such lands as suitable for timber production, if warranted by changed conditions.\n\n(b) Timber harvest for purposes of timber production. A plan that identifies lands as suitable for timber production must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to guide timber harvest for timber production or for other multiple use purposes on such lands.\n\n(c) Timber harvest for purposes other than timber production. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the plan may include plan components to allow for timber harvest for purposes other than timber production throughout the plan area, or portions of the plan area, as a tool to assist in achieving or maintaining one or more applicable desired conditions or objectives of the plan in order to protect other multiple-use values, and for salvage, sanitation, or public health or safety. Examples of using timber harvest to protect other multiple use values may include improving wildlife or fish habitat, thinning to reduce fire risk, or restoring meadow or savanna ecosystems where trees have invaded.\n\n(d) Limitations on timber harvest. Whether timber harvest would be for the purposes of timber production or other purposes, plan components, including standards or guidelines, must ensure the following:\n\n(1) No timber harvest for the purposes of timber production may occur on lands not suited for timber production.\n\n(2) Timber harvest would occur only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions would not be irreversibly damaged;\n\n(3) Timber harvest would be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic resources.\n\n(4) Where plan components will allow clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, or other cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand of timber, the plan must include standards limiting the maximum size for openings that may be cut in one harvest operation, according to geographic areas, forest types, or other suitable classifications. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, this limit may not exceed 60 acres for the Douglas-fir forest type of California, Oregon, and Washington; 80 acres for the southern yellow pine types of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas; 100 acres for the hemlock-Sitka spruce forest type of coastal Alaska; and 40 acres for all other forest types.\n\n(i) Plan standards may allow for openings larger than those specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section to be cut in one harvest operation where the responsible official determines that larger harvest openings are necessary to help achieve desired ecological conditions in the plan area. If so, standards for exceptions shall include the particular conditions under which the larger size is permitted and must set a maximum size permitted under those conditions.\n\n(ii) Plan components may allow for size limits exceeding those established in paragraphs (d)(4) introductory text and (d)(4)(i) of this section on an individual timber sale basis after 60 days public notice and review by the regional forester.\n\n(iii) The plan maximum size for openings to be cut in one harvest operation shall not apply to the size of openings harvested as a result of natural catastrophic conditions such as fire, insect and disease attack, or windstorm (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(F)(iv)).\n\n(5) Timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where such harvest would comply with the resource protections set out in sections 6(g)(3)(E) and (F) of the NFMA (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(E) and (F)). Some of these requirements are listed in paragraphs (d)(2) to (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(6) The quantity of timber that may be sold from the national forest is limited to an amount equal to or less than that which can be removed from such forest annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. This limit may be measured on a decadal basis.\n\n(i) The plan may provide for departures from this limit as provided by the NFMA when departure would be consistent with the plan's desired conditions and objectives. Exceptions for departure from this limit on the quantity sold may be made only after a public review and comment period of at least 90 days.\n\n(ii) This limit may be based upon increases in harvest levels based on intensified management practices, such as reforestation, thinning, and tree improvement if such practices justify increasing the harvests in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The plan must require that such harvest levels be decreased at the end of each planning period if such practices cannot be successfully implemented or funds are not received to permit such practices to continue substantially as planned.\n\n(iii) The Chief must include in the Forest Service Directive System procedures for estimating the quantity of timber that can be removed annually in perpetuity on a sustained-yield basis, and exceptions, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1611.\n\n(7) The regeneration harvest of even-aged stands of trees is limited to stands that generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of growth. This requirement would apply only to regeneration harvest of even-aged stands on lands identified as suitable for timber production and where timber production is the primary purpose for the harvest. Plan components may allow for exceptions, set out in 16 U.S.C. 1604(m), only if such harvest is consistent with the other plan components of the land management plan.\n\n[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012; 78 FR 23492, Apr. 19, 2013; 81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016; 86 FR 68149, Dec. 1, 2021]",

          "content": "§ 219.12   Monitoring.\n(a) Plan monitoring program. (1) The responsible official shall develop a monitoring program for the plan area and include it in the plan. Monitoring information should enable the responsible official to determine if a change in plan components or other plan content that guide management of resources on the plan area may be needed. The development of the plan monitoring program must be coordinated with the regional forester and Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development. Responsible officials for two or more administrative units may jointly develop their plan monitoring programs.\n\n(2) The plan monitoring program sets out the plan monitoring questions and associated indicators. Monitoring questions and associated indicators must be designed to inform the management of resources on the plan area, including by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant changes, and measuring management effectiveness and progress toward achieving or maintaining the plan's desired conditions or objectives. Questions and indicators should be based on one or more desired conditions, objectives, or other plan components in the plan, but not every plan component needs to have a corresponding monitoring question.\n\n(3) The plan monitoring program should be coordinated and integrated with relevant broader-scale monitoring strategies (paragraph (b) of this section) to ensure that monitoring is complementary and efficient, and that information is gathered at scales appropriate to the monitoring questions.\n\n(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the responsible official has the discretion to set the scope and scale of the plan monitoring program, after considering:\n\n(i) Information needs identified through the planning process as most critical for informed management of resources on the plan area; and\n\n(ii) The financial and technical capabilities of the Agency.\n\n(5) Each plan monitoring program must contain one or more monitoring questions and associated indicators addressing each of the following:\n\n(i) The status of select watershed conditions.\n\n(ii) The status of select ecological conditions including key characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\n\n(iii) The status of focal species to assess the ecological conditions required under § 219.9.\n\n(iv) The status of a select set of the ecological conditions required under § 219.9 to contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern.\n\n(v) The status of visitor use, visitor satisfaction, and progress toward meeting recreation objectives.\n\n(vi) Measurable changes on the plan area related to climate change and other stressors that may be affecting the plan area.\n\n(vii) Progress toward meeting the desired conditions and objectives in the plan, including for providing multiple use opportunities.\n\n(viii) The effects of each management system to determine that they do not substantially and permanently impair the productivity of the land (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(C)).\n\n(6) A range of monitoring techniques may be used to carry out the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.\n\n(7) This section does not apply to projects or activities. Project and activity monitoring may be used to gather information for the plan monitoring program, and information gathered through plan monitoring may be used to inform development of projects or activities. But, the monitoring requirements of this section are not a prerequisite for making a decision to carry out a project or activity.\n\n(b) Broader-scale monitoring strategies. (1) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy for plan monitoring questions that can best be answered at a geographic scale broader than one plan area.\n\n(2) When developing a monitoring strategy, the regional forester shall coordinate with the relevant responsible officials, Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, partners, and the public. Two or more regional foresters may jointly develop broader-scale monitoring strategies.\n\n(3) Each regional forester shall ensure that the broader-scale monitoring strategy is within the financial and technical capabilities of the region and complements other ongoing monitoring efforts.\n\n(4) Projects and activities may be carried out under plans developed, amended, or revised under this part before the regional forester has developed a broader-scale monitoring strategy.\n\n(c) Timing and process for developing the plan monitoring program and broader-scale strategies. (1) The responsible official shall develop the plan monitoring program as part of the planning process for a new plan development or plan revision. Where a plan's monitoring program has been developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation and the unit has not initiated plan revision under this part, the responsible official shall modify the plan monitoring program within 4 years of the effective date of this part, or as soon as practicable, to meet the requirements of this section.\n\n(2) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy as soon as practicable.\n\n(3) To the extent practicable, appropriate, and relevant to the monitoring questions in the plan monitoring program, plan monitoring programs and broader-scale strategies must be designed to take into account:\n\n(i) Existing national and regional inventory, monitoring, and research programs of the Agency, including from the NFS, State and Private Forestry, and Research and Development, and of other governmental and non-governmental entities;\n\n(ii) Opportunities to design and carry out multi-party monitoring with other Forest Service units, Federal, State or local government agencies, scientists, partners, and members of the public; and\n\n(iii) Opportunities to design and carry out monitoring with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations.\n\n(d) Biennial evaluation of the monitoring information. (1) The responsible official shall conduct a biennial evaluation of new information gathered through the plan monitoring program and relevant information from the broader-scale strategy, and shall issue a written report of the evaluation and make it available to the public.\n\n(i) The first monitoring evaluation for a plan or plan revision developed in accordance with this subpart must be completed no later than 2 years from the effective date of plan decision.\n\n(ii) Where the monitoring program developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation has been modified to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the first monitoring evaluation must be completed no later than 2 years from the date the change takes effect.\n\n(iii) The monitoring evaluation report may be postponed for 1 year in case of exigencies, but notice of the postponement must be provided to the public prior to the date the report is due for that year (§ 219.16(c)(6)).\n\n(2) The monitoring evaluation report must indicate whether or not a change to the plan, management activities, or the monitoring program, or a new assessment, may be warranted based on the new information. The monitoring evaluation report must be used to inform adaptive management of the plan area.\n\n(3) The monitoring evaluation report may be incorporated into other planning documents if the responsible official has initiated a plan revision or relevant amendment.\n\n(4) The monitoring evaluation report is not a decision document representing final Agency action, and is not subject to the objection provisions of subpart B.",

          "content": "§ 219.13   Plan amendment and administrative changes.\n(a) Plan amendment. A plan may be amended at any time. Plan amendments may be broad or narrow, depending on the need for change, and should be used to keep plans current and help units adapt to new information or changing conditions. The responsible official has the discretion to determine whether and how to amend the plan and to determine the scope and scale of any amendment. Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, a plan amendment is required to add, modify, or remove one or more plan components, or to change how or where one or more plan components apply to all or part of the plan area (including management areas or geographic areas).\n\n(b) Amendment requirements. For every plan amendment, the responsible official shall:\n\n(1) Base an amendment on a preliminary identification of the need to change the plan. The preliminary identification of the need to change the plan may be based on a new assessment; a monitoring report; or other documentation of new information, changed conditions, or changed circumstances. When a plan amendment is made together with, and only applies to, a project or activity decision, the analysis prepared for the project or activity may serve as the documentation for the preliminary identification of the need to change the plan.\n\n(2) Provide opportunities for public participation as required in § 219.4 and public notification as required in § 219.16. The responsible official may combine processes and associated public notifications where appropriate, considering the scope and scale of the need to change the plan. The responsible official must include information in the initial notice for the amendment (§ 219.16(a)(1)) about which substantive requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are likely to be directly related to the amendment (§ 219.13(b)(5)).\n\n(3) Amend the plan consistent with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects. Except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity, a proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus requires preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA and therefore requires a 90-day comment period for the proposed plan and draft environmental impact statement (§ 219.16(a)(2)), in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.\n\n(4) Follow the applicable format for plan components set out at § 219.7(e) for the plan direction added or modified by the amendment, except that where an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation would simply modify the area to which existing direction applies, the responsible official may retain the existing formatting for that direction.\n\n(5) Determine which specific substantive requirement(s) within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are directly related to the plan direction being added, modified, or removed by the amendment and apply such requirement(s) within the scope and scale of the amendment. The responsible official is not required to apply any substantive requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 that are not directly related to the amendment.\n\n(i) The responsible official's determination must be based on the purpose for the amendment and the effects (beneficial or adverse) of the amendment, and informed by the best available scientific information, scoping, effects analysis, monitoring data or other rationale.\n\n(ii) When basing the determination on adverse effects:\n\n(A) The responsible official must determine that a specific substantive requirement is directly related to the amendment when scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse effects associated with that requirement, or when the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific resource or use.\n\n(B) If the appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment is a categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment accompanied by a finding of no significant impact (§ 219.13(b)(3)), there is a rebuttable presumption that the amendment will not have substantial adverse effects.\n\n(6) For an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation, if species of conservation concern (SCC) have not been identified for the plan area and if scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse impacts to a specific species, or if the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific species, the responsible official must determine whether such species is a potential SCC, and if so, apply section § 219.9(b) with respect to that species as if it were an SCC.\n\n(c) Administrative changes. An administrative change is any change to a plan that is not a plan amendment or plan revision. Administrative changes include corrections of clerical errors to any part of the plan, conformance of the plan to new statutory or regulatory requirements, or changes to other content in the plan (§ 219.7(f)).\n\n(1) A substantive change to the monitoring program made outside of the process for plan revision or amendment may be made only after notice to the public of the intended change and consideration of public comment (§ 219.16(c)(6)).\n\n(2) All other administrative changes may be made following public notice (§ 219.16(c)(6)).\n\n[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90738, Dec. 15, 2016]",

Every decision document approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must state whether authorizations of occupancy and use made before the decision document may proceed unchanged. If a plan decision document does not expressly allow such occupancy and use, the permit, contract, and other authorizing instrument for the use and occupancy must be made consistent with the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision as soon as practicable, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, subject to valid existing rights.\n\n(b) Application to projects or activities authorized after plan decision. Projects and activities authorized after approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the plan as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(c) Resolving inconsistency. When a proposed project or activity would not be consistent with the applicable plan components, the responsible official shall take one of the following steps, subject to valid existing rights:\n\n(1) Modify the proposed project or activity to make it consistent with the applicable plan components;\n\n(2) Reject the proposal or terminate the project or activity;\n\n(3) Amend the plan so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended; or\n\n(4) Amend the plan contemporaneously with the approval of the project or activity so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended.

          "content": "§ 219.56   Objection time periods and process.\n(a) Time to file an objection. For a new plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, written objections, including any attachments, must be filed within 60 days following the publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52). For an amendment for which an EIS is not prepared, the time to file an objection is within 45 days. It is the responsibility of the objector to ensure that the reviewing officer receives the objection in a timely manner.\n\n(b) Computation of time periods. (1) All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays in the time zone of the reviewing officer. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day (11:59 p.m. for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile machine).\n\n(2) The day after publication of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the first day of the objection filing period.\n\n(3) The publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.\n\n(c) Evidence of timely filing. The objector is responsible for filing the objection in a timely manner. Timeliness must be determined by one of the following indicators:\n\n(1) The date of the U.S. Postal Service postmark for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date;\n\n(2) The electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;\n\n(3) The shipping date for delivery by private carrier for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date; or\n\n(4) The official agency date stamp showing receipt of hand delivery.\n\n(d) Extensions. Time extensions for filing are not permitted except as provided at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(e) Reviewing officer role and responsibilities. The reviewing officer is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Forest Service official having the delegated authority and responsibility to review an objection filed under this subpart. The reviewing officer is a line officer at the next higher administrative level above the responsible official; except that:\n\n(1) For a plan amendment, that next higher-level line officer may delegate the reviewing officer authority and responsibility to a line officer at the same administrative level as the responsible official. Any plan amendment delegation of reviewing officer responsibilities must be made prior to the public notification of an objection filing period (§ 219.52).\n\n(2) For an objection or part of an objection specific to the identification of species of conservation concern, the regional forester who identified the species of conservation concern for the plan area may not be the reviewing officer. The Chief may choose to act as the reviewing officer or may delegate the reviewing officer authority to a line officer at the same administrative level as the regional forester. The reviewing officer for the plan will convey any such objections or parts thereof to the appropriate line officer.\n\n(f) Notice of objections filed. Within 10 days after the close of the objection period, the responsible official shall publish a notice of all objections in the applicable newspaper of record and post the notice online.\n\n(g) Response to objections. The reviewing officer must issue a written response to the objector(s) concerning their objection(s) within 90 days of the end of the objection-filing period. The reviewing officer has the discretion to extend the time when it is determined to be necessary to provide adequate response to objections or to participate in discussions with the parties.

During meetings with objectors and interested persons, the reviewing officer may choose to use alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve objections. All meetings are open to observation by the public.\n\n(b) Response to objections. (1) The reviewing officer must render a written response to the objection(s) within 90 days of the close of the objection-filing period, unless the allowable time is extended as provided at § 219.56(g).

An exception is livestock authorized free of charge under provisions of § 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G). \n\n(b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and resources provided the public through establishment of a system of reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit holder's private ranching operation. \n\n(c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or adult, are equivalent to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule. \n\n(d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service control. \n\n(e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, and at a minimum established for such use. Fees for horses, mules, or burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. \n\n(f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular grazing period. \n\n(g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service. \n\n(h) The excess and unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing a base value without giving consideration for those contributions normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. This rate is charged for unauthorized forage or forage in excess of authorized use and is separate from any penalties that may be assessed for a violation of a prohibition issued under 36 CFR part 261 or from an administrative permit action. This rate will apply to, but not be limited to, the following circumstances: excess number of livestock grazed; livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing season; livestock grazed in areas not authorized under a grazing permit and a bill for collection; or livestock grazed without a permit. Per paragraph (a) of this section, a grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. This includes any excess or unauthorized grazing use. The authorized officer may then waive monetary fees for excess or unauthorized grazing use only when all three of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The excess or unauthorized use was a result of unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances on behalf of the permittee or non-permittee, and the livestock associated with such use were removed by the permittee or non-permittee within the timeframe required by the authorized officer;\n\n(2) The forage consumed by the excess or unauthorized use is not significant; and\n\n(3) National Forest System lands have not been damaged significantly by the excess or unauthorized use. \n\n(i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify. \n\n(j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be March 1 through the following February. \n\n(k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following October and apply to the following fee year. \n\n[44 FR 24843, Apr. 27, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 42450, Aug. 21, 1981; 53 FR 2984, Feb. 2, 1988; 87 FR 35104, June 9, 2022]",

(National Grasslands are excluded, see § 222.52.) \n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 222.50, paragraph (b), the calculated grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years represents the economic value of the use of the land to the user and is the product of multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the result of the annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; provided, that the annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given year shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the previous year's fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be less than $1.35 per head per month.

The grazing fee charged under this section shall be based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal or State leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar to grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the East with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing lease rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs of operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other than grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.\n\n(1) Establishing Base Grazing Value. (i) The Chief of the Forest Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for the following designated subregions:\n\n(A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);\n\n(B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);\n\n(C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont);\n\n(D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia);\n\n(E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and\n\n(F) Florida.\n\n(ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.\n\n(iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates for private grazing lands.\n\n(2) Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value. To maintain currency with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of “other baled hay,” computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.\n\n(3) Computation of Annual Grazing Fee—(i) Annual Fee Basis. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required range improvements.\n\n(ii) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.\n\n(4) Implementation. The grazing fee formula provided by this section shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, beginning in 1990.\n\n[55 FR 2650, Jan. 26, 1990]",

          "content": "§ 222.54   Grazing fees in the East—competitive bidding.\n(a) General Procedures—(1) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on National Forest System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of February 26, 1990 as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for such lands that have already been established under competitive procedures as of the date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive bidding in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do not apply to negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit in accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas.\n\n(2) Allowable Bidders. Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.\n\n(b) Establishment of Minimum Bid Price. Authorized officers shall establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described in § 222.53 of this subpart.\n\n(c) Prospectus. (1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.\n\n(2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall also disclose the following:\n\n(i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing use;\n\n(ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;\n\n(iii) Any required range improvements; and\n\n(iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be eligible for a permit.\n\n(3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all prospective bidders upon request. \n\n(d) Submission of bid. Each applicant shall submit an application for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid. \n\n(e) Qualifications and Deposit Refunds. Upon opening applicants bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified or who does not offer the high bid. \n\n(f) Permit Issuance. The authorized officer shall issue the grazing permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for the occupancy offered and forage sold. \n\n(1) Priority for Reissuance. On allotments where a current permit is expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be awarded to the initial high bidder. \n\n(2) Identical Bids. In cases of identical bids, the selection of the successful applicant shall be made through a drawing. \n\n(g) Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee—(1) Annual Fee Basis. The highest bid received shall establish the base grazing value in the initial year of the grazing permit for each allotment offered. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index for the relevant subregion as described in § 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value of any agency required range improvements. This hay price index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percent change in the cost of alternative livestock feed. \n\n(2) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits. \n\n(h) No Bids Received. If qualified sealed bids are not received, the authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures specified in § 222.53 of this subpart.\n\n[55 FR 2651, Jan. 26, 1990]",

Tribal officials are encouraged to explain their requests to the Regional Forester or designated Forest Officer and, if necessary, describe how the request fits a traditional and cultural purpose. When an Indian tribe requests forest products located on two or more National Forests, authorized tribal officials should notify each of the affected Forest Service District Ranger's Offices of the requests made on other forests.\n\n(e) Agency Line Officers and managers (who have been authorized by name through official Forest Service correspondence) are authorized to provide trees, portions of trees, and forest products under this section subject to the following limitations:\n\n(1) District Rangers and Forest Officers may provide material not exceeding $25,000 in value in any one fiscal year to an Indian tribe;\n\n(2) Forest Supervisors may provide material not exceeding $50,000 in value in any one fiscal year to an Indian tribe;\n\n(3) Regional Foresters may provide material not exceeding $100,000 in value in any one fiscal year to an Indian tribe; and\n\n(4) The Chief of the Forest Service may provide material exceeding $100,000 in value to an Indian tribe.\n\n(f) A request for trees, portions of trees, or forest products under this section may be conditioned or denied for reasons including, but not limited to the following:\n\n(1) Protecting public health and safety;\n\n(2) Preventing interference with Forest Service and/or commercial operations;\n\n(3) Complying with Federal and State laws and regulations;\n\n(4) Ensuring sustainability; or\n\n(5) Otherwise protecting National Forest System land and resources.\n\n(g) All decisions made under this section must comply with the National Forest Management Act, relevant land management plans, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, all other applicable laws and regulations, and are subject to tribal treaty and other reserved rights and the savings provisions of the Cultural and Heritage Cooperation Authority (25 U.S.C. 3057(b)).\n\n\n\n[81 FR 65896, Sept. 26, 2016]",

In determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.\n\n(b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require purchasers to make a downpayment in cash at the time a timber sale contract is executed, except that a downpayment is not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a downpayment is needed to ensure the government's financial security.\n\n(c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, except in those geographic areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines that it is necessary to increase the amount of the downpayment in order to deter speculation. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of recalculating the minimum downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.\n\n(d) A purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until:\n\n(1) On scaled sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale has been charged and paid for, or the estimated value of unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or\n\n(2) On tree measurement sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for, or the estimated value of timber remaining to be cut, removed and paid for as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment. On lump sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release of the single payment unit.\n\n(e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser awarded a Forest Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988, has failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract and is notified by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and\n\n(2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000; and\n\n(3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not been taken to avoid future deficient performance.\n\n(f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and the limitations of paragraph (h) of this section on application of downpayment shall no longer apply.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of the National Forest System. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined in accordance with this paragraph when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of redetermining the downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.\n\n(h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to other uses until:\n\n(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or\n\n(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.\n\n(i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:\n\n(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been scaled of that species.\n\n(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber outstanding (i.e., not shown on the timber sale statement of account as cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current contract rate for each species is that specified in the Forest Service timber sale contract.\n\n(j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service may increase the period for retention of the downpayment and/or preclude temporary reduction of the downpayment under paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section for future contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving the public notice and opportunity to comment.\n\n(k) The Forest Service may temporarily reduce the downpayment when a purchaser's scheduled operations are delayed, interrupted, or extended for 30 or more consecutive days for any of the following reasons:\n\n(1) Forest Service requests or orders purchaser to delay or interrupt operations for reasons other than breach;\n\n(2) A contract term addition pursuant to purchaser shifting operations to a sale designated by the Forest Service as in urgent need of harvesting; or\n\n(3) An extension of the contract term authorized upon a determination of substantial overriding public interest, including a market-related contract term addition, or an urgent removal contract term extension under 36 CFR 223.53.\n\n(l) When purchaser is not cutting or removing timber under contract during a qualifying period of delay, interruption, or extension listed in paragraph (k) of this section, the downpayment may be reduced to $1000 or 2 percent of the downpayment amount stated in the contract, whichever is greater. The purchaser must restore the downpayment to the full amount stated in the contract within 15 days from receipt of the bill for collection and written notice from the contracting officer that the basis for temporarily reducing the downpayment no longer exists. Purchaser shall not cut or remove timber on a contract where the downpayment has been temporarily reduced until the downpayment amount stated in the contract is fully restored.\n\n[74 FR 40743, Aug. 13, 2009]",

Total contract value excludes required deposits and is determined at bid date. \n\n(2) Current contract value is the sum of the products of the current contract rates and, in a scaled sale, estimated remaining unscaled volume or, in a tree measurement sale, the estimated remaining quantities by species of included timber meeting utilization standards. \n\n(3) Normal operating season is the period so specified in a timber sale contract. \n\n(4) Periodic payment(s) is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed. \n\n(5) A periodic payment determination date is a date specified in a timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges (stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment amount required as of that date in the contract. \n\n(b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of account billing date.\n\n(1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion date and the termination date. If there is no road construction requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and the termination date. \n\n(2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic payment whichever date is first. \n\n(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), periodic payments are not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that periodic payments are needed to ensure the Government's financial security.\n\n(c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value. \n\n(d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract value. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value. \n\n(e) Dates for determining future periodic payments shall be adjusted as follows:\n\n(1) When contract term adjustments are granted under § 223.46, \n\n(2) When market-related contract term additions are granted under § 223.52,\n\n(3) When urgent removal extensions are granted under § 223.53, or\n\n(4) When extensions in the substantial overriding public interest are granted under § 223.115(b).

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, each timber sale contract exceeding 1 year in length shall contain a provision for the addition of time to the contract term, under the following conditions:\n\n(i) The Chief of the Forest Service has determined that adverse wood products market conditions have resulted in a drastic reduction in wood product prices applicable to the sale; and\n\n(ii) The purchaser makes a written request for additional time to perform the contract.\n\n(2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor shall determine and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the index to be used for each sale based on the species and product characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume. If none of the indices in paragraph (b) of this section represent more than one-half of the advertised volume, the index specified shall represent the species product combination representing the highest percentage of volume for which there is an index. When the Forest Supervisor determines that the species and potential product characteristics are such that more than one index could be used, the prospectus will state that the Contracting Officer may, upon the purchaser's written request, select an alternative index from paragraph (b) of this section, and may modify the contract by mutual agreement, at time of contract execution, to include an alternative index that the Contracting Officer has determined represents the highest percentage of products the purchaser intends to produce or have produced from the sale. Purchasers seeking a change of index at time of award must substantiate the need for an alternative index by providing the Contracting Officer with a written request that includes a list of products by volume the purchaser intends to produce or expects will be produced from the timber on that sale. In the event a mutual agreement to modify a contract to include an alternative index is not reached at time of contract execution, the index specified in the sample contract shall apply.\n\n(3) A market-related contract term addition provision shall not be included in contracts where the primary management objective requires prompt removal of the timber, such as, timber is subject to rapid deterioration, timber is in a wildland-urban interface area, or hazard trees adjacent to developed sites.\n\n(b) Determination of drastic wood product price reductions. (1) The Forest Service shall monitor and use Producer Price Indices, as prepared by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), adjusted to a constant dollar base, to determine if market-related contract term additions are warranted.\n\n(i) The Forest Service shall monitor and use only the following indices:\n\nBLS producer price index \nIndex\nseries \nIndex code \nHardwood LumberCommodity0812 \nSoftwood LumberCommodity0811 \nWood ChipsIndustry3211135\n(ii) Preliminary index values will be revised when final index values become available, however, determination of a qualifying quarter will not be revised when final index values become available.\n\n(2) For PPI index codes 0811 and 0812, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the applicable adjusted price index is less than 88.5 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the applicable adjusted index is more than 11.5 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous 8 calendar quarters. For PPI index code 3211135, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the adjusted price index is less than 85 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the adjusted index is more than 15 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous eight calendar quarters. Qualifying quarter determinations will be made using the Producer Price Indices for the months of March, June, September, and December.\n\n(3) A determination, made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, shall constitute a finding that the substantial overriding public interest justifies the contract term addition.\n\n(c) Granting market-related contract term additions. When the Chief of the Forest Service determines, pursuant to this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, the Forest Service is to notify affected timber sale purchasers. For any contract which has been awarded and has not been terminated, the Forest Service, upon a purchaser's written request, will add 1 year to the contract's terms, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. This 1-year addition includes time outside of the normal operating season.\n\n(1) Additional contract time may not be granted for those portions of the contract:\n\n(i) With a required completion date;\n\n(ii) Where the Forest Service determines that the timber is in need of urgent removal;\n\n(iii) Where timber deterioration or resource damage may result from delay; or\n\n(iv) Where included timber is designated by diameter and delay may change the treatment as a result of trees growing into or out of the specified diameter range(s).\n\n(2) For each additional consecutive quarter in which a contract qualifies for market-related contract term addition, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except that no single 3-month addition shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.\n\n(3) No more than 3 years shall be added to a contract's term by market-related contract term addition unless the following conditions are met:\n\n(i) The sale was awarded after December 31, 2006;\n\n(ii) A drastic reduction in wood product prices occurred in at least ten of twelve consecutive quarters during the contract term, but not including the quarter in which the contract was awarded; and\n\n(4) For each qualifying quarter meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except no single 3-month addition shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.\n\n(5) In no event shall a revised contract term exceed 10 years as a result of market-related contract term addition.\n\n(d) Recalculation of periodic payments. Where a contract is lengthened as a result of market conditions, any subsequent periodic payment dates shall be delayed 1 month for each month added to the contract's term.\n\n[63 FR 24114, May 1, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 37269, June 29, 2005; 71 FR 3411, Jan. 23, 2006; 73 FR 65551, Nov. 4, 2008]",

          "content": "§ 223.53   Urgent removal contract extensions.\n(a) Finding. There is substantial, overriding public interest in extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged (green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and drought.\n\n(b) Regional Forester determination. If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that: \n\n(1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted; \n\n(2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and \n\n(3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following: \n\n(i) Pose a threat to public safety, \n\n(ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or \n\n(iii) Significant private or other public resource loss. \n\n(c) Purchaser request. To obtain an urgent removal extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes the following: \n\n(1) An explanation of why the harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber within the term of the existing National Forest System contract(s) will prevent or otherwise impede the removal of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal; and \n\n(2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest Service. \n\n(d) Contracting Officer determination. To grant an urgent removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the following: \n\n(1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the catastrophe; \n\n(2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent possible, the health of the National Forest System lands, including: \n\n(i) That urgent removal extension does not adversely affect other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National Forest System timber sale being extended; and \n\n(ii) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject to rapid deterioration. \n\n(3) That the purchaser has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension on the same National Forest System timber sale contract based on the current catastrophic event. Subsequent urgent removal extensions may be granted if there are subsequent Regional Forester determinations on other catastrophic events. \n\n(4) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System contract was awarded; and \n\n(5) That the purchaser is not in breach of the National Forest System contract, and all work items, payments, and deposits are current. \n\n(e) Execution of contract extension. An urgent removal extension of a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to § 223.112, which must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being modified and must include the requirement that purchasers make cash payment to cover the costs of remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary. \n\n(f) Information collection. The information required of a purchaser to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control number 0596-0167.\n\n[67 FR 70169, Nov. 21, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 33, Jan. 2, 2004]",

          "content": "§ 223.85   Noncompetitive sale of timber.\n(a) Forest officers may sell, within their authorization, without further advertisement, at not less than appraised value, any timber previously advertised for competitive bids but not sold because of lack of bids and any timber on uncut areas included in a contract which has been terminated by abandonment, cancellation, contract period expiration, or otherwise if such timber would have been cut under the contract. This authority shall not be utilized if there is evidence of competitive interest in the product.\n\n(b) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), are defined to include the potential harm to natural resources, including fish and wildlife, and related circumstances arising as a result of the award or release of timber sale contracts pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246). Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, for timber sale contracts that have been or will be awarded or released pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246), the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those timber sale contracts by substituting timber from outside the sale area specified in the contract for timber within the timber sale contract area.\n\n(c) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), includes those conditions under which contracts for the sale or exchange of timber or other forest products must be suspended, modified, or terminated under the terms of such contracts to prevent environmental degradation or resource damage, or as the result of administrative appeals, litigation, or court orders. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, when such extraordinary conditions exist on sales not addressed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those contracts by substituting timber or other forest products from outside the contract area specified in the contract for timber or forest products within the area specified in the contract. When such extraordinary conditions exist, the Forest Service and the purchaser shall make good faith efforts to identify replacement timber or forest products of similar volume, quality, value, access, and topography. When replacement timber or forest products agreeable to both parties is identified, the contract will be modified to reflect the changes associated with the substitution, including a rate redetermination. Concurrently, both parties will sign an agreement waiving any future claims for damages associated with the deleted timber or forest products, except those specifically provided for under the contract up to the time of the modification. If the Forest Service and the purchaser cannot reach agreement on satisfactory replacement timber or forest products, or the proper value of such material, either party may opt to end the search. Replacement timber or forest products must come from the same National Forest as the original contract. The term National Forest in this paragraph refers to an administrative unit headed by a single Forest Supervisor. Only timber or forest products for which a decision authorizing its harvest has been made and for which any applicable appeals or objection process has been completed may be considered for replacement pursuant to this paragraph. The value of replacement timber or forest products may not exceed the value of the material it is replacing by more than $10,000, as determined by standard Forest Service appraisal methods.\n\n[61 FR 14621, Apr. 3, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 34826, June 16, 2006; 72 FR 59190, Oct. 19, 2007]",

          "content": "§ 223.118   Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside program share recomputation decisions.\n(a) Decisions subject to appeal. The rules of this section govern appeal of recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or market changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small business share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions related to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and carryover volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a recomputation is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions made both at the earlier stage as well as the later stage are appealable.\n\n(b) Manner of giving notice—(1) Predecisional notice and comment. The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to reallocate shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation decision.\n\n(2) Notice of decision. Upon close of the 30-day predecisional review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of decision must identify the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the address, the date by which an appeal must be filed, and a source for obtaining the appeal procedures information.\n\n(c) Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party. (1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written comments as an interested party.\n\n(2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have individually, or through an association to which they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file comments as an interested party.\n\n(ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).\n\n(3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant withdraws the appeal.\n\n(d) Level of appeal. Only one level of review is available for appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may designate.\n\n(e) Filing procedures. In order to file an appeal under this section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing period.\n\n(f) Content of notice of appeal. (1) It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be reversed or changed.\n\n(2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice of appeal:\n\n(i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone number;\n\n(ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;\n\n(iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:\n\n(iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the decision being appealed;\n\n(v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) raised by the appeal;\n\n(vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that the appellant believes to have been violated and the basis for such an allegation;\n\n(vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, including evidence of submission of written comments at the predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and\n\n(viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.\n\n(g) Time periods and timeliness. (1) All time periods applicable to this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action related to the appeal.\n\n(2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal working day.\n\n(3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely filing. Where postmarks or facsimile imprints are illegible, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.\n\n(4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.\n\n(h) Dismissal without decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The appellant is not on the timber sale bidders list for the area affected by the recomputation decision;\n\n(2) The appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the required time period;\n\n(3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; or\n\n(4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(i) Appeal record. The appeal record consists of the written decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must be sent to the appellant at the same time.\n\n(j) Appeal decision—(1) Responsive statement for appeal decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the appeal is not necessary.\n\n(2) Appeal issue clarification. For clarification of issues raised in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested party may be invited to discuss data relevant to the appeal. Information provided to clarify issues or facts in the appeal must be based upon information previously documented in the file or appeal. Any information provided as a result of the Appeal Deciding Officer's request for more information must be made available to all parties, that is, to the Responsible Official, the appellant, and interested parties who have submitted comments on the appeal. All parties will have 5 days after the Appeal Deciding Officer receives the additional information to review and comment on the information, and the appeal decision period will be extended 5 additional days.\n\n(3) Issuance of final decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal decision to the parties within 30 days of the close of the appeal period except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering an appeal decision.\n\n(k) Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal. Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation are effective on April 1 following the end of the 5-year period being considered. If an appeal that may affect the shares for the next 5-year period is not resolved by the April 1 date, the share decision announced by the Responsible Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision results in a change in the shares, the revised total share of the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the remaining portion of the 5-year period.\n\n(l) Timber sale set-aside policy changes. Timber purchasers shall receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and implementation.\n\n(m) Information collection requirements. The provisions of paragraph (f) of this section specify the information that appellants must provide when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.\n\n[64 FR 411, Jan. 5, 1999]",

Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall conform with the following requirements: \n\n(i) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the debarring official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected to by the Department of Justice.\n\n(ii) At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents.\n\n(iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made available at cost to the respondent upon request, unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.\n\n(5) Debarring official's decision—(i) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgement or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the purchaser or any specifically named affiliate. The decision shall be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted, unless the debarring official extends this period for good cause.\n\n(ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, the debarring official shall promptly prepare written findings of fact. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the purchaser or any specifically named affiliate and any other information in the administrative record.\n\n(B) The debarring official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.\n\n(C) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.\n\n(6) Standard of evidence. In any action in which the proposed debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.

An export yard or pond is an area where sorting and/or bundling of logs for shipment outside the United States is accomplished. Unprocessed timber, whether from National Forest System or private lands, is exported directly when exported by the National Forest timber purchaser. Timber is exported indirectly when export occurs as a result of a sale to another person or as a consequence of any subsequent transaction. \n\n(b) Historic level means the average annual volume of unprocessed timber purchased or exported in calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973.\n\n(c) Private lands mean lands held or owned by a private person. Nonprivate lands include, but are not limited to, lands held or owned by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or any other public agency, or lands held in trust by the United States for Indians.\n\n(d) Substitution means the purchase of unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands to be used as replacement for unprocessed timber from private lands which is exported by the purchaser. Substitution occurs when (1) a person increases purchases of National Forest timber in any Calendar year more than 10 percent above their historic level and in the same calendar year exports unprocessed timber from private land in the tributary area; or (2) a person increases exports of unprocessed timber from private land in any tributary area more than 10 percent above their historic level in any calendar year while they have National Forest timber under contract.\n\n(e) Tributary area means the geographic area from which unprocessed timber is delivered to a specific processing facility or complex. A tributary area is expanded when timber outside an established tributary area is hauled to the processing facility or complex.\n\n(f) Unprocessed timber, except western red cedar in the contiguous 48 States, means trees or portions of trees having a net scale content not less than 33\n1/3 percent of the gross volume, or the minimum piece specification set forth in the timber sale contract, in material meeting the peeler and sawmill log grade requirements published in the January 1, 1980—Official Log Scaling and Grading Rules used by Log Scaling and Grading Bureaus on the West Coast; cants to be subsequently remanufactured exceeding 8\n3/4 inches in thickness; cants of any thickness reassembled into logs; and split or round bolts, except for aspen, or other roundwood not processed to standards and specifications suitable for end-product use. Unprocessed timber shall not mean pulp (utility) grade logs and Douglas-fir special cull logs or timber processed into the following:\n\n(1) Lumber and construction timbers, regardless of size, sawn on four sides; \n\n(2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;\n\n(3) Green veneer and plywood;\n\n(4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated for use as such;\n\n(5) Cants cut for remanufacture, 8\n3/4 inches in thickness or less;\n\n(6) Aspen bolts, not exceeding 4 feet in length.\n\n(g) Unprocessed western red cedar timber in the contiguous 48 States means trees or portions of trees of that species which have not been processed into—\n\n(1) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of Number 3 Common or better; \n\n(2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products; \n\n(3) Veneer and plywood; \n\n(4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated with preservatives for use as such and not intended to be further processed; or \n\n(5) Shakes and shingles; provided that lumber from private lands manufactured to the standards established in the lumber grading rules of the American Lumber Standards Association or the Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau and manufactured lumber authorized to be exported under license by the Department of Commerce shall be considered processed.\n\n(h) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity and includes any subsidiary, subcontractor, parent company, or other affiliate. Business entities are considered affiliates for the entire calendar year when one controls or has the power to control the other or when both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person during any part of the calendar year.\n\n(i) Purchase occurs when a person is awarded a contract to cut National Forest timber or through the approval of a third party agreement by the Forest Service.\n\n(j) Purchaser means a person that has purchased a National Forest timber sale.\n\n(Sec. 14, Pub.

To obtain a waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber described in paragraph (f) of this section, a person must have submitted a request for waiver, in writing, to the Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility being sourced is located, which must have been received by the Regional Forester on or before November 20, 1990, and which must have been signed by the person making such request or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer. The request for waiver must be notarized and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal affixed. The request shall be on company letterhead with its corporate seal affixed and must include:\n\n(1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the waiver request, for a period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.\n\n(2) A signed certification statement which reads as follows:\n\n\n“I have engaged in exporting of unprocessed timber originating from private land located within the sourcing area for which I am applying. I desire to purchase directly from a department or agency of the United States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located within the desired sourcing area. I hereby request waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber required by the forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all exporting of such unprocessed private timber from within the desired sourcing area by February 20, 1991, and will not resume such exporting for a period of not less than three (3) years. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”",

          "content": "§ 223.190   Sourcing area application procedures.\n(a) Subject to the restrictions described in § 223.189 of this subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a sourcing area in accordance with the procedures of this section. However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions in § 223.191(e).\n\n(b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period, pursuant to § 223.189 of this subpart, must have applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.\n\n(c) Applications. Sourcing area applications shall include:\n\n(1) A map of sufficient scale and detail to clearly show:\n\n(i) The applicant's desired sourcing area boundary. This boundary will include both the private and Federal lands from which the applicant intends to acquire unprocessed timber for sourcing its manufacturing facilities;\n\n(ii) The location of the timber manufacturing facilities owned or operated by the applicant within the proposed sourcing area where the person intends to process timber originating from Federal land;\n\n(iii) The location of private lands within and outside the desired sourcing area where the person has, within the 24 months immediately preceding the date of the application, acquired unprocessed timber originating from private land which was exported, sold, traded, exchanged, or otherwise conveyed to another person for the purpose of exporting such timber;\n\n(2) A list of other persons with timber manufacturing facilities located within the same general vicinity as the applicant's facilities;\n\n(3) Any other information the applicant may believe is appropriate to support approval of the requested sourcing area; and\n\n(4) A statement signed by the person certifying under the penalties provided in Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information provided in support of the application is true, complete, and accurate to the best of the applicant's knowledge. The statement shall read as follows:\n\n\n“I certify under penalties of 16 U.S.C. 620d and 18 U.S.C. 1001, that the information provided in support of this application, is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns. I certify that the information provided concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns fully and accurately reflects, to the best of my knowledge, the boundaries of the sourcing area for which I am applying. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I certify that I have not exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the boundaries of the sourcing area that is the subject of this application in the previous 24 months. I fully understand that, if this application is approved, exporting unprocessed private timber originating from within the approved sourcing area will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) its implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”\n(d) Confidential information. Applications are not considered confidential. However, if a person does submit confidential information as part of an application, the information should be marked confidential. Information so marked will be afforded the rights and protection provided under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n(e) Where to submit the application. A sourcing area applicant shall send the application to the Office of Administrative Law Judges and shall, simultaneously, send a copy of the sourcing area application to the Forest Service Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility being sourced is located. Where the sourcing area application will cover purchases from more than one agency, application is to be made to the agency from which the applicant expects to purchase the preponderance of its Federal timber. The sourcing area applicant must also send a complete copy of the application to each agency concerned. The lead agency shall make the decision in consultation with, and upon co-signature of, the other agencies concerned.\n\n(f) Signatory procedures. Sourcing area applications must be signed by the person making the request, or in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer, and must be notarized. The application shall be on company letterhead.\n\n(g) The sourcing area application and review process will be conducted pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.\n\n(h) A final decision on a sourcing area application or a formal sourcing area review will be issued within four (4) months of the receipt of the application or initiation of the review.\n\n(i) The following criteria must be met for sourcing area approval:\n\n(1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative similarity of such purchasing patterns.\n\n(2) The “same local vicinity” will normally be manufacturing facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing patterns.\n\n(3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.\n\n(4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, and not characterized by random lines.\n\n(j) Comments. Persons may submit comments on sourcing area applications pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. Persons submitting a comment must certify at the end of the comment, but before the signature, to the following: “I certify that the information provided by me is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and I understand that failure to provide true and accurate information could be violation of the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).”\n\n(k) Transporting or causing to be transported unprocessed private timber from outside of a sourcing area into a sourcing area by the holder of the sourcing area is prohibited as a violation of the sourcing area boundary. Such violation will cause a review of the sourcing area, and could subject the sourcing area holder to the penalties and remedies for violations of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq., and its implementing regulations.\n\n(l) A person with an approved sourcing area may relinquish the sourcing area at any time provided the person certifies to the following:\n\n\n“I am relinquishing the approved sourcing area, described in the Secretary's determination in FSAA ____ on ____, 19__. I understand that I may not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during the fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in my possession or under contract, pursuant to the prohibition against substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (“Act”) and its implementing regulations. I also understand that I may not purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States, pursuant to the prohibitions against substitution in the Act and its implementing regulations. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the Act and its implementing regulations and do fully understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during a fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in possession or under contract, or purchasing unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is a violation of the substitution provisions of the Act and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”\nThe certificate must be signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer; must be on company letterhead; and must be notarized.\n\n(m) A sourcing area is in effect until it is relinquished by the sourcing area holder, or is disapproved upon review of the sourcing area.",

If there is disagreement among the persons who submitted written comments regarding the proper sourcing area, the reviewing official shall convene an informal meeting convenient to the persons that all interested persons may attend. If an agreement cannot be reached among the persons, formal administrative adjudication shall occur. The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing, approve or disapprove the sourcing area being reviewed, pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.\n\n(2) Disapproved sourcing areas shall be reviewed using the process described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon resubmission of an application, provided the applicant has accepted the area the Secretary would have approved as a sourcing area pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(3) The Department reserves the right to schedule a review, at the request of the Forest Service or the person holding the sourcing area, at any time prior to the scheduled tentative review date, with 60 days notice.\n\n(4) Sourcing areas being reviewed shall continue in full force and effect pending the final review determination.\n\n(f) Reporting and record keeping procedures.

The use of highway yellow paint on unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.\n\n(b) Preserving identification. All identifying marks placed on an unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.\n\n(1) A generic log hammer brand, known as a “catch brand”, used to identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or otherwise missing brands where such use is authorized by the Regional Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.\n\n(2) The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow paint.\n\n(c) National Forest System logs.

The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest Supervisor.\n\n(d) Private logs. All unprocessed logs originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that require domestic manufacturing pursuant to § 223.194 of this subpart, shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from the harvest area.

This section provides for the use of contracts and agreements to achieve land management goals for the national forests and the public lands that meet local and rural community needs. In the fulfillment of these activities, the Forest Service may apply the value of timber or other forest products removed from the project site as an offset against the cost of services received under such contracts or agreements.\n\n(b)(1) Procurement of service contracts. If the Forest Service makes a determination as provided under section 223.301(b)(1) of this subpart that a stewardship contract is a contract for the procurement of services, the Forest Service will utilize the contracting procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations including the regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture set forth in Chapter 4 of Title 48 as well as requirements included in § 223.303.\n\n(2) Sale of property contracts. If the Forest Service makes a determination under § 223.301(b)(2) of this subpart that a stewardship contract is to be a contract for the sale of property, the regulations set forth in subparts A and B of this part are generally applicable, except as provided in § 223.304.\n\n(3) Agreements. Agreements entered into under this subpart are not subject to grant regulations found in 2 CFR part 200 as adopted and supplemented by the USDA in 2 CFR parts 400, 416, and 422.\n\n(4) Other provisions. Additional terms and conditions for contracts and agreements may be added to a contract or agreement entered into under this subpart, in accordance with applicable law and to the extent determined to be necessary by the Forest Service.\n\n(c) Parties to contracts and agreements.

Such notice of intent to operate shall be submitted to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations, and the method of transport.\n\n(1) A notice of intent to operate is not required for:\n\n(i) Operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest System purposes;\n\n(ii) Prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study which generally might include searching for and occasionally removing small mineral samples or specimens, gold panning, metal detecting, non-motorized hand sluicing, using battery operated dry washers, and collecting of mineral specimens using hand tools;\n\n(iii) Marking and monumenting a mining claim;\n\n(iv) Underground operations which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance;\n\n(v) Operations, which in their totality, will not cause surface resource disturbance which is substantially different than that caused by other users of the National Forest System who are not required to obtain a Forest Service special use authorization, contract, or other written authorization;\n\n(vi) Operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise might cause a significant disturbance of surface resources; or\n\n(vii) Operations for which a proposed plan of operations is submitted for approval;\n\n(2) The District Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt of a notice of intent to operate, notify the operator if approval of a plan of operations is required before the operations may begin.\n\n(3) An operator shall submit a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations will be conducted in lieu of a notice of intent to operate if the proposed operations will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources. An operator also shall submit a proposed plan of operations, or a proposed supplemental plan of operations consistent with § 228.4(d), to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations are being conducted if those operations are causing a significant disturbance of surface resources but are not covered by a current approved plan of operations. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply to the operations listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement to submit a plan of operations also shall not apply to operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources.\n\n(4) If the District Ranger determines that any operation is causing or will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources, the District Ranger shall notify the operator that the operator must submit a proposed plan of operations for approval and that the operations can not be conducted until a plan of operations is approved.\n\n(b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations under § 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted: Provided, however, That upon a showing of good cause the authorized officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in § 228.4(a) or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part. \n\n(c) The plan of operations shall include: \n\n(1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or designees. \n\n(2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as set forth in § 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed. \n\n(3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation used or to be used as set forth in § 228.12, the period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in § 228.8. \n\n(d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for the full estimated period of activity: Provided, however, That if the development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface disturbance not covered by the initial plan. \n\n(e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer shall determine: \n\n(1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations prior to approving the operating plan, \n\n(2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in § 228.8 and \n\n(3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. \n\n(f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be required. \n\n(g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been assigned Office of Management and Budget Control #0596-0022. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no surface disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy capital investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average of 2 hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

This subpart applies to all National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain of the United States, including public domain lands being administered under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010); to all National Forest System lands acquired pursuant to the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961); to all National Forest System lands with Weeks Act status as provided in the Act of September 2, 1958 (16 U.S.C. 521a); and to public lands within the Copper River addition to the Chugach National Forest (16 U.S.C. 539a). For ease of reference and convenience to the reader, these lands are referred to, throughout this subpart, as National Forest lands.\n\n(b) Restrictions. Disposal of mineral materials from the following National Forest lands is subject to certain restrictions as described below:\n\n(1) Segregation or withdrawals in aid of other agencies. Disposal of mineral materials from lands segregated or withdrawn in aid of a function of another Federal agency, State, territory, county, municipality, water district, or other governmental subdivision or agency may be made only with the written consent of the governmental entity.\n\n(2) Segregated or withdrawn National Forest lands. Mineral materials may not be removed from segregated or withdrawn lands where removal is specifically prohibited by statute or by public land order. Where not specifically prohibited, removal of mineral materials may be allowed if the authorized officer determines that the removal is not detrimental to the values for which the segregation or withdrawal was made, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where operations have been established prior to the effective date of this Subpart and where not prohibited by statute, they may be permitted to continue. Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to prohibit the exercise of valid existing rights.\n\n(3) Unpatented mining claims. Provided that claimants are given prior notice and it has been determined that removal will neither endanger nor materially interfere with prospecting, mining, or processing operations or uses reasonably incident thereto on the claims, disposal of mineral materials may be allowed from:\n\n(i) Unpatented mining claims located after July 23, 1955; and/or\n\n(ii) Unpatented mining claims located before July 23, 1955, and on which the United States has established the right to manage the vegetative and other surface resources in accordance with the Multiple Use Mining Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601, 603, 611-615).\n\n(4) Acquired Bankhead-Jones lands. Mineral materials on lands which were acquired under the authority of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012), and which lie outside the exterior boundaries of National Forests, or on acquired lands which are being administered under the Act and which also lie outside the exterior boundaries of National Forests, may be disposed of under these regulations only to public authorities and agencies, and only on condition that the mineral materials are used for public purposes (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)). \n\n(c) Mineral materials to which this subpart applies. This subpart applies to mineral materials which consist of petrified wood and common varieties of sand, gravel, stone, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay, and other similar materials. Such mineral materials include deposits which, although they have economic value, are used for agriculture, animal husbandry, building, abrasion, construction, landscaping, and similar uses. This subpart also applies to other materials which may not be minerals but are produced using mining methods, such as peat. The categories of these materials, including representative examples, are:\n\n(1) Agricultural supply and animal husbandry materials. This category includes, but is not limited to, minerals and vegetative materials used as or for: Soil conditioners or amendments applied to physically alter soil properties such as direct applications to the soil of carbonate rocks, soil containing “trace elements” and peat; animal feed supplements; and other animal care products.\n\n(2) Building materials. Except for minerals identified as Uncommon Varieties, this category includes, but is not limited to, minerals used as or for: Paint fillers or extenders; flagstone, ashlar, rubble, mortar, brick, tile, pipe, pottery, earthenware, stoneware, terrazzo, and other nonstructural components in floors, walls, roofs, fireplaces, and the like; and similar building uses. \n\n(3) Abrasive materials.

The authorized officer may not offer a competitive sale unless there is a right-of-way or other access to the sale area which is available to anyone qualified to bid.\n\n(b) Advertising—(1) Sales over 25,000 cubic yards. Mineral material sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized officer.\n\n(2) Content of advertising. The advertisement of sale must specify the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, available access, maintenance required over haul routes, traffic controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized officer deems necessary.\n\n(3) Advertising smaller sales. Advertisement of mineral materials amounting to 25,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) or less must be published and/or posted. The methods of advertisement are at the discretion of the authorized officer.\n\n(c) Conduct of sales. (1) Bidding at competitive sales may be conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding results to all bidders within 10 days.\n\n(2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence of qualification at the time of award or, if such evidence has already been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the record containing it.\n\n(3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the authorized officer may reject any or all bids.\n\n(d) Bid deposits and award of contract. Sealed bids must be accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.\n\n(1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value but not less than $100.00. \n\n(2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (§ 228.51(b)). \n\n(3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a competitive sale is impracticable. \n\n(4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United States. \n\n(5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the advertising period.",

The operator shall submit a proposed surface use plan of operations as part of an Application for a Permit to Drill to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the proposed plan of operations is submitted.\n\n(b) Preparation of plan. In preparing a surface use plan of operations, the operator is encouraged to contact the local Forest Service office to make use of such information as is available from the Forest Service concerning surface resources and uses, environmental considerations, and local reclamation procedures.\n\n(c) Content of plan. The type, size, and intensity of the proposed operations and the sensitivity of the surface resources that will be affected by the proposed operations determine the level of detail and the amount of information which the operator includes in a proposed plan of operations. However, any surface use plan of operations submitted by an operator shall contain the information specified by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the surface use plan of operations is submitted.\n\n(d) Supplemental plan. An operator must obtain an approved supplemental surface use plan of operations before conducting any surface disturbing operations that are not authorized by a current approved surface use plan of operations. The operator shall submit a proposed supplemental surface use plan of operations to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the proposed supplemental plan of operations is submitted. The supplemental plan of operations need only address those operations that differ from the operations authorized by the current approved surface use plan of operations. A supplemental plan is otherwise subject to the same requirements under this subpart as an initial surface use plan of operations.",

The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture hereby establish a Federal Subsistence Board (Board) and delegate to it the authority for administering the subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands and the related promulgation and signature authority for regulations of subparts C and D of this part. The Secretaries retain their existing authority to restrict or eliminate hunting, fishing, or trapping activities that occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands when such activities interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority. The Secretaries also retain the ultimate responsibility for compliance with title VIII of ANILCA and other applicable laws and maintain oversight of the Board.\n\n(b) Membership. (1) The voting members of the Board are: A Chair who possesses personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; five public members who possess personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska, three of whom shall be nominated or recommended by federally recognized Tribal governments in Alaska and shall possess personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska (including Alaska Native subsistence uses), to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, National Park Service; the Alaska Regional Forester, U.S. Forest Service; the Alaska State Director, Bureau of Land Management; and the Alaska Regional Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs. Each Federal agency member of the Board may appoint a designee.\n\n(2) Public Board members serve at the will of the Secretaries. The Secretaries maintain their authorities for replacement of Federal agency members, public Board members, or any designees.\n\n(c) Liaisons to the Board are: a State liaison, and the Chairman of each Regional Council. The State liaison and the Chairman of each Regional Council may attend public sessions of all Board meetings and be actively involved as consultants to the Board. \n\n(d) Powers and duties. (1) The Board shall meet at least twice per year and at such other times as deemed necessary. Meetings shall occur at the call of the Chair, but any member may request a meeting. \n\n(2) A quorum consists of five members when the total number of Board members is nine or fewer and six members when the total number of Board members is 10 or higher.\n\n(3) No action may be taken unless a majority of voting members are in agreement. \n\n(4) The Board is empowered, to the extent necessary, to implement Title VIII of ANILCA, to: \n\n(i) Issue regulations for the management of subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands; \n\n(ii) Determine which communities or areas of the State are rural or non-rural; \n\n(iii) Determine which rural Alaska areas or communities have customary and traditional subsistence uses of specific fish and wildlife populations; \n\n(iv) Allocate subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations on public lands; \n\n(v) Ensure that the taking on public lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of fish and wildlife for other purposes; \n\n(vi) Restrict the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands for nonsubsistence uses or close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses when necessary for the conservation of healthy populations of fish or wildlife, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for reasons of public safety or administration. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted;\n\n(vii) Restrict the taking of a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses, close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or otherwise modify the requirements for take from a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses when necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or administration. As soon as conditions warrant, the Board may also reopen public lands to the taking of a fish and wildlife population for subsistence users to continue those uses;\n\n(viii) Establish priorities for the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands among rural Alaska residents; \n\n(ix) Restrict or eliminate taking of fish and wildlife on public lands; \n\n(x) Determine what types and forms of trade of fish and wildlife taken for subsistence uses constitute allowable customary trade; \n\n(xi) Authorize the Regional Councils to convene; \n\n(xii) Establish a Regional Council in each subsistence resource region and recommend to the Secretaries, appointees to the Regional Councils, pursuant to the FACA; \n\n(xiii) Establish Federal Advisory Committees within the subsistence resource regions, if necessary, and recommend to the Secretaries that members of the Federal Advisory Committees be appointed from the group of individuals nominated by rural Alaska residents; \n\n(xiv) Establish rules and procedures for the operation of the Board, and the Regional Councils; \n\n(xv) Review and respond to proposals for regulations, management plans, policies, and other matters related to subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife; \n\n(xvi) Enter into cooperative agreements or otherwise cooperate with Federal agencies, the State, Native organizations, local governmental entities, and other persons and organizations, including international entities to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Federal subsistence management program; \n\n(xvii) Develop alternative permitting processes relating to the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife to ensure continued opportunities for subsistence; \n\n(xviii) Evaluate whether hunting, fishing, or trapping activities which occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority, and after appropriate consultation with the State of Alaska, the Regional Councils, and other Federal agencies, make a recommendation to the Secretaries for their action; \n\n(xix) Identify, in appropriate specific instances, whether there exists additional Federal reservations, Federal reserved water rights or other Federal interests in lands or waters, including those in which the United States holds less than a fee ownership, to which the Federal subsistence priority attaches, and make appropriate recommendation to the Secretaries for inclusion of those interests within the Federal Subsistence Management Program; and \n\n(xx) Take other actions authorized by the Secretaries to implement Title VIII of ANILCA. \n\n(5) The Board may implement one or more of the following harvest and harvest reporting or permit systems: \n\n(i) The fish and wildlife is taken by an individual who is required to obtain and possess pertinent State harvest permits, tickets, or tags, or Federal permit (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit); \n\n(ii) A qualified subsistence user may designate another qualified subsistence user (by using the Federal Designated Harvester Permit) to take fish and wildlife on his or her behalf; \n\n(iii) The fish and wildlife is taken by individuals or community representatives permitted (via a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit) a one-time or annual harvest for special purposes including ceremonies and potlatches; or \n\n(iv) The fish and wildlife is taken by representatives of a community permitted to do so in a manner consistent with the community's customary and traditional practices. \n\n(6) The Board may delegate to agency field officials the authority to set harvest and possession limits, define harvest areas, specify methods or means of harvest, specify permit requirements, and open or close specific fish or wildlife harvest seasons within frameworks established by the Board. \n\n(7) The Board shall establish a Staff Committee for analytical and administrative assistance composed of members from the Office of Subsistence Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and USDA Forest Service. A representative from the Office of Subsistence Management shall serve as Chair of the Interagency Staff Committee.\n\n\n\n(8) The Board may establish and dissolve additional committees as necessary for assistance. \n\n(9) The Office of Subsistence Management and the Interagency Staff Committee shall provide appropriate administrative support for the Board.\n\n(10) The Board shall authorize at least two meetings per year for each Regional Council. \n\n(11) The Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to a unit of the National Forest System, retains authority to (at any time) stay, modify, or disapprove any action taken by the Board.\n\n(12) Special actions of the Board are not effective unless ratified by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to a unit of the National Forest System. To allow an opportunity for the Secretaries to modify, disapprove, stay, or expressly ratify any emergency or temporary special action taken by the Board, such Board actions generally will not become effective until 10 calendar days after the date of the action (or any longer period specified by the Board when taking the action), unless the Board determines that the situation calls for responsive action within a shorter period of time. If no action is taken by the Secretary to modify, disapprove, stay, or expressly ratify within 10 days (or the longer or shorter period specified by the Board), the emergency or temporary special action will be deemed automatically ratified for purposes of this subpart. The Secretaries may revisit a prior ratification (express or automatic) of a Board action at any time. For other Board actions (i.e., actions that follow the regular adoption process in § 242.18), the Secretaries retain, and will exercise when appropriate, their authority to modify or disapprove actions prior to publication in the Federal Register, as is the current practice.\n\n(13) For Board actions such as cyclic regulation revisions, customary and traditional use determinations, subsistence resource regions, rural determinations, and requests for reconsideration, when the Secretaries deem appropriate, they will exercise their authority to modify or disapprove the actions prior to publication of the actions in the Federal Register. The Board's special actions, both emergency and temporary, are often based on time-sensitive harvest opportunities for rural Alaskans or critical conservation concerns for a species and are valid upon decision by the Board. However, the Secretaries may at any time rescind, modify, disapprove, or stay a special action by the Board.\n\n(14) The Secretaries may establish term limits for service of Board members in such circumstances as the Secretaries deem appropriate.\n\n(e) Relationship to Regional Councils. (1) The Board shall consider the reports and recommendations of the Regional Councils concerning the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands within their respective regions for subsistence uses. The Board may choose not to follow any Regional Council recommendation which it determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs, or in closure situations, for reasons of public safety or administration or to assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife population. If a recommendation is not adopted, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for the decision, in writing, in a timely fashion. \n\n(2) The Board shall provide available and appropriate technical assistance to the Regional Councils.\n\n[67 FR 30563, May 7, 2002, as amended at 75 FR 63092, Oct. 14, 2010; 76 FR 56114, Sept. 12, 2011; 89 FR 83628, Oct. 17, 2024; 89 FR 89494, Nov. 13, 2024; 90 FR 34147, July 18, 2025]",

In an emergency situation, if necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for public safety reasons, the Board may immediately open or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for take for subsistence uses, or close public lands to take for nonsubsistence uses of fish and wildlife, or restrict the requirements for take for nonsubsistence uses.\n\n(1) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board may seek Council recommendations on the proposed emergency special action. Such a Council recommendation, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).\n\n(2) The emergency action will be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless the procedures for adoption of a temporary special action, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, have been followed.\n\n(b) Temporary special actions. After adequate notice and public hearing, the Board may temporarily close or open public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for subsistence take, or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses, or restrict take for nonsubsistence uses.\n\n(1) The Board may make such temporary changes only after it determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted.\n\n(i) Prior to implementing a temporary special action, the Board will consult with the State of Alaska and the Chairs of the Regional Councils of the affected regions.\n\n(ii) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board will seek Council recommendations on the proposed temporary special action. Such Council recommendations, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).\n\n(2) The length of any temporary action will be confined to the minimum time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be necessary under the circumstances. In any event, a temporary opening or closure will not extend longer than the end of the current regulatory cycle.\n\n(c) The Board may reject a request for either an emergency or a temporary special action if the Board concludes that there are no time-sensitive circumstances necessitating a regulatory change before the next regular proposal cycle. However, a special action request that has been rejected for this reason may be deferred, if appropriate and after consultation with the proponent, for consideration during the next regular proposal cycle. The Board will consider changes to customary and traditional use determinations in subpart C of this part only during the regular proposal cycle.\n\n(d) The Board will provide notice of all regulatory changes adopted via special action by posting the change on the Office of Subsistence Management website (https://www.doi.gov/subsistence) When appropriate, notice may also include distribution of press releases to newspapers, local radio stations, and local contacts, as well as direct notification to the proponent and interested parties. The Board will publish notice and reasons justifying the special action in the Federal Register as soon as practicable.\n\n(e) The decision of the Board on any proposed special action will constitute its final administrative action.\n\n(f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to implement closures or restrictions on public lands managed by the agency remain unaffected by the regulations in this part.\n\n(g) Fish and wildlife may not be taken in violation of any restriction, closure, or change authorized by the Board.\n\n[75 FR 63092, Oct. 14, 2010, as amended at 90 FR 34147, July 18, 2025]",

Wildlife taken in defense of life or property is not a subsistence use; wildlife so taken is subject to State regulations.\n\n(d) Trapping furbearing animals. The following methods and means of trapping furbearers for subsistence uses pursuant to the requirements of a trapping license are prohibited, in addition to the prohibitions listed at paragraph (b) of this section:\n\n(1) Disturbing or destroying a den, except that you may disturb a muskrat pushup or feeding house in the course of trapping;\n\n(2) Disturbing or destroying any beaver house;\n\n(3) Taking beaver by any means other than a steel trap or snare, except that you may use firearms in certain Units with established seasons as identified in Unit-specific regulations found in this subpart;\n\n(4) Taking otter with a steel trap having a jaw spread of less than 5\n7/8 inches during any closed mink and marten season in the same Unit;\n\n(5) Using a net or fish trap (except a blackfish or fyke trap); and\n\n(6) Taking or assisting in the taking of furbearers by firearm before 3:00 a.m. on the day following the day on which airborne travel occurred; however, this does not apply to a trapper using a firearm to dispatch furbearers caught in a trap or snare.\n\n(e) Possession and transportation of wildlife. Except as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or as otherwise provided, you may not take a species of wildlife in any Unit, or portion of a Unit, if your total take of that species already obtained anywhere in the State under Federal and State regulations equals or exceeds the harvest limit in that Unit.\n\n(f) Harvest limits. (1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping season for a species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for the same species are separate and distinct. This means that if you have taken a harvest limit for a particular species under a trapping season, you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a hunting season or vice versa.\n\n(2) A brown/grizzly bear taken in a Unit or portion of a Unit having a harvest limit of “one brown/grizzly bear per year” counts against a “one brown/grizzly bear every four regulatory years” harvest limit in other Units. You may not take more than one brown/grizzly bear in a regulatory year.\n\n(g) Evidence of sex and identity. (1) If subsistence take of Dall sheep is restricted to a ram, you may not possess or transport a harvested sheep unless both horns accompany the animal.\n\n(2) If the subsistence taking of an ungulate, except sheep, is restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the animal, except that in Units 1-5 antlers are also considered proof of sex for deer if the antlers are naturally attached to an entire carcass, with or without the viscera; and except in Units 11, 13, 19, 21, and 24, where you may possess either sufficient portions of the external sex organs (still attached to a portion of the carcass) or the head (with or without antlers attached; however, the antler stumps must remain attached) to indicate the sex of the harvested moose. However, this paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.\n\n(3) If a moose harvest limit requires an antlered bull, an antler size, or configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph (g)(3) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or consumed.\n\n(h) Removing harvest from the field. (1) You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters and hind quarters of caribou and moose harvested in Units 9, 17, 18, and 19B prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.\n\n(2) You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of moose harvested in Unit 21 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.\n\n(3) You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.

If you take an animal that has been marked or tagged for scientific studies, you must, within a reasonable time, notify the ADF&G or the agency identified on the collar or marker when and where the animal was taken. You also must retain any ear tag, collar, radio, tattoo, or other identification with the hide until it is sealed, if sealing is required; in all cases, you must return any identification equipment to the ADF&G or to an agency identified on such equipment.\n\n(j) Sealing of bear skins and skulls. (1) Sealing requirements for brown bear taken apply in all Units, except as specified in this paragraph (j). Sealing requirements for black bears of all color phases taken apply in Units 1-7, 13-17, and 20.\n\n(2) You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin or skull of a bear unless the skin and skull have been sealed by an authorized representative of ADF&G in accordance with State or Federal regulations, except that the skin and skull of a brown bear taken under a registration permit in Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A, and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, and Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A need not be sealed unless removed from the area.\n\n(3) You must keep a bear skin and skull together until a representative of the ADF&G has removed a rudimentary premolar tooth from the skull and sealed both the skull and the skin; however, this provision does not apply to brown bears taken within Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A, and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, and Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A and which are not removed from the Unit.\n\n(i) In areas where sealing is required by Federal regulations, you may not possess or transport the hide of a bear that does not have the penis sheath or vaginal orifice naturally attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the bear.\n\n(ii) If the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 9B, 17, 18, and 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage is removed from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Bethel, Dillingham, or McGrath; at the time of sealing, the ADF&G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.\n\n(iii) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A from the area or present it for commercial tanning within the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Barrow, Galena, Nome, or Kotzebue; at the time of sealing, the ADF&G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.\n\n(iv) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 5 from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Yakutat.\n\n(v) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 9E from Unit 9, you must first have it sealed by an authorized sealing representative.

You may take wildlife, outside of established season or harvest limits, for food in traditional religious ceremonies, which are part of a funerary or mortuary cycle, including memorial potlatches, under the following provisions:\n\n(1) The harvest does not violate recognized principles of wildlife conservation and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations. The appropriate Federal land manager will establish the number, species, sex, or location of harvest, if necessary, for conservation purposes. Other regulations relating to ceremonial harvest may be found in the Unit-specific regulations in paragraph (n) of this section.\n\n(2) No permit or harvest ticket is required for harvesting under this section; however, the harvester must be a federally qualified subsistence user with customary and traditional use in the area where the harvesting will occur.\n\n(3) In Units 1-26 (except for Koyukon/Gwich'in potlatch ceremonies in Unit 20F, 21, 24, or 25):\n\n(i) A tribal chief, village or tribal council president, or the chief's or president's designee for the village in which the religious/cultural ceremony will be held, or a federally qualified subsistence user outside of a village or tribal-organized ceremony, must notify the nearest Federal land manager that a wildlife harvest will take place.

          "content": "§ 242.27   Subsistence taking of fish.\n(a) Applicability. (1) Regulations in this section apply to the taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.\n\n(2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method unless you are restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations found in this section. The harvest limit specified in this section for a subsistence season for a species and the State harvest limit set for a State season for the same species are not cumulative, except as modified by regulations in paragraph (e) of this section. This means that if you have taken the harvest limit for a particular species under a subsistence season specified in this section, you may not, after that, take any additional fish of that species under any other harvest limit specified for a State season.\n\n(3) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter subsistence-taken fish or their parts that have been taken contrary to Federal law or regulation or State law or regulation (unless superseded by regulations in this part).\n\n(b) Methods, means, and general restrictions. (1) Unless otherwise specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence fishing permit (as may be modified by regulations in this section), you may use the following legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:\n\n(i) A set gillnet;\n\n(ii) A drift gillnet;\n\n(iii) A purse seine;\n\n(iv) A hand purse seine;\n\n(v) A beach seine;\n\n(vi) Troll gear;\n\n(vii) A fish wheel;\n\n(viii) A trawl;\n\n(ix) A pot;\n\n(x) A longline;\n\n(xi) A fyke net;\n\n(xii) A lead;\n\n(xiii) A herring pound;\n\n(xiv) A dip net;\n\n(xv) Jigging gear;\n\n(xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;\n\n(xvii) A handline;\n\n(xviii) A cast net;\n\n(xix) A rod and reel; and\n\n(xx) A spear.\n\n(2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:\n\n(i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely closed.\n\n(ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic timed-release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in saltwater, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the attachment points on the galvanic timed-release device. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.\n\n(3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 millimeter in diameter.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used to take fish for subsistence uses.\n\n(5) You may not use live nonindigenous fish as bait.\n\n(6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on the side of your fish wheel facing midstream of the river.\n\n(7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted gear in the following areas:\n\n(i) Kotzebue Area; and\n\n(ii) Norton Sound-Port Clarence Area.\n\n\n\n(8) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on each keg, buoy, stakes attached to gillnets, stakes identifying gear fished under the ice, and any other unattended fishing gear which you use to take fish for subsistence uses.\n\n(9) You may not use explosives or chemicals to take fish for subsistence uses.\n\n(10) You may not take fish for subsistence uses within 300 feet of any dam, fish ladder, weir, culvert or other artificial obstruction, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n(11) Transactions between rural residents. Rural residents may exchange in customary trade subsistence-harvested fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from other rural residents. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.\n\n(i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area—The total cash value per household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade to rural residents may not exceed $500.00 annually.\n\n(ii) Upper Copper River District—The total number of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade to rural residents may not exceed 50 percent of the annual harvest of salmon by the household. No more than 50 percent of the annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs (b)(11) and (12) of this section when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rests with the seller.\n\n(iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.\n\n(12) Transactions between a rural resident and others. In customary trade, a rural resident may exchange fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from individuals other than rural residents if the individual who purchases the fish, their parts, or their eggs uses them for personal or family consumption. If you are not a rural resident, you may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.\n\n(i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area—The total cash value per household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $400.00 annually. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.\n\n(ii) Upper Copper River District—The total cash value of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $500.00 annually. No more than 50 percent of the annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs (b)(11) and (12) of this section when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.\n\n(iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.\n\n(13) No sale to, nor purchase by, fisheries businesses. (i) You may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part to any individual, business, or organization required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or to any other business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1) as part of its business transactions.\n\n(ii) If you are required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or are a business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1), you may not purchase, receive, or sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part as part of your business transactions.\n\n(14) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, you may not take rainbow/steelhead trout.\n\n(15) You may not use fish taken for subsistence use or under subsistence regulations in this part as bait for commercial or sport fishing purposes.\n\n(16) Unless specified otherwise in this section, you may use a rod and reel to take fish without a subsistence fishing permit.

Such facilities shall be of sufficient size and design to provide unobstructed flow of water. Equipment will not be operated in streamcourses except at designated crossings and as essential to construction or removal of culverts and bridges. Any stream that is temporarily diverted must be restored to the natural course as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to a major runoff season. \n\n(14) Operator shall perform currently as weather and soil conditions permit, the following erosion control work on portions of the reserved area where logging is in progress or has been completed: Construct cross-ditches and water-spreading ditches where staked or otherwise marked on the ground by Forest Service; after a temporary road has served operator's purpose, operator shall remove culverts and bridges, eliminate ditches, out-slope and cross-drain roadbed and remove ruts and berms to the extent necessary to stabilize fills and otherwise minimize erosion; operator shall avoid felling into, yarding in, or crossing natural meadows; and operations will not take place when soil and water conditions are such that excessive damage will result. \n\n(b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (14) of this section shall not apply to reservations contained in conveyances of land to the United States under the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82, 16 U.S.C. 555). \n\n(c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision thereof, reserves timber rights for the cutting and removal of timber and timber products, in the conveyance of land to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service and there are provisions in the laws of such State or in conditions, rules and regulations promulgated by such State, agency or political subdivision thereof, which the Chief, Forest Service, determines are adequate to protect the interest of the United States in the event of the exercise of such reservation, the Chief, Forest Service, is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to subject the exercise of the reservation to such statutory provisions or such conditions, rules, and regulations in lieu of the conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (14) of this section.

          "content": "§ 251.54   Proposal and application requirements and procedures.\n(a) Early notice. When an individual or entity proposes to occupy and use National Forest System lands, the proponent is required to contact the Forest Service office(s) responsible for the management of the affected land as early as possible in advance of the proposed use.\n\n(b) Filing proposals. Proposals for special uses must be filed in writing with or presented orally to the District Ranger or Forest Supervisor having jurisdiction over the affected land (§ 200.2 of this chapter), except as follows:\n\n(1) Proposals for projects on lands under the jurisdiction of two or more administrative units of the Forest Service may be filed at the most convenient Forest Service office having jurisdiction over part of the project, and the proponent will be notified where to direct subsequent communications;\n\n(2) Proposals for cost-share and other road easements to be issued under § 251.53(j) must be filed in accordance with regulations in § 212.10(c) and (d) of this chapter; and\n\n(3) Proposals for oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way crossing Federal lands under the jurisdiction of two or more Federal agencies must be filed with the State Office, Bureau of Land Management, pursuant to regulations at 43 CFR part 2882.\n\n(c) Rights of proponents. A proposal to obtain a special use authorization does not grant any right or privilege to use National Forest System lands. Rights or privileges to occupy and use National Forest System lands under this subpart are conveyed only through issuance of a special use authorization.\n\n(d) Proposal content—(1) Proponent identification. Any proponent for a special use authorization must provide the proponent's name and mailing address, and, if the proponent is not an individual, the name and address of the proponent's agent who is authorized to receive notice of actions pertaining to the proposal.\n\n(2) Required information—(i) Noncommercial group uses. Paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section do not apply to proposed noncommercial group uses. A proponent for a noncommercial group use shall provide the following:\n\n(A) A description of the proposed activity;\n\n(B) The location and a description of the National Forest System lands and facilities the proponent would like to use;\n\n(C) The estimated number of participants and spectators;\n\n(D) The starting and ending time and date of the proposed activity; and\n\n(E) The name of the person or persons 21 years of age or older who will sign a special use authorization on behalf of the proponent.\n\n(ii) All other special uses. At a minimum, proposals for special uses other than noncommercial group uses must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section. In addition, if requested by an authorized officer, a proponent in one of the following categories must furnish the information specified for that category:\n\n(A) If the proponent is a State or local government agency: a copy of the authorization under which the proposal is made;\n\n(B) If the proponent is a public corporation: the statute or other authority under which it was organized;\n\n(C) If the proponent is a Federal Government agency: the title of the agency official delegated the authority to file the proposal;\n\n(D) If the proponent is a private corporation:\n\n(1) Evidence of incorporation and its current good standing;\n\n(2) If reasonably obtainable by the proponent, the name and address of each shareholder owning three percent or more of the shares, together with the number and percentage of any class of voting shares of the entity which such shareholder is authorized to vote;\n\n(3) The name and address of each affiliate of the entity;\n\n(4) In the case of an affiliate which is controlled by the entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of the affiliate that the entity owns either directly or indirectly; or\n\n(5) In the case of an affiliate which controls that entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that entity owned, either directly or indirectly by the affiliate; or\n\n(E) If the proponent is a partnership, association, or other unincorporated entity: a certified copy of the partnership agreement or other similar document, if any, creating the entity, or a certificate of good standing under the laws of the State.\n\n(3) Technical and financial capability. The proponent is required to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the authorized officer that the proponent has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the technical and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the project for which an authorization is requested, and the proponent is otherwise acceptable.\n\n(4) Project description. Except for requests for planning permits for a major development, a proponent must provide a project description, including maps and appropriate resource information, in sufficient detail to enable the authorized officer to determine the feasibility of a proposed project or activity, any benefits to be provided to the public, the safety of the proposal, the lands to be occupied or used, the terms and conditions to be included, and the proposal's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders.\n\n(5) Additional information. The authorized officer may require any other information and data necessary to determine feasibility of a project or activity proposed; compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders; compliance with requirements for associated clearances, certificates, permits, or licenses; and suitable terms and conditions to be included in the authorization. The authorized officer shall make requests for any additional information in writing.\n\n(e) Pre-application actions—(1) Initial screening. Upon receipt of a request for any proposed use other than for noncommercial group use, the authorized officer shall screen the proposal to ensure that the use meets the following minimum requirements applicable to all special uses:\n\n(i) The proposed use is consistent with the laws, regulations, orders, and policies establishing or governing National Forest System lands, with other applicable Federal law, and with applicable State and local health and sanitation laws.\n\n(ii) The proposed use is consistent or can be made consistent with standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan prepared under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219.\n\n(iii) The proposed use will not pose a serious or substantial risk to public health or safety.\n\n(iv) Except for permanent easements issued under § 251.53(j), the proposed use will not create an exclusive or perpetual right of use or occupancy.\n\n(v) The proposed use will not unreasonably conflict or interfere with administrative use by the Forest Service, other scheduled or authorized existing uses of the National Forest System, or use of adjacent non-National Forest System lands.\n\n(vi) The proponent does not have any delinquent debt owed to the Forest Service under terms and conditions of a prior or existing authorization, unless such debt results from a decision on an administrative appeal or from a fee review and the proponent is current with the payment schedule.\n\n(vii) The proposed use does not involve gambling or providing of sexually oriented commercial services, even if permitted under State law.\n\n(viii) The proposed use does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded.\n\n(ix) The proposed use does not involve disposal of solid waste or disposal of radioactive or other hazardous substances.\n\n(2) Results of initial screening. Any proposed use other than a noncommercial group use that does not meet all of the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section shall not receive further evaluation and processing. In such event, the authorized officer shall advise the proponent that the use does not meet the minimum requirements. If the proposal was submitted orally, the authorized officer may respond orally. If the proposal was made in writing, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing that the proposed use does not meet the minimum requirements and shall simultaneously return the request.\n\n(3) Guidance and information to proponents. For proposals for noncommercial group use as well as for those proposals that meet the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix), the authorized officer, to the extent practicable, shall provide the proponent guidance and information on the following:\n\n(i) Possible land use conflicts as identified by review of forest land and resource management plans, landownership records, and other readily available sources;\n\n(ii) Proposal and application procedures and probable time requirements;\n\n(iii) Proponent qualifications;\n\n(iv) Applicable fees, charges, bonding, and/or security requirements;\n\n(v) Necessary associated clearances, permits, and licenses;\n\n(vi) Environmental and management considerations;\n\n(vii) Special conditions; and\n\n(viii) identification of on-the-ground investigations which will require temporary use permits.\n\n(4) Confidentiality. If requested by the proponent, the authorized officer, or other Forest Service official, to the extent reasonable and authorized by law, shall hold confidential any project and program information revealed during pre-application contacts.\n\n(5) Second-level screening of proposed uses. A proposal which passes the initial screening set forth in paragraph (e)(1) and for which the proponent has submitted information as required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, proceeds to second-level screening and consideration. In order to complete this screening and consideration, the authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects. An authorized officer shall reject any proposal, including a proposal for commercial group uses, if, upon further consideration, the officer determines that:\n\n(i) The proposed use would be inconsistent or incompatible with the purposes for which the lands are managed, or with other uses; or\n\n(ii) The proposed use would not be in the public interest; or\n\n(iii) The proponent is not qualified; or\n\n(iv) The proponent does not or cannot demonstrate technical or economic feasibility of the proposed use or the financial or technical capability to undertake the use and to fully comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization; or\n\n(v) There is no person or entity authorized to sign a special use authorization and/or there is no person or entity willing to accept responsibility for adherence to the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n(6) NEPA compliance for second-level screening process. A request for a special use authorization that does not meet the criteria established in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(v) of this section does not constitute an agency proposal as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23 and, therefore, does not require environmental analysis and documentation.\n\n(f) Special requirements for certain proposals—(1) Oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way. An individual proposing an oil or gas pipeline right-of-way must be a United States citizen and must provide proof of United States citizenship. An entity proposing an oil or gas pipeline right-of-way must be established, and must provide documentation that the entity was established, under the laws of the United States, a state or territory of the United States, or in the case of coal, oil, shale, or gas, a municipality of the United States.\n\n(i) Citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations of which deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States, shall not by stock ownership, stock holding, or stock control own an appreciable interest in any oil or gas pipeline right-of-way or associated special use authorization; and\n\n(ii) The authorized officer shall promptly notify the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources upon receipt of a proposal for a right-of-way for a pipeline 24 inches or more in diameter, and no right-of-way for that pipeline shall be granted until notice of intention to grant the right-of-way, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings as to the term and conditions the authorized officer proposes to impose, have been submitted to the committees.\n\n(2) Major development. Proponents of a major development may submit a request for a planning permit of up to 10 years in duration. Requests for a planning permit must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of a master development plan developed under a planning permit, proponents may then submit a request for a long-term authorization to construct and operate the development. At a minimum, a request for a long-term permit for a major development must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(5) of this section. Issuance of a planning permit does not prejudice approval or denial of a subsequent request for a special use permit for the development.\n\n(g) Application processing and response—(1) Acceptance of applications. Except for proposed noncommercial group uses, if a proposed use does not meet both the initial and second-level screening criteria in paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall reject the proposal. The authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing of the rejection and the reasons for the rejection. If a proposed use meets both the initial and second-level screening criteria in paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent that the proponent may submit a written application for evaluation under this paragraph. The authorized officer shall, as appropriate or necessary, provide the proponent guidance and information of the type described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section.\n\n(2) Processing applications. (i) Upon acceptance of an application for a special use authorization other than a planning permit, the authorized officer shall evaluate the proposed use for the requested site, including effects on the environment. The authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects.\n\n(ii) Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public shall receive adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon a special use proposal accepted as a formal application in accordance with Forest Service NEPA procedures.\n\n(iii) The authorized officer shall give due deference to the findings of another agency such as a Public Utility Commission, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, or the Interstate Commerce Commission in lieu of another detailed finding. If this information is already on file with the Forest Service, it need not be refiled, if reference is made to the previous filing date, place, and case number.\n\n(iv) Applications for noncommercial group uses must be received at least 72 hours in advance of the proposed activity. Applications for noncommercial group uses shall be processed in order of receipt, and the use of a particular area shall be allocated in order of receipt of fully executed applications, subject to any relevant limitations set forth in this section.\n\n(v) For applications for planning permits, including those issued for a major development as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the authorized officer shall assess only the applicant's financial and technical qualifications and determine compliance with other applicable laws, regulations, and orders. Planning permits may be categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement pursuant to Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (36 CFR 200.4).\n\n(3) Response to applications for noncommercial group uses. (i) All applications for noncommercial group uses shall be deemed granted and an authorization shall be issued for those uses pursuant to the determination as set forth below, unless applications are denied within 48 hours of receipt. Where an application for a noncommercial group use has been granted or is deemed to have been granted and an authorization has been issued under this paragraph, an authorized officer may revoke that authorization only as provided under § 251.60(a)(1)(i).\n\n(ii) An authorized officer shall grant an application for a special use authorization for a noncommercial group use upon a determination that:\n\n(A) Authorization of the proposed activity is not prohibited by the rules at 36 CFR part 261, subpart B, or by Federal, State, or local law unrelated to the content of expressive activity;\n\n(B) Authorization of the proposed activity is consistent or can be made consistent with the standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan required under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219;\n\n(C) The proposed activity does not materially impact the characteristics or functions of the environmentally sensitive resources or lands identified in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, chapter 30;\n\n(D) The proposed activity will not delay, halt, or prevent administrative use of an area by the Forest Service or other scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands, including but not limited to uses and activities authorized under parts 222, 223, 228, and 251 of this chapter;\n\n(E) The proposed activity does not violate State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site. Issues addressed by State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site include but are not limited to:\n\n(1) The sufficiency of sanitation facilities;\n\n(2) The sufficiency of waste-disposal facilities;\n\n(3) The availability of sufficient potable drinking water;\n\n(4) The risk of disease from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site; and\n\n(5) The risk of contamination of the water supply;\n\n(F) The proposed activity will not pose a substantial danger to public safety. Considerations of public safety must not include concerns about possible reaction to the users' identity or beliefs from non-members of the group that is seeking an authorization and shall be limited to the following:\n\n(1) The potential for physical injury to other forest users from the proposed activity;\n\n(2) The potential for physical injury to users from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site;\n\n(3) The potential for physical injury to users from scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands; and\n\n(4) The adequacy of ingress and egress in case of an emergency;\n\n(G) The proposed activity does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded; and\n\n(H) A person or persons 21 years of age or older have been designated to sign and do sign a special use authorization on behalf of the applicant.\n\n(iii) If an authorized officer denies an application because it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial. If an alternative time, place, or manner will allow the applicant to meet the eight evaluation criteria, an authorized officer shall offer that alternative. If an application is denied solely under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and all alternatives suggested are unacceptable to the applicant, the authorized officer shall offer to have completed the requisite environmental and other analyses for the requested site. An environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement prepared for the requested site is subject to the predecisional objection procedures at 36 CFR part 218. Notwithstanding the timing provisions set forth in 36 CFR 218.12, a decision to grant or deny an application for which an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is prepared for the requested site shall be made within 48 hours after the time for filing an objection expires or, if an objection is filed, the objection process is completed. A denial of an application in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section constitutes final agency action, is not subject to administrative appeal, and is immediately subject to judicial review.\n\n(4) Response to all other applications—(i) General. Based on evaluation of the information provided by the applicant and other relevant information such as environmental findings, the authorized officer shall decide whether to approve the proposed use, approve the proposed use with modifications, or deny the proposed use. A group of applications for similar uses may be evaluated with one analysis and approved in one decision.\n\n(ii) Communications use applications. Within 270 days of acceptance of a proposal as an application for a new communications facility or co-location of a new communications use in or on a facility managed by the Forest Service, or within 270 days of receipt of an application for modification of an existing communications facility or co-located communications use on a facility managed by the Forest Service, the authorized officer shall grant or deny the application and notify the applicant in writing of the grant or denial.\n\n(iii) Tracking of communications use applications. The Forest Service shall establish a process in its directive system (36 CFR 200.4) for tracking applications for communications uses that provides for:\n\n(A) Identifying the number of applications received, approved, and denied;\n\n(B) For applications that are denied, describing the reasons for denial; and\n\n(C) Describing the amount of time between receipt of an application and grant or denial of the application.\n\n(5) Authorization of a special use—(i) General. Upon a decision to approve a special use or a group of similar uses, the authorized officer may issue one or more special use authorizations as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.\n\n(ii) Minimum term for communications use authorizations. The term for a communications use authorization shall be 30 years, unless case-specific circumstances warrant a shorter term.\n\n[63 FR 65964, Nov. 30, 1998, as amended at 74 FR 68381, Dec. 24, 2009; 78 FR 33725, June 5, 2013; 85 FR 19665, Apr. 8, 2020; 88 FR 84707, Dec. 6, 2023]",

The holder may lease the authorized facilities and improvements to other parties only with the prior written approval of the authorized officer. The holder shall remain responsible for compliance of facilities and improvements leased to other parties with all the terms of the holder's special use authorization.\n\n(b) All rights not expressly granted are retained by the United States, including but not limited to (1) continuing rights of access to all National Forest System land (including the subsurface and air space); (2) a continuing right of physical entry to any part of the authorized facilities for inspection, monitoring, or for any other purposes or reason consistent with any right or obligation of the United States under any law or regulation; and (3) the right to require common use of the land or to authorize the use by others in any way not inconsistent with a holder's existing rights and privileges after consultation with all parties and agencies involved. When costs can be feasibly allocated and have not been amortized, a new holder may be required to compensate existing holders for an equitable proportion of the original costs or other expense associated with the common use. \n\n(c) Special use authorizations are subject to all outstanding valid rights. \n\n(d) Each special use authorization will specify the lands to be used or occupied which shall be limited to that which the authorized officer determines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to be necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full utilization of the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized activities; and, (3) to be necessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment. \n\n(e) The holder will secure permission under applicable law, and pay in advance, the value as determined by the authorized officer for any mineral and vegetative materials (including timber) to be cut, removed, used, or destroyed by the holder from the authorized use area or other National Forest System land.

          "content": "§ 251.56   Terms and conditions.\n(a) General. (1) Each special use authorization must contain:\n\n(i) Terms and conditions which will:\n\n(A) Carry out the purposes of applicable statutes and rules and regulations issued thereunder;\n\n(B) Minimize damage to scenic and esthetic values and fish and wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment;\n\n(C) Require compliance with applicable air and water quality standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or State law; and\n\n(D) Require compliance with State standards for public health and safety, environmental protection, and siting, construction, operation, and maintenance if those standards are more stringent than applicable Federal standards.\n\n(ii) Such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems necessary to:\n\n(A) Protect Federal property and economic interests;\n\n(B) Manage efficiently the lands subject to the use and adjacent thereto;\n\n(C) Protect other lawful users of the lands adjacent to or occupied by such use;\n\n(D) Protect lives and property;\n\n(E) Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area of the use who rely on the fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes;\n\n(F) Require siting to cause the least damage to the environment, taking into consideration feasibility and other relevant factors; and\n\n(G) Otherwise protect the public interest.\n\n\nNote to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G):\nThe Department is making explicit its preexisting understanding of § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) of this subpart in the context of authorizing noncommercial group uses of National Forest System lands. Section 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) provides that each special use authorization shall contain such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems necessary to otherwise protect the public interest. In the context of noncommercial group uses, the Forest Service interprets the term “public interest” found in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) to refer to the three public interests identified by the Forest Service on August 30, 1995. These public interests include the protection of resources and improvements on National Forest System lands, the allocation of space among potential or existing uses and activities, and public health and safety concerns. Under this construction, § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) allows the Forest Service to impose terms and conditions that are not specifically addressed in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(F) but only those that further these public interests. The Forest Service shall implement and enforce § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) in accordance with this interpretation.\n(2) Authorizations for use of National Forest System lands may be conditioned to require State, county, or other Federal agency licenses, permits, certificates, or other approval documents, such as a Federal Communication Commission license, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license, a State water right, or a county building permit.\n\n(b) Duration and renewability—(1) Requirements. If appropriate, each special use authorization will specify its duration and renewability. The duration shall be no longer than the authorized officer determines to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the authorization and to be reasonable in light of all circumstances concerning the use, including \n\n(i) Resource management direction contained in land management and other plans;\n\n(ii) Public benefits provided;\n\n(iii) Cost and life expectancy of the authorized facilities;\n\n(iv) Financial arrangements for the project; and\n\n(v) The life expectancy of associated facilities, licenses, etc. Except for special use authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, authorizations exceeding 30 years shall provide for revision of terms and conditions at specified intervals to reflect changing times and conditions. \n\n(2) Ski area permits. (i) For authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized officer finds that the ski area development meets the following standards: \n\n(A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 years; \n\n(B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of capital is in ski-related facilities; \n\n(C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation and maintenance costs; \n\n(D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, located predominately on land authorized under a permit;\n\n(E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or operation;\n\n(F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities within the authorized ski area.\n\n(ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized officer's discretion:\n\n(A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;\n\n(B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; or\n\n(C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 219).\n\n(c) Preconstruction approvals. Forest Service approval of location, design and plans (or standards, if appropriate) of all developments within the authorized area will be required prior to construction. \n\n(d) Liability. Holders shall pay the United States for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in accordance with existing Federal and State laws. \n\n(1) Holders shall also indemnify the United States for any and all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, the United States may suffer as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments caused by the holder's use or occupancy. \n\n(2) Holders of special use authorizations for high risk use and occupancy, such as, but not limited to, powerlines and oil and gas pipelines, shall be held liable for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder's use or occupancy, without regard to the holder's negligence, provided that maximum liability shall be specified in the special use authorization as determined by a risk assessment, prepared in accordance with established agency procedures, but shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one occurrence. Liability for injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in excess of the specified maximum shall be determined by the laws governing ordinary negligence of the jurisdiction in which the damage or injury occurred.\n\n(e) Bonding. An authorized officer may require the holder of a special use authorization for other than a noncommercial group use to furnish a bond or other security to secure all or any of the obligations imposed by the terms of the authorization or by any applicable law, regulation or order.\n\n(f) Special terms and conditions—(1) Public service enterprises. Special use permits authorizing the operation of public service enterprises shall require that the permittee charge reasonable rates and furnish such services as may be necessary in the public interest, except where such rates and services are regulated by Federal, State or municipal agencies having jurisdiction. \n\n(2) Common carriers. Oil and gas pipelines and related facilities authorized under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 449, as amended (30 U.S.C. 185), shall be constructed, operated and maintained as common carriers. The owners or operators of pipelines shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil or gas was produced on Federal or nonfederal lands. In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from the resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported, or purchased. The common carrier provisions of this section shall not apply to any natural gas pipeline operated (i) by any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 717) or (ii) by any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not subject to State regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall purchase, without discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of the pipeline. \n\n(g) [Reserved]\n\n\n\n(h) Operating plans and agreements. An operating plan or agreement consistent with this paragraph (h) is required for new and reauthorized powerline facilities on National Forest System lands.\n\n(1) Use of operating plans. Operating plans, rather than agreements, are required for powerline facilities that are subject to the mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization and that sold more than 1,000,000 megawatt hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale during each of the 3 calendar years immediately preceding March 23, 2018.\n\n(2) Use of operating agreements. Powerline facilities that are not subject to the mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization and/or that sold less than or equal to 1,000,000 megawatt hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale during each of the 3 calendar years immediately preceding March 23, 2018, may be subject to an agreement, instead of an operating plan. Powerline facilities that are not subject to an agreement must be subject to an operating plan.\n\n(3) Existing operating plans and lack of an operating plan. The authorized officer shall determine, in consultation with the owner or operator of a powerline facility, whether the existing operating plan for that powerline facility is consistent with paragraph (h) of this section and shall notify the owner or operator of that determination. Within 18 months of the date of notification that the existing operating plan is inconsistent with paragraph (h) of this section, the owner or operator shall modify the existing operating plan to be consistent with paragraph (h) of this section or, if eligible, shall prepare a proposed operating agreement and shall submit the proposed modified operating plan or proposed operating agreement to the authorized officer for review and approval. Existing operating plans that are consistent with paragraph (h) of this section do not have to be submitted for reapproval by the authorized officer. If an owner or operator does not have an operating plan, within 18 months of the date of notification from the authorized officer that a proposed operating plan or agreement must be submitted, the owner or operator shall submit to the authorized officer a proposed operating plan or agreement consistent with paragraph (h) of this section for review and approval. The authorized officer shall provide notification of the requirement to submit a proposed modified operating plan or a proposed operating plan or agreement no later than September 30, 2026. The authorized officer has the discretion to determine the sequence of notification, based on factors enumerated in implementing Forest Service directives.\n\n(4) Development of proposed operating plans and agreements. Owners and operators may develop a proposed operating plan or agreement on their own or in consultation with the authorized officer.\n\n(5) Content of operating plans and agreements. At a minimum, operating plans and agreements shall:\n\n(i) Identify the powerline facility covered by the operating plan or agreement (hereinafter “covered line”);\n\n(ii) Consider preexisting operating plans and agreements for the covered line;\n\n(iii) Address coordination between the owner or operator and the Forest Service and specify their points of contact;\n\n(iv) Describe the vegetation management, inspection, and operation and maintenance methods that may be used to comply with all applicable law, including fire safety requirements and reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization (owners and operators subject to mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization or superseding standards may use those standards as part of their operating plan); the applicable land management plan; environmental compliance; resource protection; fire control; routine, non-routine, and emergency maintenance of the covered line; and road and trail construction, reconstruction, and maintenance in support of the covered line;\n\n(v) Identify best management practices for vegetation management; the applicable minimum vegetation clearance distance; procedures for designating, marking, and removing or pruning hazard trees and other vegetation; and road and trail standards and best management practices;\n\n(vi) Address the types of activities that shall be allowed by the owner or operator upon approval of the operating plan or agreement by the authorized officer without additional prior written approval as a new, changed, or additional use or area under 36 CFR 251.61, including routine vegetation management and routine maintenance, and those activities that shall require additional prior written approval from the authorized officer as a new, changed, or additional use or area under 36 CFR 251.61, including but not limited to non-routine maintenance and construction of roads and trails in support of the covered line;\n\n(vii) Specify timeframes for:\n\n(A) The owner or operator to notify the authorized officer of routine, non-routine, and emergency maintenance of the covered line and routine and emergency vegetation management for the covered line;\n\n(B) The owner or operator to request approval from the authorized officer of non-routine maintenance of and routine vegetation management for the covered line; and\n\n(C) The authorized officer to respond to a request by the owner or operator for approval of non-routine maintenance of and routine vegetation management for the covered line;\n\n(viii) Include the following procedures with regard to whether authorized officer approval is required for vegetation management:\n\n(A) Routine vegetation management. Routine vegetation management must have prior written approval from the authorized officer, unless all 3 of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The owner or operator has submitted a request for approval to the authorized officer in accordance with the specified timeframe in the approved operating plan or agreement;\n\n(2) The proposed routine vegetation management is covered by approval of a proposed operating plan or agreement or by subsequent case-by-case environmental analysis and consultation; and\n\n(3) The authorized officer has failed to respond to the request in accordance with the specified timeframe in the approved operating plan or agreement.\n\n(B) Emergency vegetation management. Emergency vegetation management does not require prior written approval from the authorized officer. The owner or operator shall notify the authorized officer by email of the location and type of emergency vegetation management as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours after completion. Within 30 days of completion, the owner or operator shall submit to the authorized officer a written report detailing at a minimum the location, type, and scope of emergency vegetation management conducted, the reason it was conducted, the methods used to conduct it, and the resulting benefit;\n\n(ix) Include the following procedures for modification of an approved operating plan or agreement:\n\n(A) The authorized officer shall give the owner or operator of the covered line prior notice of any changed conditions that warrant a modification of the approved operating plan or agreement;\n\n(B) The authorized officer shall give the owner or operator an opportunity to submit a proposed modification of the approved operating plan or agreement, consistent with the procedures described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, to address the changed conditions;\n\n(C) The authorized officer shall consider the proposed modification consistent with the procedures described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section; and\n\n(D) The owner or operator may continue to implement the approved operating plan or agreement to the extent it does not directly and adversely affect the conditions prompting the modification; and\n\n(x) For agreements only, reflect the relative financial resources of the owner or operator of the covered line compared to other owners or operators of a powerline facility.\n\n(6) Review and approval of proposed operating plans and agreements. Proposed operating plans and agreements shall be submitted to the authorized officer for review and approval in writing before they are implemented. Proposed operating plans and agreements shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with procedures developed jointly by the Forest Service and the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, which shall be consistent with applicable law. These procedures shall:\n\n(i) Provide that a proposed operating plan or agreement or proposed modification to an approved operating plan or agreement shall be approved, to the maximum extent practicable, within 120 days from the date the proposed operating plan or agreement or proposed modification was received by the authorized officer, with the understanding that such factors as the number of proposed operating plans and agreements under review by an authorized officer and the number of powerline facilities covered under a single operating plan or agreement may affect the practicability of approving a proposed operating plan or agreement within 120 days from the date of receipt; and\n\n(ii) Specify a timeframe for submission of applicable Agency comments on a proposed operating plan or agreement.\n\n(7) Review and expiration of approved operating plans and agreements. At least every 10 years from the approval date of an operating plan or agreement, the owner or operator shall review and, as necessary or appropriate, propose updates to the operating plan or agreement to ensure consistency with changed conditions. Proposed updates to an approved operating plan or agreement that are deemed significant by the authorized officer shall be treated as proposed modifications and shall be submitted by the owner or operator for review and approval by the authorized officer in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section. Proposed updates that are deemed non-significant by the authorized officer may be made by written agreement of the owner or operator and the authorized officer. Upon expiration of a special use authorization for a powerline facility, the owner or operator shall prepare a new proposed operating plan or agreement, either solely or in consultation with the authorized officer, and shall submit it to the authorized officer for review and approval in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.\n\n(8) Reporting of requests and responses to requests for routine vegetation management. The Forest Service shall annually report on its website requests for approval of routine vegetation management pursuant to paragraph (h)(5)(viii)(A) of this section and responses to those requests.\n\n(9) Strict Liability. (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, strict liability in tort may not be imposed on an owner or operator for injury or damages resulting from the authorized officer's unreasonably withholding or delaying approval of an operating plan or agreement or unreasonably failing to adhere to an applicable schedule in an approved operating plan or agreement.\n\n(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for 10 years from March 23, 2018, strict liability in tort for injury or damages resulting from activities conducted by an owner or operator under an approved agreement may not exceed $500,000 per incident.\n\n(10) Forest Service directives. To enhance the reliability of the electric grid and to reduce the threat of wildfire damage to, and wildfire caused by vegetation-related conditions within or on, powerline facility rights-of-way and by hazard trees on abutting National Forest System lands, the Forest Service shall issue and periodically update directives in its directive system (36 CFR 200.4) to ensure that provisions are appropriately developed and implemented for powerline facility vegetation management, powerline facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of powerline facility rights-of-way. The directives shall:\n\n(i) Be developed in consultation with owners;\n\n(ii) Be compatible with mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization;\n\n(iii) Consider all applicable law, including fire safety and electrical system reliability requirements, such as reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization;\n\n(iv) Consider the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding on Vegetation Management for Powerline Rights-of-Way Among the Edison Electric Institute, Utility Arborist Association, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and any successor memorandum of understanding;\n\n(v) Seek to minimize the need for case-by-case approvals for routine vegetation management (including hazard tree felling and pruning), powerline facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of powerline facilities; and\n\n(vi) Provide for prompt and timely review of requests to conduct routine vegetation management.\n\n[45 FR 38327, June 6, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 46895, Nov. 29, 1984; 54 FR 22594, May 25, 1989; 60 FR 45294, Aug. 30, 1995; 63 FR 65967, Nov. 30, 1998; 64 FR 48960, Sept. 9, 1999; 85 FR 41393, July 10, 2020; 85 FR 48476, Aug. 11, 2020; 87 FR 7950, Feb. 11, 2022; 90 FR 23866, June 5, 2025]",

If an applicant or a holder is ineligible for a land use fee waiver under one criterion in this paragraph, the applicant or holder is ineligible for a land use fee waiver under any other criteria in this paragraph:\n\n(1) The holder is a State or local government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, excluding municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue from the authorized use is customer charges;\n\n(2) The holder is a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation, which is not controlled or owned by profit-making corporations or business enterprises, and which is engaged in public or semi-public activity to further public health, safety, or welfare, except that free use will not be authorized when funds derived by the holder through the authorization are used to increase the value of the authorized improvements owned by the holder or are used to support other activities of the holder;\n\n(3) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced charge, a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary;\n\n(4) When the land use fee is included in the land use fee for an authorized use or occupancy for which the United States is already receiving compensation;\n\n(5) When a right-of-way is authorized in reciprocation for a right-of-way conveyed to the United States; or\n\n(6) For rights-of-way involving cost-share roads or reciprocal right-of-way agreements.\n\n(c) No rental fee will be charged when the holder is the Federal government. \n\n(d) No fee shall be charged when the authorization is for a noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.\n\n(e) Special use authorizations issued under § 251.53(g) of this part may require as all or a part of the consideration the reconditioning and maintenance of the government-owned or controlled structures, improvements, and land to a satisfactory standard. The total consideration will be based upon the fair market value of the rights and privileges authorized. \n\n(f) Special use authorizations involving government-owned or controlled buildings, structures, or other improvements which require caretakers' services, or the furnishing of special services such as water, electric lights, and clean-up, may require the payment of an additional fee or charge to cover the cost of such services. \n\n(g) Except where specified otherwise by terms of a special use authorization, rental fees may be initiated or adjusted whenever necessary: (1) As a result of fee review, reappraisal; or (2) upon a change in the holder's qualifications under paragraph (b) of this section; and (3) notice is given prior to initiating or adjusting rental fees. \n\n(h) Each ski area permit issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act shall include a clause that provides that the Forest Service may adjust and calculate future land use fees to reflect Forest Service revisions to the existing system for determining land use fees based on fair market value or to comply with any new system for determining land use fees based on fair market value that may be adopted after issuance of the permit.\n\n(i) The annual land use fee for a recreation residence permit shall be temporarily reduced during periods of significantly restricted access to or occupancy of the recreation residence. A temporary land use fee reduction for significantly restricted access to or occupancy of a recreation residence shall be calculated by dividing the annual land use fee for the recreation residence permit by 365 to determine the daily land use fee and then multiplying the daily land use fee by the number of days of significantly restricted access to or occupancy of the recreation residence. If significantly restricted access to or occupancy of the recreation residence includes part of one day, that day shall be counted as a whole day. A temporary land use fee reduction during significantly restricted access to or occupancy of a recreation residence shall be applied as a credit to the annual land use fee for the recreation residence permit for the following year.\n\n[45 FR 38327, June 6, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 16683, May 6, 1986; 54 FR 22594, May 25, 1989; 60 FR 45294, Aug. 30, 1995; 63 FR 65967, Nov. 30, 1998; 71 FR 16621, Apr. 3, 2006; 88 FR 84708, Dec. 6, 2023; 89 FR 72994, Sept. 9, 2024]",

          "section_name": "§ 251.58   Cost recovery.",
          "content": "§ 251.58   Cost recovery.\n(a) Assessment of fees to recover agency processing and monitoring costs. The Forest Service shall assess fees to recover the agency's processing costs for special use applications and monitoring costs for special use authorizations. Applicants and holders shall submit sufficient information for the authorized officer to estimate the number of hours required to process their applications or monitor their authorizations. Cost recovery fees are separate from any fees charged for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands.\n\n(b) Special use applications and authorizations subject to cost recovery requirements. Except as exempted in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section, the cost recovery requirements of this section apply in the following situations to the processing of special use applications and monitoring of special use authorizations issued pursuant to this subpart:\n\n(1) Applications for use and occupancy that require a new special use authorization. Fees for processing an application for a new special use authorization shall apply to any application formally accepted by the agency on or after March 23, 2006 and to any application formally accepted by the agency before March 23, 2006, which the agency has not commenced processing. Proposals accepted as applications which the agency has commenced processing prior to March 23, 2006 shall not be subject to processing fees. The cost recovery provisions of this section shall not apply to or supersede written agreements providing for recovery of processing costs executed by the agency and applicants prior to March 23, 2006.\n\n(2) Changes to existing authorizations. Processing fees apply to proposals that require an application to amend or formally approve specific activities or facilities as identified in an existing authorization, operating plan, or master development plan. Processing fees also apply to agency actions to amend a special use authorization.\n\n(3) Agency actions to issue a special use authorization and applications for issuance of a new special use authorization due to termination of an existing authorization, including termination caused by expiration, a change in ownership or control of the authorized facilities, or a change in ownership or control of the holder of the authorization. Upon termination of an existing authorization, a holder shall be subject to a processing fee for issuance of a new authorization, even if the holder's existing authorization does not require submission of an application for a new authorization.\n\n(4) Monitoring of authorizations issued or amended on or after March 23, 2006.\n\n(c) Processing fee requirements. A processing fee is required for each application for or agency action to issue a special use authorization as identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Processing fees do not include costs incurred by the applicant in providing information, data, and documentation necessary for the authorized officer to make a decision on the proposed use or occupancy pursuant to the provisions at § 251.54.\n\n(1) Basis for processing fees. The processing fee categories 1 through 6 set out in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section are based upon the costs that the Forest Service incurs in reviewing the application, conducting environmental analyses of the effects of the proposed use, reviewing any applicant-generated environmental documents and studies, conducting site visits, evaluating an applicant's technical and financial qualifications, making a decision on whether to issue the authorization, and preparing documentation of analyses, decisions, and authorizations for each application. The processing fee for an application shall be based only on costs necessary for processing that application. “Necessary for” means that but for the application, the costs would not have been incurred and that the costs cover only those activities without which the application cannot be processed. The processing fee shall not include costs for studies for programmatic planning or analysis or other agency management objectives, unless they are necessary for the application being processed. For example, the processing fee shall not include costs for capacity studies, use allocation decisions, corridor or communications site planning, and biological studies that address species diversity, unless they are necessary for the application. Proportional costs for analyses, such as capacity studies, that are necessary for an application may be included in the processing fee for that application. The costs incurred for processing an application, and thus the processing fee, depend on the complexity of the project; the amount of information that is necessary for the authorized officer's decision in response to the proposed use and occupancy; and the degree to which the applicant can provide this information to the agency. Processing work conducted by the applicant or a third party contracted by the applicant minimizes the costs the Forest Service will incur to process the application, and thus reduces the processing fee. The total processing time is the total time estimated for all Forest Service personnel involved in processing an application and is estimated case by case to determine the fee category.\n\n(i) Processing fee determinations. The applicable fee rate for processing applications in minor categories 1 through 4 (paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section) shall be assessed from a schedule. The processing fee for applications in category 5, which may be either minor or major, shall be established in the master agreement (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section). For major category 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) and category 6 (paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section) cases, the authorized officer shall estimate the agency's full actual processing costs. The estimated processing costs for category 5 and category 6 cases shall be reconciled as provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) and (c)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section.\n\n(ii) Reduction in processing fees for certain category 6 applications. For category 6 applications submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the applicant:\n\n(A) May request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the applicant's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights and privileges sought, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency processing involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the applicant in writing of this determination; or\n\n(B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in processing the application.\n\n(2) Processing fee categories. No fee is charged for applications taking 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to process. Applications requiring more than 1 hour for the agency to process are covered by the fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs i through vi.\n\n(i) Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.\n\n(ii) Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.\n\n(iii) Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.\n\n(iv) Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.\n\n(v) Category 5: Master agreements. The Forest Service and the applicant may enter into master agreements for the agency to recover processing costs associated with a particular application, a group of applications, or similar applications for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category application submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, an applicant waives the right to request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:\n\n(A) The fee category or estimated processing costs;\n\n(B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing;\n\n(C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;\n\n(D) A work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;\n\n(E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final processing costs; and\n\n(F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.\n\n(vi) Category 6: More than 50 hours. In this major category more than 50 hours are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application. The authorized officer shall determine the issues to be addressed and shall develop preliminary work and financial plans for estimating recoverable costs.\n\n(3) Multiple applications other than those covered by master agreements (category 5). (i) Unsolicited applications where there is no competitive interest. Processing costs that are incurred in processing more than one of these applications (such as the cost of environmental analysis or printing an environmental impact statement that relates to all of the applications) must be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by each applicant, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.\n\n(ii) Unsolicited proposals where competitive interest exists. When there is one or more unsolicited proposals and the authorized officer determines that competitive interest exists, the agency shall issue a prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. The applicants are responsible for the costs of environmental analyses that are necessary for their applications and that are conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.\n\n(iii) Solicited applications. When the Forest Service solicits applications through the issuance of a prospectus on its own initiative, rather than in response to an unsolicited proposal or proposals, the agency is responsible for the cost of environmental analyses conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.\n\n(4) Billing and revision of processing fees. (i) Billing. When the Forest Service accepts a special use application, the authorized officer shall provide written notice to the applicant that the application has been formally accepted. The authorized officer shall not bill the applicant a processing fee until the agency is prepared to process the application.\n\n(ii) Revision of processing fees. Minor category processing fees shall not be reclassified into a higher minor category once the processing fee category has been determined. However, if the authorized officer discovers previously undisclosed information that necessitates changing a minor category processing fee to a major category processing fee, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant or holder of the conditions prompting a change in the processing fee category in writing before continuing with processing the application. The applicant or holder may accept the revised processing fee category and pay the difference between the previous and revised processing categories; withdraw the application; revise the project to lower the processing costs; or request review of the disputed fee as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section.\n\n(5) Payment of processing fees. (i) Payment of a processing fee shall be due within 30 days of issuance of a bill for the fee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The processing fee must be paid before the Forest Service can initiate or, in the case of a revised fee, continue with processing an application. Payment of the processing fee by the applicant does not obligate the Forest Service to authorize the applicant's proposed use and occupancy.\n\n(ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated processing costs are lower than the final processing costs for applications covered by a master agreement, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and final processing costs.\n\n(iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated processing fee is lower than the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and full actual or reasonable processing costs.\n\n(6) Refunds of processing fees. (i) Processing fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.\n\n(ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the agency's final processing costs for the applications covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.\n\n(iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.\n\n(iv) For major category 5 and category 6 applications, an applicant whose application is denied or withdrawn in writing is responsible for costs incurred by the Forest Service in processing the application up to and including the date the agency denies the application or receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal. When an applicant withdraws a major category 5 or category 6 application, the applicant also is responsible for any costs subsequently incurred by the Forest Service in terminating consideration of the application.\n\n(7) Customer service standards. The Forest Service shall endeavor to make a decision on an application that falls into minor processing category 1, 2, 3, or 4, and that is subject to a categorical exclusion pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, within 60 calendar days from the date of receipt of the processing fee. If the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period, then prior to the 30th calendar day of the 60-day period, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reason why the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period and shall provide the applicant with a projected date when the agency plans to complete processing the application. For all other applications, including all applications that require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement, the authorized officer shall, within 60 calendar days of acceptance of the application, notify the applicant in writing of the anticipated steps that will be needed to process the application. These customer service standards do not apply to applications that are subject to a waiver of or exempt from cost recovery fees under §§ 251.58(f) or (g).\n\n(d) Monitoring fee requirements. The monitoring fee for an authorization shall be assessed independently of any fee charged for processing the application for that authorization pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of the monitoring fee is due upon issuance of the authorization.\n\n\n\n(1) Basis for monitoring fees. Monitoring is defined at § 251.51. For monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4, authorization holders are assessed fees based upon the estimated time needed for Forest Service monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Major category 5 and category 6 monitoring fees shall be based upon the agency's estimated costs to ensure compliance with the authorization during all phases of its term, including but not limited to monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Monitoring for all categories does not include billings, maintenance of case files, annual performance evaluations, or routine on-site reviews to determine compliance generally with the terms of an authorization.\n\n(2) Monitoring fee categories. No monitoring fee is charged for authorizations requiring 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to monitor. Authorizations requiring more than1 hour for the agency to monitor are covered by fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.\n\n(i) Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours. This minor category requires more than1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.\n\n(ii) Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours. This minor category requires more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.\n\n(iii) Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours. This minor category requires more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.\n\n(iv) Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours. This minor category requires more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.\n\n(v) Category 5: Master agreements. The Forest Service and the holder of an authorization may enter into a master agreement for the agency to recover monitoring costs associated with a particular authorization or by a group of authorizations for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with an authorization and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category authorization issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, a holder waives the right to request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:\n\n(A) The fee category or estimated monitoring costs;\n\n(B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing of monitoring fees;\n\n(C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;\n\n(D) A monitoring work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;\n\n(E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final monitoring costs; and\n\n(F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.\n\n(vi) Category 6: More than 50 hours. This major category requires more than 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization during all phases of its term, including, but not limited, to monitoring compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.\n\n(3) Billing and payment of monitoring fees. (i) The authorized officer shall estimate the monitoring costs and shall notify the holder of the required fee. Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued. For authorizations in major category 5 and category 6, the estimated monitoring fees must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued, unless the authorized officer and the applicant or holder agree in writing to periodic payments.\n\n(ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated monitoring costs are lower than the final monitoring costs for authorizations covered by a master agreement, the holder shall pay the difference between the estimated and final monitoring costs.\n\n(iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated monitoring fee is lower than the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the holder shall pay the difference in the next periodic payment or the authorized officer shall bill the holder for the difference between the estimated and full actual or reasonable monitoring costs. Payment shall be due within 30 days of receipt of the bill.\n\n(4) Refunds of monitoring fees. (i) Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.\n\n(ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the agency's final monitoring costs for the authorizations covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.\n\n(iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.\n\n(e) Applicant and holder disputes concerning processing or monitoring fee assessments; requests for changes in fee categories or estimated costs. (1) If an applicant or holder disagrees with the processing or monitoring fee category assigned by the authorized officer for a minor category or, in the case of a major processing or monitoring category, with the estimated dollar amount of the processing or monitoring costs, the applicant or holder may submit a written request before the disputed fee is due for substitution of an alternative fee category or alternative estimated costs to the immediate supervisor of the authorized officer who determined the fee category or estimated costs. The applicant or holder must provide documentation that supports the alternative fee category or estimated costs.\n\n(2) In the case of a disputed processing fee:\n\n(i) If the applicant pays the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall continue to process the application during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant requests that the processing cease.\n\n(ii) If the applicant fails to pay the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall suspend further processing of the application pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate processing fee and the applicant's payment of that fee.\n\n(3) In the case of a disputed monitoring fee:\n\n(i) If the applicant or holder pays the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall issue the authorization or allow the use and occupancy to continue during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant or holder elects not to exercise the authorized use and occupancy of National Forest System lands during the review period.\n\n(ii) If the applicant or holder fails to pay the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall not issue the applicant a new authorization or shall suspend the holder's existing authorization in whole or in part pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate monitoring fee and the applicant's or holder's payment of that fee.\n\n(4) The authorized officer's immediate supervisor shall render a decision on a disputed processing or monitoring fee within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written request from the applicant or holder. The supervisory officer's decision is the final level of administrative review. The dispute shall be decided in favor of the applicant or holder if the supervisory officer does not respond to the written request within 30 days of receipt.\n\n(f) Waivers of processing and monitoring fees. (1) All or part of a processing or monitoring fee may be waived, at the sole discretion of the authorized officer, when one or more of the following criteria are met:\n\n(i) The applicant or holder is a local, State, or Federal governmental entity that does not or would not charge processing or monitoring fees for comparable services the applicant or holder provides or would provide to the Forest Service;\n\n(ii) A major portion of the processing costs results from issues not related to the project being proposed;\n\n(iii) The application is for a project intended to prevent or mitigate damage to real property, or to mitigate hazards or dangers to public health and safety resulting from an act of God, an act of war, or negligence of the United States;\n\n(iv) The application is for a new authorization to relocate facilities or activities to comply with public health and safety or environmental laws and regulations that were not in effect at the time the authorization was issued;\n\n(v) The application is for a new authorization to relocate facilities or activities because the land is needed by a Federal agency or for a Federally funded project for an alternative public purpose; or\n\n(vi) The proposed facility, project, or use will provide, without user or customer charges, a valuable benefit to the general public or to the programs of the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n(2) An applicant's or holder's request for a full or partial waiver of a processing or monitoring fee must be in writing and must include an analysis that demonstrates how one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(vi) of this section apply.\n\n(g) Exemptions from processing or monitoring fees. No processing or monitoring fees shall be charged when the application or authorization is for a:\n\n(1) Noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51, or when the application or authorization is to exempt a noncommercial activity from a closure order, except for an application or authorization for access to non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Forest System granted pursuant to section 1323(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3210(a)).\n\n(2) Water systems authorized by section 501(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761(c)).\n\n(3) A use or activity conducted by a Federal agency that is not authorized under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761-1771); the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 185); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470h-2); or the Act of May 26, 2000 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6d).\n\n(4) Recreation special use as defined in the Forest Service's directive system and requires 50 hours or less for Forest Service personnel to process, except for situations involving multiple recreation special use applications provided for in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No monitoring fees shall be charged for a recreation special use authorization that requires 50 hours or less for Forest Service personnel to monitor.\n\n(h) Appeal of decisions. (1) A decision by the authorized officer to assess a processing or monitoring fee or to determine the fee category or estimated costs is not subject to administrative appeal.\n\n(2) A decision by an authorized officer's immediate supervisor in response to a request for substitution of an alternative fee category or alternative estimated costs likewise is not subject to administrative appeal.\n\n(i) Processing and monitoring fee schedules. (1) The Forest Service shall maintain schedules for processing and monitoring fees on its website. The rates in the schedules shall be updated annually by using the annual rate of change, second quarter to second quarter, in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) index. The Forest Service shall round the changes in the rates either up or down to the nearest dollar.\n\n(2) Within 5 years of the effective date of this rule, March 23, 2006, the Forest Service shall review these rates:\n\n(i) To determine whether they are commensurate with the actual costs incurred by the agency in conducting the processing and monitoring activities covered by this rule and\n\n(ii) To assess consistency with processing and monitoring fee schedules established by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management.\n\n[71 FR 8913, Feb. 21, 2006, as amended at 88 FR 84708, Dec. 6, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 251.60   Termination, revocation, and suspension.\n(a) Grounds for termination, revocation, and suspension—(1) Noncommercial group uses—(i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for a noncommercial group use only under one of the following circumstances:\n\n(A) Under the criteria for which an application for a special use authorization may be denied under § 251.54(g)(3)(ii);\n\n(B) For noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations or the terms and conditions of the authorization;\n\n(C) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges granted; or\n\n(D) With the consent of the holder.\n\n(ii) Judicial review. Revocation or suspension of a special use authorization under this paragraph constitutes final agency action, is not subject to administrative appeal, and is immediately subject to judicial review.\n\n(iii) Termination. A special use authorization for a noncommercial group use terminates when it expires by its own terms. Termination of a special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\n(2) All other special uses—(i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for all other special uses, except an easement issued under§ 251.53(j):\n\n(A) For noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the authorization;\n\n(B) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges granted;\n\n(C) With the consent of the holder; or\n\n(D) At the discretion of the authorized officer for specific and compelling reasons in the public interest. The Chief may revoke an easement issued under § 251.53(j) with the consent of the holder; by condemnation; or upon abandonment after a 5-year period of nonuse by the holder.\n\n(ii) Administrative review. Except for revocation or suspension of a permit or easement issued under § 251.53(e), revocation or suspension of an easement issued under § 251.53(l), and revocation for nonuse of an easement issued under § 251.53(j), revocation or suspension of a special use authorization under this paragraph is subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 214.\n\n(iii) Termination. For all special uses except noncommercial group uses, a special use authorization terminates when, by its terms, a fixed or agreed-upon condition, event, or time occurs. Termination of a special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section, the authorized officer is that person who issues the authorization or that officer's successor.\n\n(c) A special use authorization issued to a Federal agency under § 251.53(l) may be suspended or revoked only with the consent of the head of that Federal agency.\n\n(d) Except when immediate suspension pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is indicated, the authorized officer shall give the holder written notice of the grounds for suspension or revocation under paragraph (a) of this section and reasonable time to cure any noncompliance, prior to suspension or revocation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(e) Immediate suspension of a special use authorization, in whole or in part, may be required when the authorized officer deems it necessary to protect the public health or safety or the environment. In any such case, within 48 hours of a request of the holder, the superior of the authorized officer shall arrange for an on-site review of the adverse conditions with the holder. Following this review, the superior officer shall take prompt action to affirm, modify, or cancel the suspension.\n\n(f) Before suspension or revocation of permits and easements issued under § 251.53(e) and suspension or revocation of easements issued under § 251.53(l), a formal adjudicatory proceeding must be conducted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1, subpart H, as amended, and the authorized officer must determine, based on the proceeding, that grounds for revocation or suspension exist and that revocation or suspension is justified. Before revocation of easements issued under § 251.53(j) for nonuse, a formal adjudicatory proceeding must be conducted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1, subpart H, provided the holder requests the hearing within 60 days of receipt of the notice of revocation.\n\n(g) Upon revocation or termination of a special use authorization, the holder must remove within a reasonable time the structures and improvements and shall restore the site to a condition satisfactory to the authorized officer, unless the requirement to remove structures or improvements is otherwise waived in writing or in the authorization. If the holder fails to remove the structures or improvements within a reasonable period, as determined by the authorized officer, they shall become the property of the United States, but holder shall remain liable for the costs of removal and site restoration.\n\n[45 FR 38327, June 6, 1980; 45 FR 43167, June 26, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 28639, June 23, 1983; 60 FR 45295, Aug. 30, 1995; 63 FR 65968, Nov. 30, 1998; 74 FR 68381, Dec. 24, 2009; 75 FR 14995, Mar. 26, 2010; 75 FR 24802, May 6, 2010; 78 FR 33725, June 5, 2013; 88 FR 84709, Dec. 6, 2023]",

          "content": "§ 251.114   Criteria, terms and conditions.\n(a) In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant criteria. \n\n(b) Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of National Forest System lands in accordance with § 251.57 of this part. \n\n(c) A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of access to the United States across the landowner's property where such reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the difference in value will be paid to the landowner. If the value of the rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of-way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in § 251.57(b)(5) of this part. \n\n(d) For access across National Forest System lands that will have significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either a private road or as a public road, as determined to be appropriate by the authorizing officer. \n\n(e) When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway, the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and maintenance responsibility for the road assumed by the appropriate public road authority. \n\n(f) In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure that: \n\n(1) The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or routes of access available by deed or under State or common law; \n\n(2) The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and endangered species, and other values of the Federal land; \n\n(3) The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and; \n\n(4) When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success. \n\n(g) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non-federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: \n\n(1) The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal land used for similar purposes; \n\n(2) The combination of routes and modes of travel, including nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the non-federally owned land; \n\n(3) The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.",

A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization.\n\n(b) Any person who qualifies as a historical operator under this subpart and who wishes to exercise the rights granted to historical operators under section 1307(a) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(a)) must notify the authorized officer responsible for the CSU.\n\n(c) A historical operator may apply for a special use authorization to provide visitor services similar to but in lieu of those provided by that historical operator before January 1, 1979. The authorized officer shall grant the application if those visitor services are determined by the authorized officer to be:\n\n(1) Consistent with the purposes for which the applicable CSU was established or expanded;\n\n(2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and\n\n(3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.\n\n(d) Upon the authorized officer's determination that the person qualifies as a historical operator, under either paragraph (a) or paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall amend the current special use authorization or issue a new special use authorization to identify that portion of the authorized services that is deemed to be historical operations. The special use authorization shall identify the location, type, and frequency or volume of visitor services to be provided.\n\n(e) When a historical operator's special use authorization expires, the authorized officer shall offer to reissue the special use authorization for the same or similar visitor services, as long as the visitor services remain consistent with the purposes for which the CSU was established or expanded, the historical operator was lawfully and adequately providing visitor services under the previous special use authorization, and the historical operator continues to possess the capability to provide the visitor services adequately.\n\n(1) If the operator accepts the offer to reissue, the authorized officer shall issue a new special use authorization that clearly identifies the historical operations as required by paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(2) If the authorized officer determines that it is necessary to reduce the visitor services to be provided by a historical operator, the authorized officer shall modify the historical operator's special use authorization to reflect the reduced services as follows:\n\n(i) If more than one historical operator provides services in the area where visitor service capacity is to be reduced, the authorized officer shall apportion the reduction among the historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and such other factors as are relevant to achieve a proportionate reduction among the operators.\n\n(ii) If the reductions in visitor service capacity make it necessary to reduce operators in an area, the authorized officer shall select, through a competitive process that is limited to historical operators only, the operator or operators to receive a special use authorization from among the historical operators. Historical operators participating in this competitive process may not claim a preference as a preferred operator under § 251.124.\n\n(f) Any of the following shall result in the loss of historical operator status:\n\n(1) Revocation of a special use authorization for historical types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the special use authorization;\n\n(2) A historical operator's refusal of an offer to reissue a special use authorization made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;\n\n(3) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or otherwise, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; or\n\n(4) An operator's failure to provide the authorized services for a period of more than 24 consecutive months.\n\n(g) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals, who were personally engaged in the visitor service activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, shall not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized officer from authorizing persons other than historical operators to provide visitor services in the same area, as long as historical operators receive authorization to provide visitor services that are the same as or similar to those they provided on or before January 1, 1979.\n\n(i) If an authorized officer grants to a historical operator an increase in the scope or level of visitor services from what was provided on or before January 1, 1979, beyond what was authorized under paragraph (d) of this section, for either the same or similar visitor services, the historical operator has no right of preference for the increased amount of authorized services.

These rules also apply to other methods of acquisition, where indicated.\n\n(c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1621), or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions which do not conflict with the provisions of these Acts.\n\n(d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land exchanges for which the parties have agreed in writing to initiate prior to April 7, 1994, will proceed in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect at the time of the agreement.\n\n(e) Except for exchanges requiring cash equalization payments made available through the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as amended (16 U.S.C. 460[1]9), the boundaries of a national forest are automatically extended to encompass lands acquired under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), provided the acquired lands are contiguous to existing national forest boundaries and total no more than 3,000 acres in each exchange.\n\n(f) Exchanges under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, or the General Exchange Act of March 20, 1922, may involve land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber), or timber-for-land (the exchange of the rights to non-Federal timber for Federal land), or tripartite land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber cut by a third party in behalf of the exchange parties).\n\n(g) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are authorized by a number of statutes, depending upon the status (conditions of ownership) of such lands and the purpose for which an exchange is to be made. The status of National Forest System land is determined by the method by which the land or interests therein became part of the National Forest System.

          "content": "§ 254.3   Requirements.\n(a) Discretionary nature of exchanges. The Secretary is not required to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange proposal at any time during the exchange process.\n\n(b) Determination of public interest. The authorized officer may complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public interest will be well served.\n\n(1) Factors to consider. When considering the public interest, the authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to achieve better management of Federal lands and resources, to meet the needs of State and local residents and their economies, and to secure important objectives, including but not limited to: protection of fish and wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, and wilderness and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of communities; accommodation of existing or planned land use authorizations (§ 254.4(c)(4); promotion of multiple-use values; implementation of applicable Forest Land and Resource Management Plans; and fulfillment of public needs.\n\n(2) Findings. To determine that an exchange well serves the public interest, the authorized officer must find that—\n\n(i) The resource values and the public objectives served by the non-Federal lands or interests to be acquired must equal or exceed the resource values and the public objectives served by the Federal lands to be conveyed, and\n\n(ii) The intended use of the conveyed Federal land will not substantially conflict with established management objectives on adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust lands.\n\n(3) Documentation. The findings and the supporting rationale shall be documented and made part of the administrative record.\n\n(c) Equal value exchanges. Except as provided in § 254.11 of this subpart, lands or interests to be exchanged must be of equal value or equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in § 254.12 of this subpart. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through bargaining based on appraisal(s), through other acceptable and commonly recognized methods of determining market value, or through arbitration.\n\n(d) Same-State exchanges. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange must be located within the same State.\n\n(e) Congressional designations. Upon acceptance of title by the United States, lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by exchange under the authority granted by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, which are within the boundaries of any unit of the National Forest System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or any other system established by Act of Congress; or the boundaries of any national conservation area or national recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved for and become a part of the unit or area in which they are located, without further action by the Secretary of the Interior, and, thereafter, shall be managed in accordance with all laws, rules, regulations, and land resource management plans applicable to such unit or area.\n\n(f) Land and resource management planning. The authorized officer shall consider only those exchange proposals that are consistent with land and resource management plans (36 CFR part 219). Lands acquired by exchange that are located within areas having an administrative designation established through the land management planning process shall automatically become part of the area within which they are located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be managed in accordance with the laws, rules, regulations, and land and resource management plan applicable to such area.\n\n(g) Environmental analysis. After an agreement to initiate an exchange is signed, the authorized officer shall undertake an environmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and Forest Service environmental policies and procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). In making this analysis, the authorized officer shall consider timely written comments received in response to the exchange notice published pursuant to § 254.8 of this subpart.\n\n(h) Reservations or restrictions in the public interest. In any exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or shall otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and local governing bodies.\n\n(i) Hazardous substances—(1) Federal lands. The authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the Federal lands involved in the exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands in the contract agreement and in the conveyance document, pursuant to 40 CFR part 373 and 42 U.S.C. 9620. For purposes of this section, the notice of hazardous substances on involved Federal lands in an agreement to initiate an exchange or an exchange agreement meets the requirements for notices established in 40 CFR part 373. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a) and participated as an owner, or in the operation, arrangement, generation, or transportation of the hazardous substances found on the Federal land, the conveyance document from the United States must contain a covenant warranting that all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such substances remaining on the property has been taken before the date of transfer and that any additional remedial action found necessary after the transfer shall be conducted by the United States, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). The conveyance document must also reserve to the United States the right of access to the conveyed property if remedial or corrective action is required after the date of transfer. Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into an agreement as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e) whereby that party would indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless against any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.\n\n(2) Non-Federal lands. The non-Federal party shall notify the authorized officer of any hazardous substances known to have been released, stored, or disposed of on the non-Federal land, pursuant to § 254.4 of this subpart. Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the non-Federal land involved in an exchange. If hazardous substances are known or believed to be present on the non-Federal land, the authorized officer shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal party regarding the responsibility for appropriate response action concerning the hazardous substances before completing the exchange. The terms of this agreement and any appropriate “hold harmless agreement” shall be included in an exchange agreement, pursuant to § 254.14 of this subpart.\n\n(j) Legal description of properties. All lands subject to an exchange must be properly described on the basis of either a survey executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.\n\n(k) Special review. Except as provided in this paragraph, land acquisitions of $150,000 or more in value made under the authority of the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be submitted to Congress for oversight review, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). However, minor and insignificant changes in land acquisition proposals need not be resubmitted for congressional oversight, provided the general concept of and basis for the acquisition remain the same.",

If arbitration occurs, it must be conducted in accordance with the real estate valuation arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Secretary or an official to whom such authority has been delegated shall appoint an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association.\n\n(3) Within 30 days after completion of arbitration, the parties involved in the exchange must determine whether to proceed with the exchange, modify the exchange to reflect the findings of the arbitration or any other factors, or withdraw from the exchange. A decision to withdraw from the exchange may be made upon written notice by either party at this time or at any other time prior to entering into a binding exchange agreement. \n\n(4) If the parties agree to proceed with an exchange after arbitration, the values established by arbitration are binding upon all parties for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the arbitration decision. \n\n(b) Arbitration is limited to the disputed valuation of the lands involved in a proposed exchange and an arbitrator's award decision is limited to the value estimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An arbitrator may not include in an award decision recommendations regarding the terms of a proposed exchange, nor may an arbitrator's award decision infringe upon the authority of the Secretary to make all decisions regarding management of Federal lands and to make public interest determinations.",

(1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General Counsel, all conveyances to the United States must be prepared, executed, and acknowledged in accordance with the Department of Justice regulations and “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” in effect at the time of conveyance.\n\n(2) Conveyances of lands from the United States are made by patent, quitclaim deed, or deed and without express or implied warranties, except as to hazardous substances pursuant to § 254.3 of this subpart.\n\n(c) Title encumbrances—(1) Non-Federal lands. (i) Title to the non-Federal lands must be acceptable to the United States. For example, encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, mortgages, and other objections or title defects shall be eliminated, released, or waived in accordance with requirements of the preliminary title opinion of the USDA Office of the General Counsel or the Department of Justice, as appropriate.\n\n(ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR part 251, subpart A).\n\n(iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non-Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal property. If the personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of title or within the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed abandoned and shall become vested in the United States.\n\n(iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements for the relocation of any tenants.

If Federal lands proposed for exchange are occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease.

This suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire “improved property” without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If the property is made the subject of a variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standards contained in §§ 292.11 to 292.13; or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary. \n\n(c) Improved property as used in §§ 292.11 to 292.13, means any building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than three acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such “improved property” any shore or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public access thereto. \n\n(d) Sections 292.11 to 292.13 specify the standards with which local zoning ordinances for the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units must conform if the “improved property” or unimproved property proposed for development as authorized by the Act within the boundaries of the units is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 are to: \n\n(1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of that Act by means of use, acreage, setback, density, height or other requirements; and (3) provide that the Secretary receive notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the zoning ordinance approved by him. \n\n(e) Following promulgation of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 of final form, the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in effect at the time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment. \n\n(f) Any owner of unimproved property who proposes to develop his property for service to the public may submit to the Secretary a development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which it is proposed to be put. If the Secretary determines that the development and the use of the property conforms to approved zoning ordinances, and serves the purposes of the National Recreation Area and that the property is not needed for easements and rights-of-way for access, utilities, or facilities, or for administration sites, campgrounds, or other areas needed for use by the United States for visitors, he may in his discretion issue to such owner a certification that so long as the property is developed, maintained, and used in conformity with approved zoning ordinances the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended.",

Within 60 days following submission, the county will be notified of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto. If more than 60 days are required, the county will be notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain in effect as approved. \n\n(2) Development plans pertaining to unimproved property within the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the owner to the Secretary for determination as to whether they conform with approved zoning ordinances and whether the planned use and development would serve the Act. Within 30 days following submission of such plans the Secretary will approve or disapprove the plans or, if more than 30 days are required, will notify the applicant of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary. \n\n(b) Amendment of ordinances. Amendments of approved ordinances may be furnished in advance of their adoption to the Secretary for written decision as to their conformance with applicable standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13. \n\n(c) Variances or exceptions to application of ordinances. (1) The Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of a zoning ordinance or amendment thereto approved by him. \n\n(2) The County, or private owners of improved property, may submit to the Secretary proposed variances or exceptions to the application of an approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereto for written advice as to whether the intended use will make the property subject to acquisition without the owner's consent. Within 30 days following his receipt of such a request, the Secretary will advise the interested party or parties as to his determination. If more than 30 days are required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the interested party or parties stating the additional time required and the reasons therefore. \n\n(d) Certification of property. Where improvements and land use of improved property conform with approved ordinances, or with approved variances from such ordinances, certification that the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be obtained by any party in interest upon request to the Secretary. Where the development and use of unimproved property for service to the public is approved by the Secretary, certification that the authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be issued to the owner. \n\n(e) Effect of noncompliance. Suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire any improved property without the owner's consent will automatically cease if: (1) Such property is made the subject of variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standard in the Secretary's regulation, (2) such property is put to a use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance, or, as to property approved by the Secretary for development, a use which does not conform to the approved development plan or (3) the local zoning agency does not have in force a duly adopted, valid zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary in accordance with the standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13. \n\n(f) Nonconforming commercial or industrial uses. Any existing commercial or industrial uses not in conformance with approved zoning ordinances shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date such ordinances are approved: Provided, however, That with the approval of the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for a prescribed period sufficient to allow the owner reasonable additional time to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 1965.",

          "content": "§ 292.13   Standards.\n(a) The standards set forth in §§ 292.11-292.13 shall apply to the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units, which are defined by the boundary descriptions in the notice of the Secretary of Agriculture of July 12, 1966 (31 FR 9469), and to a strip of land outside the National Recreation Area on either side of Federal Aid Secondary Highway Numbered 1089, as more fully described in 2(a) of the act establishing the recreation area (79 Stat. 1296). \n\n(b) New industrial or commercial uses. New industrial or commercial uses will be prohibited in any location except under the following conditions: \n\n(1) The industrial use is such that its operation, physical structures, or waste byproducts would not have significant adverse impacts on surrounding or nearby outdoor recreation, scenic and esthetic values. Industrial uses having an adverse impact include, but are not limited to, cement production, gravel extraction operations involving more than one-fourth acre of surface, smelters, sand, gravel and aggregate processing plants, fabricating plants, pulpmills, and commercial livestock feeder yards. \n\n(2)(i) The commercial use is for purposes of providing food, lodging, automotive or marine maintenance facilities and services to accommodate recreationists and the intended land occupancy and physical structures are such that they can be harmonized with adjacent land development and surrounding appearances in accordance with approved plans and schedules. \n\n(ii) This standard provides for privately owned and operated businesses whose purposes and physical structures are in keeping with objectives for use and maintenance of the area's outdoor recreation resources. It precludes establishment of drive-in theaters, zoos, and similar nonconforming types of commercial entertainment. \n\n(c) Protection of roadsides. Provisions to protect natural scenic qualities and maintain screening along public travel routes will include: \n\n(1) Prohibition of new structural improvements or visible utility lines within a strip of land extending back not less than 150 feet from both sides of the centerline of any public road or roadway except roads within subdivisions or commercial areas. In addition to buildings, this prohibition pertains to above-ground power and telephone lines, borrow pits, gravel, or earth extraction areas, and quarries. \n\n(2) Retention of trees and shrubs in the above-prescribed roadside strips to the full extent that is compatible with needs for public safety and road maintenance. Wholesale clearing by chemical or other means for fire control and other purposes will not be practiced under this standard. \n\n(d) Protection of shorelines. Provisions to protect scenic qualities and reduce potentials for pollution of public reservoirs will include: Prohibition of structures within 300 feet horizontal distance from highwater lines of reservoirs other than structures the purpose of which is to service and accommodate boating or to facilitate picnicking and swimming: Provided, That exceptions to this standard may be made upon showing satisfactory to the Secretary that proposed structures will not conflict with scenic and antipollution considerations. \n\n(e) Property development. Location and development of structures will conform with the following minimum standards: \n\n(1) Commercial development. (i) Stores, restaurants, garages, service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of public land. \n\n(ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation area. \n\n(iii) Structures for commercial purposes, inclusive of isolated resorts or motels, will not exceed two stories height at front elevation, and will be conventional architecture and will utilize colors, nonglare roofing materials, and spacing or layout that harmonizes with forested settings. Except for signs, structures designed primarily for purposes of calling attention to products or service will not be permitted. \n\n(2) Residential development. (i) Locations approved for residential development will be buffered by distance, topography, or forest cover from existing or planned public use areas such as trailer parks, campgrounds, or organization sites. Separation will be sufficient to avoid conflicts resulting from intervisibility, noise, and proximity that is conducive to private property trespass. \n\n(ii) Requirements for approval of residential areas will include: (a) Construction of access when main access would otherwise be limited to a road constructed by the United States primarily to service publicly owned recreation developments; (b) limitation of residences to single-family units situated at a density not exceeding two per acre, but any lot of less than a half-acre may be used for residential purposes if, on or before promulgation of §§ 292.11-292.13, such lot was in separate ownership or was delineated in a county-approved plat that constitutes part of a duly recorded subdivision; (c) use of set-backs, limitations to natural terrain, neutral exterior colors, nonglare roofing materials, and limitations of building heights fully adequate to harmonize housing development with the objective of the National Recreation Area as set forth in the act. \n\n(3) Signs and signing. Only those signs may be permitted which: (i) Do not exceed 1 square foot in area for any residential use; (ii) do not exceed 40 square feet in area, 8 feet in length, and 15 feet maximum height from ground for any other use, including advertisement of the sale or rental of property; and (iii) which are not illuminated by any neon or flashing device. Commercial signs may be placed only on the property on which the advertised use occurs, or on the property which is advertised for sale or rental. Signs shall be subdued in appearance, harmonizing in design and color with the surroundings and shall not be attached to any tree or shrub. Nonconforming signs may continue for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date a zoning ordinance containing these limitations is adopted.",

          "content": "§ 292.15   General provisions—procedures.\n(a) Classification of private property. For the purpose of establishing specific standards applicable to the several parcels of private land within the boundaries, such properties are classified and assigned to land use categories as shown on the Land Use Category Map, dated December 15, 1973, as amended July 16, 1976, on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Area Ranger, Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Ketchum, Idaho. The classification of private properties is based on evaluation of scenic, natural, historic, pastoral, wildlife, and other values. \n\n(b) Land use categories. Land use categories shown on the map referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are: \n\n(1) Designated community. All properties inside a designated community. \n\n(2) Residential. Areas for residential development outside designated communities. \n\n(3) Commercial. Areas for commercial development outside designated communities. \n\n(4) Agriculture. All properties outside designated communities not placed in a residential or commercial land use category. \n\n(5) Mineral. Any areas in the land use in paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section, used for mineral operations. \n\n(c) Changes in classification. The Secretary may make changes in the classification of private lands set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by incorporating such changes in an amendment of these regulations. \n\n(d) Certification of compliance with standards—(1) Present use. Any owner of property may request in writing the Area Ranger to examine the present use of the property and issue a certification that such present use conforms to the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed. If after examination the Area Ranger determines that the present use of the property does so conform, he will issue a certification to this effect. \n\n(2) Planned development or change in use. Any owner of property who proposes to change the use or develop his property for other than agricultural use may submit to the Area Ranger a use or development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which the property is to be put. If the Area Ranger determines that the development and use plan conforms to the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed, he will issue a certification to this effect. \n\n(3) Notification of action. Within 45 days after receipt of request for certification, the Area Ranger shall: \n\n(i) Issue the certification. \n\n(ii) Notify applicant that additional information is needed before action can be taken on the application. \n\n(iii) Notify applicant that certification is denied, and reasons for denial. \n\n(iv) Notify applicant that action on the request is deferred for a specified period of time for stated reasons. \n\n(e) Qualified certifications. (1) Any owner of a property classified residential or commercial under paragraph (a) of this section which had been improved and was being used for residential or commercial purposes on the effective date of these regulations, but which does not conform to the standards established for properties in the land use category in which the property is placed may nevertheless be issued a certification for period not to exceed 10 years so that the improvements may be made to conform to the standards. Such certification shall specify that it is only effective so long as the property is not subdivided, and is not further improved and the improvements existing on the effective date of these regulations, are not reconstructed, altered or relocated, except to meet standards. The certification shall specify the date on which it shall terminate. \n\n(2) If the Area Ranger determines, prior to certification, that a part or all of a property, for which a request for certification is made, is needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities, he may except from the certification that part of the property needed for these purposes. \n\n(f) Revocation of certification. The Area Ranger will revoke a certification when he finds that the property is being used or developed not in conformance with the terms of the certification or the applicable standards established in § 292.16 or is in imminent danger of being so used or developed. Notice of such revocation will be in writing and delivered to the owner in person or by certified mail. A partial revocation may be made when a portion of a property covered by a certification is determined to be needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities. \n\n(g) Effect of certification. Property for which a certification is held by the owner shall not be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation. \n\n(h) Effect of noncompliance with standards. Property for which a determination has been made that it is being used or developed not in conformance with the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed may be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation. \n\n(i) Acquisition by negotiated purchase. (1) Any privately owned land or interest in land determined by the Secretary to be needed in furtherance of the objectives and purposes for which the Sawtooth National Recreation Area was established may be acquired by negotiated purchase subject only to the limitation in paragraph (j) of this section. \n\n(2) Property which has been developed for use prior to the effective date of these regulations, but which is not in conformance with applicable standards may be acquired by the Secretary through negotiated purchase and the Secretary may permit the owners, their successors or assigns to retain a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for a definite term not beyond December 31, 1988. \n\n(j) Limitation on acquisitions. Acquisitions of lands or interests therein for access to and utilization of public property and for recreation and other facilities shall not exceed 5 percent of the total acreage of all private property within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area on August 22, 1972. A land acquisition plan shall be prepared by the Area Ranger and approved by the Regional Forester showing those properties needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities. Said plan may be revised from time to time upon approval by the Regional Forester. Said plan shall be available for inspection by the public in the office of the Area Ranger. \n\n(k) Land exchanges. Some parcels of Federal lands within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area are classified or may be subsequently classified in the overall general plan for the Recreation Area as suitable for selection through land exchange. Using existing land exchange authorities, these Federal lands may be made available for selection by parties owning land within the boundaries of the National Recreation Area to resolve some existing or potential land use conflicts. The values of the properties so exchanged shall be approximately equal, or, if they are not approximately equal, they shall be equalized by the payment of cash. Federal lands which may be located within the boundaries of designated communities will be considered for exchange only after acceptable community development plans and ordinances have been implemented. \n\n(l) Appeals. Denial or revocation of a certification of compliance under this subpart is subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 214.\n\n(m) Judicial review. The United States District Court for the District of Idaho shall have jurisdiction to review these regulations upon a compliant filed within 6 months after the effective date of these regulations, by any affected landowner in an action for a declaratory judgment as provided in the Act of August 22, 1972 (86 Stat. 612), section 4(a).\n\n[39 FR 11544, Mar. 29, 1974, as amended at 41 FR 29379, July 16, 1976; 54 FR 3368, Jan. 23, 1989; 78 FR 33726, June 5, 2013]",

A proposed operating plan must be filed with the Area Ranger prior to conducting any operations and prior to construction, reconstruction, improvement or maintenance of roads and trails, bridges, or other facilities for access within the SNRA; provided, that an operating plan is not required for—\n\n(1) Operations which only involve vehicular travel on existing roads open to public use; \n\n(2) Marking and/or reestablishing claims corners; \n\n(3) Sampling and exploration work which will not cause significant damage to surface resources and will not involve the removal of more than 100 pounds of material for analysis and study, provided the Area Ranger has prior notice of such activities; or \n\n(4) The evaluation and study of existing underground mine workings not involving surface disturbances. \n\n(d) Operating plan—requirements. Each operating plan shall include: \n\n(1) The names and mailing addresses of operators and their agents, along with a statement of ownership and/or authorization under which the operation is to be conducted, and including a copy of the location notice(s), proof of assessment labor, and quit claim deeds if ownership has changed within the assessment year. \n\n(2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed. \n\n(3) Information describing the nature of operations proposed and how they will be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation to be used, the period during which the proposed operations will take place, and measures to be taken for protecting the values of the SNRA and reclaiming the lands. \n\n(e) Operating plan—approval. (1) The Area Ranger shall promptly acknowledge receipt of any operating plan to the operator. The Area Ranger shall review the environmental effects and conduct a technical examination of each proposed operating plan. \n\nThe technical examination shall identify the resources and the land uses in the area of operations. The Area Ranger shall use the current General Management Plan of the SNRA and the Final Environmental Statement as guides in determining whether the proposed operations may result in substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA. In his review, the Area Ranger may solicit comments from the general public and/or other government agencies in analysis of environmental effects. In his review, the Area Ranger will consider the compatibility of the proposed operating plan with the Act and the General Management Plan. The Area Ranger may not approve an operating plan for an identical claimed area to more than one operator. \n\n(2) Within 30 working days of receipt of a proposed operating plan, the Area Ranger shall take one of the following actions: \n\n(i) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as submitted; or, \n\n(ii) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as subject to the operator accepting the changes or conditions deemed necessary by the Area Ranger; or, \n\n(iii) Notify the operator that more time is necessary to review the plan because of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement, or conduct a cultural resource survey, or other stated reasons; in such cases, the operator will be notified of the approximate time needed to complete the review; or, \n\n(iv) Notify the operator of an apparent conflict of ownership and that additional proof of ownership is required; or, \n\n(v) Notify the operator that the operating plan as submitted is inadequate to support any conclusion as to substantial impairment, and that additional information will be required; or, \n\n(vi) Notify the operator that the operating plan is not approved since such operations as specified in the plan would create substantial impairment. \n\n(f) Operating plans—suspension, revocation, or modification. The authorized officer may suspend or revoke authorization to operate in whole or in part where such operations are causing substantial impairment which cannot be mitigated. At any time during operations under an approved operating plan, the operator may be required to modify the operating plan to minimize or avoid substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA.\n\n(g) Bond requirements. (1) An operator shall furnish a bond, in the amount determined by the Area Ranger to be appropriate for reclamation of the disturbed surface area, prior to the commencement of operations. In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, as directed by the Forest Service, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the time of deposit or not less than the required dollar amount of the bond. \n\n(2) When the reclamation of the project, or portions thereof, has been completed, the operator will notify the Area Ranger who will examine the area to determine whether the reclamation is acceptable. When the Area Ranger has accepted as completed any portion of the reclamation, he shall reduce proportionately the amount of bond thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation. However, the operator will not be released from liability under the bond for the amount which may be necessary to revegetate each planting area for a minimum period of at least 5 years after the first efforts at revegetation if those initial efforts are unsuccessful. \n\n(3) If the Area Ranger determines that revegetation is likely to occur before the expiration of such minimum period, he may release the operator from the extended liability under the bond for revegetation of planting area. \n\n(h) Access. The operator shall permit free and unrestricted public access to and through lands included within an unpatented mining claim for all lawful and proper purposes. In areas where such access would unduly interfere with authorized operations or would constitute a hazard to public health and safety, public use may be restricted with prior approval of the Area Ranger. \n\n[42 FR 39387, Aug. 4, 1977, as amended at 78 FR 33726, June 5, 2013]",

The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13) encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they existed at the time the HCNRA was established on December 31, 1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority granted by the Act.\n\n(b) Scope. The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's consent.\n\nThe regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements.",

However, the Regional Forester may authorize a road to be constructed or reconstructed in an area designated as Wild Land Recreation, Special Area of Historic or Tribal Significance, or Primitive if pursuant to statute, treaty, reserved or outstanding rights, or other legal duty of the United States.\n\n(b) Backcountry/Restoration. (1) Road construction and reconstruction are only permissible in Idaho Roadless Areas designated as Backcountry/Restoration where the Regional Forester determines:\n\n(i) A road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of an imminent threat of flood, wildland fire, or other catastrophic event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property;\n\n(ii) A road is needed to conduct a response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or to conduct a natural resource restoration action under CERCLA, section 311 of the Clean Water Act, or the Oil Pollution Act;\n\n(iii) A road is needed pursuant to statute, treaty, reserved or outstanding rights, or other legal duty of the United States;\n\n(iv) A road realignment is needed to prevent irreparable resource damage that arises from the design, location, use, or deterioration of a road and cannot be mitigated by road maintenance. Road realignment may occur under this subsection only if the road is deemed essential for public or private access, natural resource management, or public health and safety;\n\n(v) Road reconstruction is needed to implement a road safety improvement project on a road determined to be hazardous based on accident experience or accident potential on that road; or\n\n(vi) The Secretary of Agriculture determines that a Federal Aid Highway project, authorized pursuant to Title 23 of the United States Code, is in the public interest or is consistent with the purpose for which the land was reserved or acquired and no other reasonable and prudent alternative exists.\n\n(2) A responsible official may authorize temporary road construction or road reconstruction for community protection zone activities pursuant to § 294.24(c)(1)(i) if in the official's judgment the community protection objectives cannot be reasonably accomplished without a temporary road.\n\n(3) The Regional Forester may approve temporary road construction or road reconstruction to reduce hazardous fuel conditions outside a community protection zone where in the Regional Forester's judgment the circumstances set out below exist. Temporary road construction or road reconstruction to reduce hazardous fuel conditions under this provision will be dependent on forest type and is expected to be infrequent.\n\n(i) There is a significant risk that a wildland fire disturbance event could adversely affect an at-risk community or municipal water supply system pursuant to § 294.24(c)(1)(ii). A significant risk exists where the history of fire occurrence, and fire hazard and risk, indicate a serious likelihood that a wildland fire disturbance event would present a high risk of threat to an at-risk community or municipal water supply system.\n\n(ii) The activity cannot be reasonably accomplished without a temporary road.\n\n(iii) The activity will maintain or improve one or more roadless characteristics over the long-term.\n\n(c) General Forest, Rangeland, and Grassland. (1) A forest road may be constructed or reconstructed or a temporary road may be constructed in Idaho Roadless Areas designated as General Forest, Rangeland, and Grassland, unless prohibited in § 294.25(e).\n\n(2) Forest roads constructed or reconstructed pursuant to § 294.23(c)(1) must be conducted in a way that minimizes effects on surface resources and must be consistent with land management plan components as provided for in § 294.28(d).\n\n(d) Temporary roads. (1) Temporary road construction must be conducted in a way that minimizes effects on surface resources, is consistent with land management plan components as provided for in § 294.28(d), and may only be used for the specified purpose(s).\n\n(2) Temporary roads must be decommissioned upon completion of the project or expiration of the contract or permit, whichever is sooner. A road decommissioning provision will be required in all such contracts or permits and may not be waived.\n\n(e) Road maintenance. Maintenance of temporary and forest roads is permissible in Idaho Roadless Areas.\n\n(f) Roads associated with mineral activities.

The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado Roadless Area beyond that which was authorized by the terms and conditions of the lease at the time of issuance; or\n\n(ix) A temporary road is needed for coal exploration and/or coal-related surface activities for certain lands with Colorado Roadless Areas within the North Fork Coal Mining Area of the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests as defined by the North Fork Coal Mining Area displayed on the final Colorado Roadless Areas map. Such roads may also be used for collecting and transporting coal mine methane. Any buried infrastructure, including pipelines, needed for the capture, collection, and use of coal mine methane, will be located within the rights-of-way of temporary roads that are otherwise necessary for coal-related surface activities including the installation and operation of methane venting wells.\n\n(2) If proposed road construction/reconstruction meets one of the exceptions, subject to the legal rights identified in § 294.43(c)(1), the responsible official must determine:\n\n(i) Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;\n\n(ii) When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary road would not provide reasonable access;\n\n(iii) Road construction is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;\n\n(iv) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and\n\n(v) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.\n\n(d) Road construction/reconstruction/decommissioning project implementation and management. The following elements will be incorporated into any road construction/reconstruction projects implemented within Colorado Roadless Areas.\n\n(1) Road construction/reconstruction. If it is determined that a road is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, conduct construction in a manner that reduces effects on surface resources, and prevents unnecessary or unreasonable surface disturbance.\n\n(2) Road decommissioning. Decommission any road and restore the affected landscape when it is determined that the road is no longer needed for the established purpose prior to, or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, if possible; or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, whichever is sooner. Require the inclusion of a road decommissioning provision in all contracts or permits. Design decommissioning to stabilize, restore, and revegetate unneeded roads to a more natural state to protect resources and enhance roadless area characteristics. Examples include obliteration, denial of use, elimination of travelway functionality, and removal of the road prism (restoration of the road corridor to the original contour and hydrologic function).\n\n(3) Road designations. The designation of a temporary road constructed or reconstructed pursuant to this subpart may not be changed to forest road except where a forest road is allowed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.\n\n(4) Road use. Use of motor vehicles for administrative purposes by the Forest Service and by fire, emergency, or law enforcement personnel is allowed.

This subpart in no manner restricts any party from seeking modification of a pre-existing water court decree, but after July 3, 2012 any Forest Service authorization required for road construction, road reconstruction, tree cutting, or linear construction zones associated with a modified water court decree must conform to the requirements in this subpart; provided that road construction or reconstruction may be authorized where necessary to change the location of a headgate and associated ditch, pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute 2011 § 37-86-111.\n\n(b) Oil and Gas Leases. Oil and gas leases issued within a Colorado Roadless Area after July 3, 2012 will prohibit road construction/reconstruction. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado Roadless Area. For oil and gas leases issued in a Colorado Roadless Area prior to July 3, 2012, the rule preserves any existing leases and surface development rights. The rule also preserves any existing limitations on surface development rights arising from lease terms, lease stipulations, conditions of approval, 36 CFR 228.100, and Onshore Oil and Gas Orders.\n\n(c) Oil and Gas Leases on Upper Tier Acres. Oil and gas leases issued within upper tier acres after July 3, 2012 will require a no surface occupancy stipulation. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in surface occupancy within an upper tier area.\n\n(d) Oil and Gas Surface Use Plans of Operation. Where applicable and consistent with lease rights, during the review of any application for a surface use plan of operations affecting lands within a Colorado Roadless Area, the responsible official will:\n\n(1) Locate, without compromising health and safety standards, roads, well sites, and facilities on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Project design shall minimize the amount of necessary temporary road construction or reconstruction.\n\n(2) Consider an alternative for proposed operations that addresses locating directional drilling of multi-well sites on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Such an alternative can be dismissed from detailed analysis with clear justification.\n\n(3) Restrict road construction for leases partially within Colorado Roadless Areas to portions of the lease outside of Colorado Roadless Areas except when doing so will be substantially more environmentally damaging, compromise safety standards, or is unfeasible due to surface and/or operational conditions.\n\n(4) Perform reclamation of surface disturbances incrementally, to minimize the total area of disturbance at any given point in time during the exploration or development of a lease.\n\n(5) Design temporary roads and facilities to blend with the terrain to minimize visual impacts and to facilitate restoration when the road is no longer needed.\n\n(6) Co-locate, consistent with health and safety standards, power lines, flow lines and pipelines within the right-of-way of roads or other LCZs to minimize the area of surface disturbance.\n\n(7) Consider new and developing low impact techniques and technologies and either apply or dismiss with justification.\n\n(8) Consider the best available technology to minimize noise and air emissions.\n\n(e) Trails. Nothing in this subpart shall affect the current or future management of motorized and non-motorized trails in Colorado Roadless Areas. Decisions concerning the management or status of motorized and non-motorized trails within Colorado Roadless Areas under this subpart shall be made during the applicable forest travel management processes.\n\n(f) Motorized access. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as limiting the authority of the responsible official to approve existing and future motorized access not requiring road construction or reconstruction in Colorado Roadless Areas associated with grazing permits, special use authorizations, and other authorizations.\n\n(g) Livestock grazing. The authority to issue livestock grazing permits on national forest system lands within a Colorado Roadless Area is not affected by this subpart; however, no new temporary or forest roads shall be authorized through grazing permits issued after July 3, 2012.",

This category includes, in addition to internal matters of personnel administration, internal rules and practices which cannot be disclosed without prejudice to the effective performance of a Library function, such as guidelines and procedures used by auditors, investigators, or examiners in the Office of the Inspector General. \n\n(4) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute: \n\n(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or \n\n(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld. \n\n(5) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person as privileged or confidential. This exemption may include, but is not limited to, business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, scientific or manufacturing processes or development information. \n\n(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which could constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. This exemption includes all private or personal information contained in files compiled to evaluate candidates for security clearances. \n\n(7) Materials and information contained in investigative or other records compiled for law enforcement purposes. \n\n(8) Materials and information contained in files prepared in connection with government litigation and adjudicative proceedings, except for those portions of such files which are available by law to persons in litigation with the Library. \n\n(9) Records having information contained in or related to examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions. \n\n(10) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda, letters or other materials that are part of the deliberative process, the premature disclosure of which would inhibit internal communications or be detrimental to a Library function (e.g., case files in the Manuscript Division). \n\n(11) Records containing information customarily subject to protection as privileged in a court or other proceedings such as information protected by the doctor-patient, attorney work product, or attorney-client privilege. \n\n(12) Information submitted by a person to the Library in confidence or which the Library has obligated itself not to disclose such as information received by the Office of the Inspector General through its hotline. \n\n(13) Materials related to specific patron use of the Library's collections, resources, or facilities either on site or off site. This exemption includes: \n\n(i) Reader Records.

In making the initial determinations, the Chief shall consult with any unit in the Library having a continuing substantial interest in the record requested. Where the Chief finds no valid objection or doubt as to the propriety of making the requested record available, the Chief shall honor the request upon payment of prescribed fees, if any are required by § 703.8. \n\n(g) If the Chief, OSS, determines that a requested record should be withheld, the Chief shall inform the requester in writing that the request has been denied; shall identify the material withheld; and shall explain the basis for the denial. The Chief shall inform the requester that further consideration of the denied request may be obtained by a letter to the General Counsel setting out the basis for the belief that the denial of the request was unwarranted. \n\n(h) The General Counsel shall make the final determination on any request for reconsideration and shall notify the requester in writing of that determination. The decision of the General Counsel shall be the final administrative review within the Library. \n\n(1) If the General Counsel's decision reverses in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the Chief shall make the requested record, or parts thereof, available to the requester, subject to the provisions of § 703.8. \n\n(2) If the General Counsel's decision sustains in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the General Counsel shall explain the basis on which the record, or portions thereof, will not be made available.",

          "content": "§ 800.1   Purposes.\n(a) Purposes of the section 106 process. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. The procedures in this part define how Federal agencies meet these statutory responsibilities. The section 106 process seeks to accommodate historic preservation concerns with the needs of Federal undertakings through consultation among the agency official and other parties with an interest in the effects of the undertaking on historic properties, commencing at the early stages of project planning. The goal of consultation is to identify historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking, assess its effects and seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties. \n\n(b) Relation to other provisions of the act. Section 106 is related to other provisions of the act designed to further the national policy of historic preservation. References to those provisions are included in this part to identify circumstances where they may affect actions taken to meet section 106 requirements. Such provisions may have their own implementing regulations or guidelines and are not intended to be implemented by the procedures in this part except insofar as they relate to the section 106 process. Guidelines, policies, and procedures issued by other agencies, including the Secretary, have been cited in this part for ease of access and are not incorporated by reference. \n\n(c) Timing. The agency official must complete the section 106 process “prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license.” This does not prohibit agency official from conducting or authorizing nondestructive project planning activities before completing compliance with section 106, provided that such actions do not restrict the subsequent consideration of alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the undertaking's adverse effects on historic properties. The agency official shall ensure that the section 106 process is initiated early in the undertaking's planning, so that a broad range of alternatives may be considered during the planning process for the undertaking.",

          "content": "§ 800.2   Participants in the Section 106 process.\n(a) Agency official. It is the statutory obligation of the Federal agency to fulfill the requirements of section 106 and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over an undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for section 106 compliance in accordance with subpart B of this part. The agency official has approval authority for the undertaking and can commit the Federal agency to take appropriate action for a specific undertaking as a result of section 106 compliance. For the purposes of subpart C of this part, the agency official has the authority to commit the Federal agency to any obligation it may assume in the implementation of a program alternative. The agency official may be a State, local, or tribal government official who has been delegated legal responsibility for compliance with section 106 in accordance with Federal law. \n\n(1) Professional standards. Section 112(a)(1)(A) of the act requires each Federal agency responsible for the protection of historic resources, including archeological resources, to ensure that all actions taken by employees or contractors of the agency shall meet professional standards under regulations developed by the Secretary. \n\n(2) Lead Federal agency. If more than one Federal agency is involved in an undertaking, some or all the agencies may designate a lead Federal agency, which shall identify the appropriate official to serve as the agency official who shall act on their behalf, fulfilling their collective responsibilities under section 106. Those Federal agencies that do not designate a lead Federal agency remain individually responsible for their compliance with this part. \n\n(3) Use of contractors. Consistent with applicable conflict of interest laws, the agency official may use the services of applicants, consultants, or designees to prepare information, analyses and recommendations under this part. The agency official remains legally responsible for all required findings and determinations. If a document or study is prepared by a non-Federal party, the agency official is responsible for ensuring that its content meets applicable standards and guidelines. \n\n(4) Consultation. The agency official shall involve the consulting parties described in paragraph (c) of this section in findings and determinations made during the section 106 process. The agency official should plan consultations appropriate to the scale of the undertaking and the scope of Federal involvement and coordinated with other requirements of other statutes, as applicable, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and agency-specific legislation. The Council encourages the agency official to use to the extent possible existing agency procedures and mechanisms to fulfill the consultation requirements of this part. \n\n(b) Council. The Council issues regulations to implement section 106, provides guidance and advice on the application of the procedures in this part, and generally oversees the operation of the section 106 process. The Council also consults with and comments to agency officials on individual undertakings and programs that affect historic properties. \n\n(1) Council entry into the section 106 process. When the Council determines that its involvement is necessary to ensure that the purposes of section 106 and the act are met, the Council may enter the section 106 process. Criteria guiding Council decisions to enter the section 106 process are found in appendix A to this part. The Council will document that the criteria have been met and notify the parties to the section 106 process as required by this part. \n\n(2) Council assistance. Participants in the section 106 process may seek advice, guidance and assistance from the Council on the application of this part to specific undertakings, including the resolution of disagreements, whether or not the Council is formally involved in the review of the undertaking. If questions arise regarding the conduct of the section 106 process, participants are encouraged to obtain the Council's advice on completing the process. \n\n(c) Consulting parties. The following parties have consultative roles in the section 106 process. \n\n(1) State historic preservation officer. (i) The State historic preservation officer (SHPO) reflects the interests of the State and its citizens in the preservation of their cultural heritage. In accordance with section 101(b)(3) of the act, the SHPO advises and assists Federal agencies in carrying out their section 106 responsibilities and cooperates with such agencies, local governments and organizations and individuals to ensure that historic properties are taking into consideration at all levels of planning and development. \n\n(ii) If an Indian tribe has assumed the functions of the SHPO in the section 106 process for undertakings on tribal lands, the SHPO shall participate as a consulting party if the undertaking takes place on tribal lands but affects historic properties off tribal lands, if requested in accordance with § 800.3(c)(1), or if the Indian tribe agrees to include the SHPO pursuant to § 800.3(f)(3). \n\n(2) Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. (i) Consultation on tribal lands. (A) Tribal historic preservation officer. For a tribe that has assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act, the tribal historic preservation officer (THPO) appointed or designated in accordance with the act is the official representative for the purposes of section 106. The agency official shall consult with the THPO in lieu of the SHPO regarding undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on tribal lands. \n\n(B) Tribes that have not assumed SHPO functions. When an Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act, the agency official shall consult with a representative designated by such Indian tribe in addition to the SHPO regarding undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on its tribal lands. Such Indian tribes have the same rights of consultation and concurrence that the THPOs are given throughout subpart B of this part, except that such consultations shall be in addition to and on the same basis as consultation with the SHPO. \n\n(ii) Consultation on historic properties of significance to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the act requires the agency official to consult with any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking. This requirement applies regardless of the location of the historic property. Such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization shall be a consulting party. \n\n(A) The agency official shall ensure that consultation in the section 106 process provides the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic properties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties, including those of traditional religious and cultural importance, articulate its views on the undertaking's effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects. It is the responsibility of the agency official to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations that shall be consulted in the section 106 process. Consultation should commence early in the planning process, in order to identify and discuss relevant preservation issues and resolve concerns about the confidentiality of information on historic properties. \n\n(B) The Federal Government has a unique legal relationship with Indian tribes set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. Consultation with Indian tribes should be conducted in a sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Nothing in this part alters, amends, repeals, interprets, or modifies tribal sovereignty, any treaty rights, or other rights of an Indian tribe, or preempts, modifies, or limits the exercise of any such rights. \n\n(C) Consultation with an Indian tribe must recognize the government-to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. The agency official shall consult with representatives designated or identified by the tribal government or the governing body of a Native Hawaiian organization. Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations should be conducted in a manner sensitive to the concerns and needs of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. \n\n(D) When Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties off tribal lands, section 101(d)(6)(B) of the act requires Federal agencies to consult with such Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations in the section 106 process. Federal agencies should be aware that frequently historic properties of religious and cultural significance are located on ancestral, aboriginal, or ceded lands of Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations and should consider that when complying with the procedures in this part. \n\n(E) An Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization may enter into an agreement with an agency official that specifies how they will carry out responsibilities under this part, including concerns over the confidentiality of information. An agreement may cover all aspects of tribal participation in the section 106 process, provided that no modification may be made in the roles of other parties to the section 106 process without their consent. An agreement may grant the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization additional rights to participate or concur in agency decisions in the section 106 process beyond those specified in subpart B of this part. The agency official shall provide a copy of any such agreement to the Council and the appropriate SHPOs. \n\n(F) An Indian tribe that has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act may notify the agency official in writing that it is waiving its rights under § 800.6(c)(1) to execute a memorandum of agreement. \n\n(3) Representatives of local governments. A representative of a local government with jurisdiction over the area in which the effects of an undertaking may occur is entitled to participate as a consulting party. Under other provisions of Federal law, the local government may be authorized to act as the agency official for purposes of section 106. \n\n(4) Applicants for Federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals. An applicant for Federal assistance or for a Federal permit, license, or other approval is entitled to participate as a consulting party as defined in this part. The agency official may authorize an applicant or group of applicants to initiate consultation with the SHPO/THPO and others, but remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations charged to the agency official. The agency official shall notify the SHPO/THPO when an applicant or group of applicants is so authorized. A Federal agency may authorize all applicants in a specific program pursuant to this section by providing notice to all SHPO/THPOs. Federal agencies that provide authorizations to applicants remain responsible for their government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes. \n\n(5) Additional consulting parties. Certain individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in the undertaking may participate as consulting parties due to the nature of their legal or economic relation to the undertaking or affected properties, or their concern with the undertaking's effects on historic properties. \n\n(d) The public—(1) Nature of involvement. The views of the public are essential to informed Federal decisionmaking in the section 106 process. The agency official shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner that reflects the nature and complexity of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties, the likely interest of the public in the effects on historic properties, confidentiality concerns of private individuals and businesses, and the relationship of the Federal involvement to the undertaking. \n\n(2) Providing notice and information. The agency official must, except where appropriate to protect confidentiality concerns of affected parties, provide the public with information about an undertaking and its effects on historic properties and seek public comment and input. Members of the public may also provide views on their own initiative for the agency official to consider in decisionmaking. \n\n(3) Use of agency procedures. The agency official may use the agency's procedures for public involvement under the National Environmental Policy Act or other program requirements in lieu of public involvement requirements in subpart B of this part, if they provide adequate opportunities for public involvement consistent with this subpart.",

The agency official shall determine whether the proposed Federal action is an undertaking as defined in § 800.16(y) and, if so, whether it is a type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on historic properties. \n\n(1) No potential to cause effects. If the undertaking is a type of activity that does not have the potential to cause effects on historic properties, assuming such historic properties were present, the agency official has no further obligations under section 106 or this part. \n\n(2) Program alternatives. If the review of the undertaking is governed by a Federal agency program alternative established under § 800.14 or a programmatic agreement in existence before January 11, 2001, the agency official shall follow the program alternative. \n\n(b) Coordinate with other reviews. The agency official should coordinate the steps of the section 106 process, as appropriate, with the overall planning schedule for the undertaking and with any reviews required under other authorities such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and agency-specific legislation, such as section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act. Where consistent with the procedures in this subpart, the agency official may use information developed for other reviews under Federal, State, or tribal law to meet the requirements of section 106. \n\n(c) Identify the appropriate SHPO and/or THPO. As part of its initial planning, the agency official shall determine the appropriate SHPO or SHPOs to be involved in the section 106 process. The agency official shall also determine whether the undertaking may occur on or affect historic properties on any tribal lands and, if so, whether a THPO has assumed the duties of the SHPO. The agency official shall then initiate consultation with the appropriate officer or officers. \n\n(1) Tribal assumption of SHPO responsibilities. Where an Indian tribe has assumed the section 106 responsibilities of the SHPO on tribal lands pursuant to section 101(d)(2) of the act, consultation for undertakings occurring on tribal land or for effects on tribal land is with the THPO for the Indian tribe in lieu of the SHPO. Section 101(d)(2)(D)(iii) of the act authorizes owners of properties on tribal lands which are neither owned by a member of the tribe nor held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the tribe to request the SHPO to participate in the section 106 process in addition to the THPO. \n\n(2) Undertakings involving more than one State. If more than one State is involved in an undertaking, the involved SHPOs may agree to designate a lead SHPO to act on their behalf in the section 106 process, including taking actions that would conclude the section 106 process under this subpart. \n\n(3) Conducting consultation. The agency official should consult with the SHPO/THPO in a manner appropriate to the agency planning process for the undertaking and to the nature of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties. \n\n(4) Failure of the SHPO/THPO to respond. If the SHPO/THPO fails to respond within 30 days of receipt of a request for review of a finding or determination, the agency official may either proceed to the next step in the process based on the finding or determination or consult with the Council in lieu of the SHPO/THPO. If the SHPO/THPO re-enters the Section 106 process, the agency official shall continue the consultation without being required to reconsider previous findings or determinations. \n\n(d) Consultation on tribal lands. Where the Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO on tribal lands, consultation with the Indian tribe regarding undertakings occurring on such tribe's lands or effects on such tribal lands shall be in addition to and on the same basis as consultation with the SHPO. If the SHPO has withdrawn from the process, the agency official may complete the section 106 process with the Indian tribe and the Council, as appropriate. An Indian tribe may enter into an agreement with a SHPO or SHPOs specifying the SHPO's participation in the section 106 process for undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on tribal lands. \n\n(e) Plan to involve the public. In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall plan for involving the public in the section 106 process. The agency official shall identify the appropriate points for seeking public input and for notifying the public of proposed actions, consistent with § 800.2(d). \n\n(f) Identify other consulting parties. In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall identify any other parties entitled to be consulting parties and invite them to participate as such in the section 106 process. The agency official may invite others to participate as consulting parties as the section 106 process moves forward. \n\n(1) Involving local governments and applicants. The agency official shall invite any local governments or applicants that are entitled to be consulting parties under § 800.2(c). \n\n(2) Involving Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. The agency official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify any Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties in the area of potential effects and invite them to be consulting parties. Such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that requests in writing to be a consulting party shall be one. \n\n(3) Requests to be consulting parties. The agency official shall consider all written requests of individuals and organizations to participate as consulting parties and, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe upon whose tribal lands an undertaking occurs or affects historic properties, determine which should be consulting parties. \n\n(g) Expediting consultation. A consultation by the agency official with the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties may address multiple steps in §§ 800.3 through 800.6 where the agency official and the SHPO/THPO agree it is appropriate as long as the consulting parties and the public have an adequate opportunity to express their views as provided in § 800.2(d).",

          "content": "§ 800.4   Identification of historic properties.\n(a) Determine scope of identification efforts. In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall: \n\n(1) Determine and document the area of potential effects, as defined in § 800.16(d); \n\n(2) Review existing information on historic properties within the area of potential effects, including any data concerning possible historic properties not yet identified; \n\n(3) Seek information, as appropriate, from consulting parties, and other individuals and organizations likely to have knowledge of, or concerns with, historic properties in the area, and identify issues relating to the undertaking's potential effects on historic properties; and \n\n(4) Gather information from any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization identified pursuant to § 800.3(f) to assist in identifying properties, including those located off tribal lands, which may be of religious and cultural significance to them and may be eligible for the National Register, recognizing that an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization may be reluctant to divulge specific information regarding the location, nature, and activities associated with such sites. The agency official should address concerns raised about confidentiality pursuant to § 800.11(c). \n\n(b) Identify historic properties. Based on the information gathered under paragraph (a) of this section, and in consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to properties within the area of potential effects, the agency official shall take the steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects. \n\n(1) Level of effort. The agency official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts, which may include background research, consultation, oral history interviews, sample field investigation, and field survey. The agency official shall take into account past planning, research and studies, the magnitude and nature of the undertaking and the degree of Federal involvement, the nature and extent of potential effects on historic properties, and the likely nature and location of historic properties within the area of potential effects. The Secretary's standards and guidelines for identification provide guidance on this subject. The agency official should also consider other applicable professional, State, tribal, and local laws, standards, and guidelines. The agency official shall take into account any confidentiality concerns raised by Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations during the identification process. \n\n(2) Phased identification and evaluation. Where alternatives under consideration consist of corridors or large land areas, or where access to properties is restricted, the agency official may use a phased process to conduct identification and evaluation efforts. The agency official may also defer final identification and evaluation of historic properties if it is specifically provided for in a memorandum of agreement executed pursuant to § 800.6, a programmatic agreement executed pursuant to § 800.14(b), or the documents used by an agency official to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act pursuant to § 800.8. The process should establish the likely presence of historic properties within the area of potential effects for each alternative or inaccessible area through background research, consultation and an appropriate level of field investigation, taking into account the number of alternatives under consideration, the magnitude of the undertaking and its likely effects, and the views of the SHPO/THPO and any other consulting parties. As specific aspects or locations of an alternative are refined or access is gained, the agency official shall proceed with the identification and evaluation of historic properties in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section. \n\n(c) Evaluate historic significance—(1) Apply National Register criteria. In consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to identified properties and guided by the Secretary's standards and guidelines for evaluation, the agency official shall apply the National Register criteria (36 CFR part 63) to properties identified within the area of potential effects that have not been previously evaluated for National Register eligibility. The passage of time, changing perceptions of significance, or incomplete prior evaluations may require the agency official to reevaluate properties previously determined eligible or ineligible. The agency official shall acknowledge that Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations possess special expertise in assessing the eligibility of historic properties that may possess religious and cultural significance to them. \n\n(2) Determine whether a property is eligible. If the agency official determines any of the National Register criteria are met and the SHPO/THPO agrees, the property shall be considered eligible for the National Register for section 106 purposes. If the agency official determines the criteria are not met and the SHPO/THPO agrees, the property shall be considered not eligible. If the agency official and the SHPO/THPO do not agree, or if the Council or the Secretary so request, the agency official shall obtain a determination of eligibility from the Secretary pursuant to 36 CFR part 63. If an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to a property off tribal lands does not agree, it may ask the Council to request the agency official to obtain a determination of eligibility. \n\n(d) Results of identification and evaluation—(1) No historic properties affected. If the agency official finds that either there are no historic properties present or there are historic properties present but the undertaking will have no effect upon them as defined in § 800.16(i), the agency official shall provide documentation of this finding, as set forth in § 800.11(d), to the SHPO/THPO. The agency official shall notify all consulting parties, including Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, and make the documentation available for public inspection prior to approving the undertaking.\n\n(i) If the SHPO/THPO, or the Council if it has entered the section 106 process, does not object within 30 days of receipt of an adequately documented finding, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.\n\n(ii) If the SHPO/THPO objects within 30 days of receipt of an adequately documented finding, the agency official shall either consult with the objecting party to resolve the disagreement, or forward the finding and supporting documentation to the Council and request that the Council review the finding pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) through (d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section. When an agency official forwards such requests for review to the Council, the agency official shall concurrently notify all consulting parties that such a request has been made and make the request documentation available to the public.\n\n(iii) During the SHPO/THPO 30 day review period, the Council may object to the finding and provide its opinion regarding the finding to the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The agency shall then proceed according to paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(B) and (d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.\n\n(iv) (A) Upon receipt of the request under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Council will have 30 days in which to review the finding and provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with the Council's opinion regarding the finding. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. If the Council does not respond within 30 days of receipt of the request, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.\n\n(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion before the agency reaches a final decision on the finding.\n\n(C) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall then prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior policy official. If the agency official's initial finding will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised finding. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial agency finding of no historic properties affected, once the summary of the decision has been sent to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.\n\n(D) The Council shall retain a record of agency responses to Council opinions on their findings of no historic properties affected. The Council shall make this information available to the public.\n\n(2) Historic properties affected. If the agency official finds that there are historic properties which may be affected by the undertaking, the agency official shall notify all consulting parties, including Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, invite their views on the effects and assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with § 800.5.\n\n[65 FR 77725, Dec. 12, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 40553, July 6, 2004]",

In consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to identified historic properties, the agency official shall apply the criteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the area of potential effects. The agency official shall consider any views concerning such effects which have been provided by consulting parties and the public. \n\n(1) Criteria of adverse effect. An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying characteristics of a historic property, including those that may have been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the property's eligibility for the National Register. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance or be cumulative. \n\n(2) Examples of adverse effects. Adverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to: \n\n(i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property; \n\n(ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines; \n\n(iii) Removal of the property from its historic location; \n\n(iv) Change of the character of the property's use or of physical features within the property's setting that contribute to its historic significance; \n\n(v) Introduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property's significant historic features; \n\n(vi) Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization; and \n\n(vii) Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of Federal ownership or control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property's historic significance. \n\n(3) Phased application of criteria. Where alternatives under consideration consist of corridors or large land areas, or where access to properties is restricted, the agency official may use a phased process in applying the criteria of adverse effect consistent with phased identification and evaluation efforts conducted pursuant to § 800.4(b)(2). \n\n(b) Finding of no adverse effect. The agency official, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO, may propose a finding of no adverse effect when the undertaking's effects do not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the undertaking is modified or conditions are imposed, such as the subsequent review of plans for rehabilitation by the SHPO/THPO to ensure consistency with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines, to avoid adverse effects. \n\n(c) Consulting party review. If the agency official proposes a finding of no adverse effect, the agency official shall notify all consulting parties of the finding and provide them with the documentation specified in § 800.11(e). The SHPO/THPO shall have 30 days from receipt to review the finding. \n\n(1) Agreement with, or no objection to, finding. Unless the Council is reviewing the finding pursuant to papagraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency official may proceed after the close of the 30 day review period if the SHPO/THPO has agreed with the finding or has not provided a response, and no consulting party has objected. The agency official shall then carry out the undertaking in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.\n\n(2) Disagreement with finding. (i) If within the 30 day review period the SHPO/THPO or any consulting party notifies the agency official in writing that it disagrees with the finding and specifies the reasons for the disagreement in the notification, the agency official shall either consult with the party to resolve the disagreement, or request the Council to review the finding pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The agency official shall include with such request the documentation specified in § 800.11(e). The agency official shall also concurrently notify all consulting parties that such a submission has been made and make the submission documentation available to the public.\n\n(ii) If within the 30 day review period the Council provides the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency, with a written opinion objecting to the finding, the agency shall then proceed according to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part.\n\n(iii) The agency official should seek the concurrence of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that has made known to the agency official that it attaches religious and cultural significance to a historic property subject to the finding. If such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization disagrees with the finding, it may within the 30 day review period specify the reasons for disagreeing with the finding and request the Council to review and object to the finding pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.\n\n(3) Council review of findings. (i) When a finding is submitted to the Council pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the Council shall review the finding and provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with its opinion as to whether the adverse effect criteria have been correctly applied. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The Council will provide its opinion within 15 days of receiving the documented finding from the agency official. The Council at its discretion may extend that time period for 15 days, in which case it shall notify the agency of such extension prior to the end of the initial 15 day period. If the Council does not respond within the applicable time period, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.\n\n(ii)(A) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion in reaching a final decision on the finding.\n\n(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior policy official. If the agency official's initial finding will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised finding. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial finding of no adverse effect, once the summary of the decision has been sent to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.\n\n(C) The Council shall retain a record of agency responses to Council opinions on their findings of no adverse effects. The Council shall make this information available to the public.\n\n(d) Results of assessment—(1) No adverse effect. The agency official shall maintain a record of the finding and provide information on the finding to the public on request, consistent with the confidentiality provisions of § 800.11(c). Implementation of the undertaking in accordance with the finding as documented fulfills the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and this part. If the agency official will not conduct the undertaking as proposed in the finding, the agency official shall reopen consultation under paragraph (a) of this section. \n\n(2) Adverse effect. If an adverse effect is found, the agency official shall consult further to resolve the adverse effect pursuant to § 800.6. \n\n[65 FR 77725, Dec. 12, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 40553, July 6, 2004]",

In addition to the consulting parties identified under § 800.3(f), the agency official, the SHPO/THPO and the Council, if participating, may agree to invite other individuals or organizations to become consulting parties. The agency official shall invite any individual or organization that will assume a specific role or responsibility in a memorandum of agreement to participate as a consulting party. \n\n(3) Provide documentation. The agency official shall provide to all consulting parties the documentation specified in § 800.11(e), subject to the confidentiality provisions of § 800.11(c), and such other documentation as may be developed during the consultation to resolve adverse effects. \n\n(4) Involve the public. The agency official shall make information available to the public, including the documentation specified in § 800.11(e), subject to the confidentiality provisions of § 800.11(c). The agency official shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to express their views on resolving adverse effects of the undertaking. The agency official should use appropriate mechanisms, taking into account the magnitude of the undertaking and the nature of its effects upon historic properties, the likely effects on historic properties, and the relationship of the Federal involvement to the undertaking to ensure that the public's views are considered in the consultation. The agency official should also consider the extent of notice and information concerning historic preservation issues afforded the public at earlier steps in the section 106 process to determine the appropriate level of public involvement when resolving adverse effects so that the standards of § 800.2(d) are met. \n\n(5) Restrictions on disclosure of information. Section 304 of the act and other authorities may limit the disclosure of information under paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section. If an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization objects to the disclosure of information or if the agency official believes that there are other reasons to withhold information, the agency official shall comply with § 800.11(c) regarding the disclosure of such information. \n\n(b) Resolve adverse effects—(1) Resolution without the Council. (i) The agency official shall consult with the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties to seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate the adverse effects. \n\n(ii) The agency official may use standard treatments established by the Council under § 800.14(d) as a basis for a memorandum of agreement. \n\n(iii) If the Council decides to join the consultation, the agency official shall follow paragraph (b)(2) of this section. \n\n(iv) If the agency official and the SHPO/THPO agree on how the adverse effects will be resolved, they shall execute a memorandum of agreement.

If the Council decides not to join the consultation, the Council will notify the agency and proceed to comment in accordance with § 800.7(c). \n\n(2) Resolution with Council participation. If the Council decides to participate in the consultation, the agency official shall consult with the SHPO/THPO, the Council, and other consulting parties, including Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations under § 800.2(c)(3), to seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate the adverse effects. If the agency official, the SHPO/THPO, and the Council agree on how the adverse effects will be resolved, they shall execute a memorandum of agreement. \n\n(c) Memorandum of agreement. A memorandum of agreement executed and implemented pursuant to this section evidences the agency official's compliance with section 106 and this part and shall govern the undertaking and all of its parts.

The head of the agency shall take into account the Council's comments in reaching a final decision on the undertaking. Section 110(l) of the act directs that the head of the agency shall document this decision and may not delegate his or her responsibilities pursuant to section 106. Documenting the agency head's decision shall include: \n\n(i) Preparing a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's comments and providing it to the Council prior to approval of the undertaking; \n\n(ii) Providing a copy of the summary to all consulting parties; and \n\n(iii) Notifying the public and making the record available for public inspection.",

          "content": "§ 800.8   Coordination With the National Environmental Policy Act.\n(a) General principles—(1) Early coordination. Federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate compliance with section 106 and the procedures in this part with any steps taken to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Agencies should consider their section 106 responsibilities as early as possible in the NEPA process, and plan their public participation, analysis, and review in such a way that they can meet the purposes and requirements of both statutes in a timely and efficient manner. The determination of whether an undertaking is a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,” and therefore requires preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) under NEPA, should include consideration of the undertaking's likely effects on historic properties. A finding of adverse effect on a historic property does not necessarily require an EIS under NEPA. \n\n(2) Consulting party roles. SHPO/THPOs, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations, other consulting parties, and organizations and individuals who may be concerned with the possible effects of an agency action on historic properties should be prepared to consult with agencies early in the NEPA process, when the purpose of and need for the proposed action as well as the widest possible range of alternatives are under consideration. \n\n(3) Inclusion of historic preservation issues. Agency officials should ensure that preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) or an EIS and record of decision (ROD) includes appropriate scoping, identification of historic properties, assessment of effects upon them, and consultation leading to resolution of any adverse effects. \n\n(b) Actions categorically excluded under NEPA. If a project, activity or program is categorically excluded from NEPA review under an agency's NEPA procedures, the agency official shall determine if it still qualifies as an undertaking requiring review under section 106 pursuant to § 800.3(a). If so, the agency official shall proceed with section 106 review in accordance with the procedures in this subpart. \n\n(c) Use of the NEPA process for section 106 purposes. An agency official may use the process and documentation required for the preparation of an EA/FONSI or an EIS/ROD to comply with section 106 in lieu of the procedures set forth in §§ 800.3 through 800.6 if the agency official has notified in advance the SHPO/THPO and the Council that it intends to do so and the following standards are met. \n\n(1) Standards for developing environmental documents to comply with Section 106. During preparation of the EA or draft EIS (DEIS) the agency official shall: \n\n(i) Identify consulting parties either pursuant to § 800.3(f) or through the NEPA scoping process with results consistent with § 800.3(f); \n\n(ii) Identify historic properties and assess the effects of the undertaking on such properties in a manner consistent with the standards and criteria of §§ 800.4 through 800.5, provided that the scope and timing of these steps may be phased to reflect the agency official's consideration of project alternatives in the NEPA process and the effort is commensurate with the assessment of other environmental factors; \n\n(iii) Consult regarding the effects of the undertaking on historic properties with the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to affected historic properties, other consulting parties, and the Council, where appropriate, during NEPA scoping, environmental analysis, and the preparation of NEPA documents; \n\n(iv) Involve the public in accordance with the agency's published NEPA procedures; and (v) Develop in consultation with identified consulting parties alternatives and proposed measures that might avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of the undertaking on historic properties and describe them in the EA or DEIS. \n\n(2) Review of environmental documents. (i) The agency official shall submit the EA, DEIS, or EIS to the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to affected historic properties, and other consulting parties prior to or when making the document available for public comment. If the document being prepared is a DEIS or EIS, the agency official shall also submit it to the Council. \n\n(ii) Prior to or within the time allowed for public comment on the document, a SHPO/THPO, an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, another consulting party or the Council may object to the agency official that preparation of the EA, DEIS, or EIS has not met the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that the substantive resolution of the effects on historic properties proposed in an EA, DEIS, or EIS is inadequate. If the agency official receives such an objection, the agency official shall refer the matter to the Council. \n\n(3) Resolution of objections. Within 30 days of the agency official's referral of an objection under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Council shall review the objection and notify the agency as to its opinion on the objection.\n\n(i) If the Council agrees with the objection:\n\n(A) The Council shall provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with the Council's opinion regarding the objection. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion in reaching a final decision on the issue of the objection.\n\n(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior Policy Official. If the agency official's initial decision regarding the matter that is the subject of the objection will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised decision. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial agency decision, once the summary of the final decision has been sent to the Council, the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.\n\n(ii) If the Council disagrees with the objection, the Council shall so notify the agency official, in which case the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.\n\n(iii) If the Council fails to respond to the objection within the 30 day period, the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.\n\n(4) Approval of the undertaking. If the agency official has found, during the preparation of an EA or EIS that the effects of an undertaking on historic properties are adverse, the agency official shall develop measures in the EA, DEIS, or EIS to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such effects in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. The agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and the procedures in this subpart shall then be satisfied when either: \n\n(i) A binding commitment to such proposed measures is incorporated in: \n\n(A) The ROD, if such measures were proposed in a DEIS or EIS; or \n\n(B) An MOA drafted in compliance with § 800.6(c); or \n\n(ii) The Council has commented under § 800.7 and received the agency's response to such comments. \n\n(5) Modification of the undertaking. If the undertaking is modified after approval of the FONSI or the ROD in a manner that changes the undertaking or alters its effects on historic properties, or if the agency official fails to ensure that the measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects (as specified in either the FONSI or the ROD, or in the binding commitment adopted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section) are carried out, the agency official shall notify the Council and all consulting parties that supplemental environmental documents will be prepared in compliance with NEPA or that the procedures in §§ 800.3 through 800.6 will be followed as necessary. \n\n[65 FR 77725, Dec. 12, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 40554, July 6, 2004]",

          "content": "§ 800.9   Council review of section 106 compliance.\n(a) Assessment of agency official compliance for individual undertakings. The Council may provide to the agency official its advisory opinion regarding the substance of any finding, determination or decision or regarding the adequacy of the agency official's compliance with the procedures under this part. The Council may provide such advice at any time at the request of any individual, agency or organization or on its own initiative. The agency official shall consider the views of the Council in reaching a decision on the matter in question. \n\n(b) Agency foreclosure of the Council's opportunity to comment. Where an agency official has failed to complete the requirements of section 106 in accordance with the procedures in this part prior to the approval of an undertaking, the Council's opportunity to comment may be foreclosed. The Council may review a case to determine whether a foreclosure has occurred. The Council shall notify the agency official and the agency's Federal preservation officer and allow 30 days for the agency official to provide information as to whether foreclosure has occurred. If the Council determines foreclosure has occurred, the Council shall transmit the determination to the agency official and the head of the agency. The Council shall also make the determination available to the public and any parties known to be interested in the undertaking and its effects upon historic properties. \n\n(c) Intentional adverse effects by applicants—(1) Agency responsibility. Section 110(k) of the act prohibits a Federal agency from granting a loan, loan guarantee, permit, license or other assistance to an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of section 106, has intentionally significantly adversely affected a historic property to which the grant would relate, or having legal power to prevent it, has allowed such significant adverse effect to occur, unless the agency, after consultation with the Council, determines that circumstances justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect created or permitted by the applicant. Guidance issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 110 of the act governs its implementation. \n\n(2) Consultation with the Council. When an agency official determines, based on the actions of an applicant, that section 110(k) is applicable and that circumstances may justify granting the assistance, the agency official shall notify the Council and provide documentation specifying the circumstances under which the adverse effects to the historic property occurred and the degree of damage to the integrity of the property. This documentation shall include any views obtained from the applicant, SHPO/THPO, an Indian tribe if the undertaking occurs on or affects historic properties on tribal lands, and other parties known to be interested in the undertaking. \n\n(i) Within thirty days of receiving the agency official's notification, unless otherwise agreed to by the agency official, the Council shall provide the agency official with its opinion as to whether circumstances justify granting assistance to the applicant and any possible mitigation of the adverse effects. \n\n(ii) The agency official shall consider the Council's opinion in making a decision on whether to grant assistance to the applicant, and shall notify the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and other parties known to be interested in the undertaking prior to granting the assistance. \n\n(3) Compliance with Section 106. If an agency official, after consulting with the Council, determines to grant the assistance, the agency official shall comply with §§ 800.3 through 800.6 to take into account the effects of the undertaking on any historic properties. \n\n(d) Evaluation of Section 106 operations. The Council may evaluate the operation of the section 106 process by periodic reviews of how participants have fulfilled their legal responsibilities and how effectively the outcomes reached advance the purposes of the act. \n\n(1) Information from participants. Section 203 of the act authorizes the Council to obtain information from Federal agencies necessary to conduct evaluation of the section 106 process. The agency official shall make documentation of agency policies, operating procedures and actions taken to comply with section 106 available to the Council upon request. The Council may request available information and documentation from other participants in the section 106 process. \n\n(2) Improving the operation of section 106. Based upon any evaluation of the section 106 process, the Council may make recommendations to participants, the heads of Federal agencies, and the Secretary of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. Where the Council determines that an agency official or a SHPO/THPO has failed to properly carry out the responsibilities assigned under the process in this part, the Council may participate in individual case reviews conducted under such process in addition to the SHPO/THPO for such period that it determines is necessary to improve performance or correct deficiencies. If the Council finds a pattern of failure by a Federal agency in carrying out its responsibilities under section 106, the Council may review the policies and programs of the agency related to historic preservation pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the act and recommend methods to improve the effectiveness, coordination, and consistency of those policies and programs with section 106.",

The agency official shall notify the Secretary of any consultation involving a National Historic Landmark and invite the Secretary to participate in the consultation where there may be an adverse effect. The Council may request a report from the Secretary under section 213 of the act to assist in the consultation. \n\n(d) Report of outcome.

The agency official shall ensure that a determination, finding, or agreement under the procedures in this subpart is supported by sufficient documentation to enable any reviewing parties to understand its basis. The agency official shall provide such documentation to the extent permitted by law and within available funds. When an agency official is conducting phased identification or evaluation under this subpart, the documentation standards regarding description of historic properties may be applied flexibly. If the Council, or the SHPO/THPO when the Council is not involved, determines the applicable documentation standards are not met, the Council or the SHPO/THPO, as appropriate, shall notify the agency official and specify the information needed to meet the standard. At the request of the agency official or any of the consulting parties, the Council shall review any disputes over whether documentation standards are met and provide its views to the agency official and the consulting parties. \n\n(b) Format. The agency official may use documentation prepared to comply with other laws to fulfill the requirements of the procedures in this subpart, if that documentation meets the standards of this section. \n\n(c) Confidentiality—(1) Authority to withhold information. Section 304 of the act provides that the head of a Federal agency or other public official receiving grant assistance pursuant to the act, after consultation with the Secretary, shall withhold from public disclosure information about the location, character, or ownership of a historic property when disclosure may cause a significant invasion of privacy; risk harm to the historic property; or impede the use of a traditional religious site by practitioners. When the head of a Federal agency or other public official has determined that information should be withheld from the public pursuant to these criteria, the Secretary, in consultation with such Federal agency head or official, shall determine who may have access to the information for the purposes of carrying out the act. \n\n(2) Consultation with the Council. When the information in question has been developed in the course of an agency's compliance with this part, the Secretary shall consult with the Council in reaching determinations on the withholding and release of information. The Federal agency shall provide the Council with available information, including views of the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, related to the confidentiality concern. The Council shall advise the Secretary and the Federal agency within 30 days of receipt of adequate documentation. \n\n(3) Other authorities affecting confidentiality. Other Federal laws and program requirements may limit public access to information concerning an undertaking and its effects on historic properties. Where applicable, those authorities shall govern public access to information developed in the section 106 process and may authorize the agency official to protect the privacy of non-governmental applicants. \n\n(d) Finding of no historic properties affected. Documentation shall include: \n\n(1) A description of the undertaking, specifying the Federal involvement, and its area of potential effects, including photographs, maps, drawings, as necessary; \n\n(2) A description of the steps taken to identify historic properties, including, as appropriate, efforts to seek information pursuant to § 800.4(b); and\n\n(3) The basis for determining that no historic properties are present or affected. \n\n(e) Finding of no adverse effect or adverse effect. Documentation shall include: \n\n(1) A description of the undertaking, specifying the Federal involvement, and its area of potential effects, including photographs, maps, and drawings, as necessary; \n\n(2) A description of the steps taken to identify historic properties; \n\n(3) A description of the affected historic properties, including information on the characteristics that qualify them for the National Register; \n\n(4) A description of the undertaking's effects on historic properties; \n\n(5) An explanation of why the criteria of adverse effect were found applicable or inapplicable, including any conditions or future actions to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects; and\n\n(6) Copies or summaries of any views provided by consulting parties and the public. \n\n(f) Memorandum of agreement. When a memorandum of agreement is filed with the Council, the documentation shall include, any substantive revisions or additions to the documentation provided the Council pursuant to § 800.6(a)(1), an evaluation of any measures considered to avoid or minimize the undertaking's adverse effects and a summary of the views of consulting parties and the public. \n\n(g) Requests for comment without a memorandum of agreement. Documentation shall include: \n\n(1) A description and evaluation of any alternatives or mitigation measures that the agency official proposes to resolve the undertaking's adverse effects; \n\n(2) A description of any reasonable alternatives or mitigation measures that were considered but not chosen, and the reasons for their rejection; \n\n(3) Copies or summaries of any views submitted to the agency official concerning the adverse effects of the undertaking on historic properties and alternatives to reduce or avoid those effects; and\n\n(4) Any substantive revisions or additions to the documentation provided the Council pursuant to § 800.6(a)(1).",

The agency official, in consultation with the appropriate SHPOs/THPOs, affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, and the Council, is encouraged to develop procedures for taking historic properties into account during operations which respond to a disaster or emergency declared by the President, a tribal government, or the Governor of a State or which respond to other immediate threats to life or property. If approved by the Council, the procedures shall govern the agency's historic preservation responsibilities during any disaster or emergency in lieu of §§ 800.3 through 800.6. \n\n(b) Alternatives to agency procedures. In the event an agency official proposes an emergency undertaking as an essential and immediate response to a disaster or emergency declared by the President, a tribal government, or the Governor of a State or another immediate threat to life or property, and the agency has not developed procedures pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the agency official may comply with section 106 by: \n\n(1) Following a programmatic agreement developed pursuant to § 800.14(b) that contains specific provisions for dealing with historic properties in emergency situations; or\n\n(2) Notifying the Council, the appropriate SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that may attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties likely to be affected prior to the undertaking and affording them an opportunity to comment within seven days of notification. If the agency official determines that circumstances do not permit seven days for comment, the agency official shall notify the Council, the SHPO/THPO and the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and invite any comments within the time available. \n\n(c) Local governments responsible for section 106 compliance. When a local government official serves as the agency official for section 106 compliance, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an imminent threat to public health or safety as a result of a natural disaster or emergency declared by a local government's chief executive officer or legislative body, provided that if the Council or SHPO/THPO objects to the proposed action within seven days, the agency official shall comply with §§ 800.3 through 800.6. \n\n(d) Applicability. This section applies only to undertakings that will be implemented within 30 days after the disaster or emergency has been formally declared by the appropriate authority. An agency may request an extension of the period of applicability from the Council prior to the expiration of the 30 days.

An agency official may develop a programmatic agreement pursuant to § 800.14(b) to govern the actions to be taken when historic properties are discovered during the implementation of an undertaking. \n\n(2) Using agreement documents. When the agency official's identification efforts in accordance with § 800.4 indicate that historic properties are likely to be discovered during implementation of an undertaking and no programmatic agreement has been developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the agency official shall include in any finding of no adverse effect or memorandum of agreement a process to resolve any adverse effects upon such properties. Actions in conformance with the process satisfy the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and this part. \n\n(b) Discoveries without prior planning. If historic properties are discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties found after the agency official has completed the section 106 process without establishing a process under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency official shall make reasonable efforts to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects to such properties and: \n\n(1) If the agency official has not approved the undertaking or if construction on an approved undertaking has not commenced, consult to resolve adverse effects pursuant to § 800.6; or\n\n(2) If the agency official, the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property agree that such property is of value solely for its scientific, prehistoric, historic or archeological data, the agency official may comply with the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act instead of the procedures in this part and provide the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with a report on the actions within a reasonable time after they are completed; or\n\n(3) If the agency official has approved the undertaking and construction has commenced, determine actions that the agency official can take to resolve adverse effects, and notify the SHPO/THPO, any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property, and the Council within 48 hours of the discovery.

An agency official may develop procedures to implement section 106 and substitute them for all or part of subpart B of this part if they are consistent with the Council's regulations pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(E) of the act. \n\n(1) Development of procedures. The agency official shall consult with the Council, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, or individual SHPO/THPOs, as appropriate, and Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, in the development of alternate procedures, publish notice of the availability of proposed alternate procedures in the Federal Register and take other appropriate steps to seek public input during the development of alternate procedures. \n\n(2) Council review. The agency official shall submit the proposed alternate procedures to the Council for a 60-day review period. If the Council finds the procedures to be consistent with this part, it shall notify the agency official and the agency official may adopt them as final alternate procedures. \n\n(3) Notice. The agency official shall notify the parties with which it has consulted and publish notice of final alternate procedures in the Federal Register. \n\n(4) Legal effect. Alternate procedures adopted pursuant to this subpart substitute for the Council's regulations for the purposes of the agency's compliance with section 106, except that where an Indian tribe has entered into an agreement with the Council to substitute tribal historic preservation regulations for the Council's regulations under section 101(d)(5) of the act, the agency shall follow those regulations in lieu of the agency's procedures regarding undertakings on tribal lands. Prior to the Council entering into such agreements, the Council will provide Federal agencies notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed substitute tribal regulations. \n\n(b) Programmatic agreements. The Council and the agency official may negotiate a programmatic agreement to govern the implementation of a particular program or the resolution of adverse effects from certain complex project situations or multiple undertakings. \n\n(1) Use of programmatic agreements. A programmatic agreement may be used: \n\n(i) When effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or are multi-State or regional in scope; \n\n(ii) When effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined prior to approval of an undertaking; \n\n(iii) When nonfederal parties are delegated major decisionmaking responsibilities; \n\n(iv) Where routine management activities are undertaken at Federal installations, facilities, or other land-management units; or \n\n(v) Where other circumstances warrant a departure from the normal section 106 process. \n\n(2) Developing programmatic agreements for agency programs. (i) The consultation shall involve, as appropriate, SHPO/THPOs, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, other Federal agencies, and members of the public. If the programmatic agreement has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, the agency official shall also follow paragraph (f) of this section. \n\n(ii) Public participation. The agency official shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the program and in accordance with subpart A of this part. The agency official shall consider the nature of the program and its likely effects on historic properties and take steps to involve the individuals, organizations and entities likely to be interested. \n\n(iii) Effect. The programmatic agreement shall take effect when executed by the Council, the agency official and the appropriate SHPOs/THPOs when the programmatic agreement concerns a specific region or the president of NCSHPO when NCSHPO has participated in the consultation. A programmatic agreement shall take effect on tribal lands only when the THPO, Indian tribe, or a designated representative of the tribe is a signatory to the agreement. Compliance with the procedures established by an approved programmatic agreement satisfies the agency's section 106 responsibilities for all individual undertakings of the program covered by the agreement until it expires or is terminated by the agency, the president of NCSHPO when a signatory, or the Council. Termination by an individual SHPO/THPO shall only terminate the application of a regional programmatic agreement within the jurisdiction of the SHPO/THPO. If a THPO assumes the responsibilities of a SHPO pursuant to section 101(d)(2) of the act and the SHPO is signatory to programmatic agreement, the THPO assumes the role of a signatory, including the right to terminate a regional programmatic agreement on lands under the jurisdiction of the tribe. \n\n(iv) Notice. The agency official shall notify the parties with which it has consulted that a programmatic agreement has been executed under paragraph (b) of this section, provide appropriate public notice before it takes effect, and make any internal agency procedures implementing the agreement readily available to the Council, SHPO/THPOs, and the public. \n\n(v) If the Council determines that the terms of a programmatic agreement are not being carried out, or if such an agreement is terminated, the agency official shall comply with subpart B of this part with regard to individual undertakings of the program covered by the agreement. \n\n(3) Developing programmatic agreements for complex or multiple undertakings. Consultation to develop a programmatic agreement for dealing with the potential adverse effects of complex projects or multiple undertakings shall follow § 800.6.

The Council may designate an agreement document as a prototype programmatic agreement that may be used for the same type of program or undertaking in more than one case or area. When an agency official uses such a prototype programmatic agreement, the agency official may develop and execute the agreement with the appropriate SHPO/THPO and the agreement shall become final without need for Council participation in consultation or Council signature. \n\n(c) Exempted categories—(1) Criteria for establishing. The Council or an agency official may propose a program or category of undertakings that may be exempted from review under the provisions of subpart B of this part, if the program or category meets the following criteria:\n\n(i) The actions within the program or category would otherwise qualify as “undertakings” as defined in § 800.16;\n\n(ii) The potential effects of the undertakings within the program or category upon historic properties are foreseeable and likely to be minimal or not adverse; and\n\n(iii) Exemption of the program or category is consistent with the purposes of the act.\n\n(2) Public participation. The proponent of the exemption shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the exemption and in accordance with the standards in subpart A of this part. The proponent of the exemption shall consider the nature of the exemption and its likely effects on historic properties and take steps to involve individuals, organizations and entities likely to be interested.\n\n(3) Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The proponent of the exemption shall notify and consider the views of the SHPOs/THPOs on the exemption.\n\n(4) Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.

The Council shall review an exemption proposal that is supported by documentation describing the program or category for which the exemption is sought, demonstrating that the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section have been met, describing the methods used to seek the views of the public, and summarizing any views submitted by the SHPO/THPOs, the public, and any others consulted. Unless it requests further information, the Council shall approve or reject the proposed exemption within 30 days of receipt, and thereafter notify the relevant agency official and SHPO/THPOs of the decision. The decision shall be based on the consistency of the exemption with the purposes of the act, taking into consideration the magnitude of the exempted undertaking or program and the likelihood of impairment of historic properties in accordance with section 214 of the act.\n\n(6) Legal consequences. Any undertaking that falls within an approved exempted program or category shall require no further review pursuant to subpart B of this part, unless the agency official or the Council determines that there are circumstances under which the normally excluded undertaking should be reviewed under subpart B of this part.\n\n(7) Termination. The Council may terminate an exemption at the request of the agency official or when the Council determines that the exemption no longer meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Council shall notify the agency official 30 days before termination becomes effective.\n\n(8) Notice. The proponent of the exemption shall publish notice of any approved exemption in the Federal Register.\n\n(d) Standard treatments—(1) Establishment. The Council, on its own initiative or at the request of another party, may establish standard methods for the treatment of a category of historic properties, a category of undertakings, or a category of effects on historic properties to assist Federal agencies in satisfying the requirements of subpart B of this part. The Council shall publish notice of standard treatments in the Federal Register. \n\n(2) Public participation. The Council shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the standard treatment and consistent with subpart A of this part. The Council shall consider the nature of the standard treatment and its likely effects on historic properties and the individuals, organizations and entities likely to be interested. Where an agency official has proposed a standard treatment, the Council may request the agency official to arrange for public involvement. \n\n(3) Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The Council shall notify and consider the views of SHPOs/THPOs on the proposed standard treatment. \n\n(4) Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. If the proposed standard treatment has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, the Council shall follow the requirements for the agency official set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. \n\n(5) Termination. The Council may terminate a standard treatment by publication of a notice in the Federal Register 30 days before the termination takes effect. \n\n(e) Program comments. An agency official may request the Council to comment on a category of undertakings in lieu of conducting individual reviews under §§ 800.4 through 800.6. The Council may provide program comments at its own initiative. \n\n(1) Agency request. The agency official shall identify the category of undertakings, specify the likely effects on historic properties, specify the steps the agency official will take to ensure that the effects are taken into account, identify the time period for which the comment is requested and summarize any views submitted by the public. \n\n(2) Public participation. The agency official shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the category and in accordance with the standards in subpart A of this part. The agency official shall consider the nature of the undertakings and their likely effects on historic properties and the individuals, organizations and entities likely to be interested. \n\n(3) Consultation with SHPOs/THPOs. The Council shall notify and consider the views of SHPOs/THPOs on the proposed program comment. \n\n(4) Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. If the program comment has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, the Council shall follow the requirements for the agency official set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. \n\n(5) Council action. Unless the Council requests additional documentation, notifies the agency official that it will decline to comment, or obtains the consent of the agency official to extend the period for providing comment, the Council shall comment to the agency official within 45 days of the request. \n\n(i) If the Council comments, the agency official shall take into account the comments of the Council in carrying out the undertakings within the category and publish notice in the Federal Register of the Council's comments and steps the agency will take to ensure that effects to historic properties are taken into account. \n\n(ii) If the Council declines to comment, the agency official shall continue to comply with the requirements of §§ 800.3 through 800.6 for the individual undertakings. \n\n(6) Withdrawal of comment. If the Council determines that the consideration of historic properties is not being carried out in a manner consistent with the program comment, the Council may withdraw the comment and the agency official shall comply with the requirements of §§ 800.3 through 800.6 for the individual undertakings. \n\n(f) Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations when developing program alternatives. Whenever an agency official proposes a program alternative pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, the agency official shall ensure that development of the program alternative includes appropriate government-to-government consultation with affected Indian tribes and consultation with affected Native Hawaiian organizations. \n\n(1) Identifying affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. If any undertaking covered by a proposed program alternative has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands, the agency official shall identify and consult with the Indian tribes having jurisdiction over such lands. If a proposed program alternative has the potential to affect historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization which are located off tribal lands, the agency official shall identify those Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to such properties and consult with them. When a proposed program alternative has nationwide applicability, the agency official shall identify an appropriate government to government consultation with Indian tribes and consult with Native Hawaiian organizations in accordance with existing Executive orders, Presidential memoranda, and applicable provisions of law. \n\n(2) Results of consultation. The agency official shall provide summaries of the views, along with copies of any written comments, provided by affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to the Council as part of the documentation for the proposed program alternative. The agency official and the Council shall take those views into account in reaching a final decision on the proposed program alternative. \n\n[65 FR 77725, Dec. 12, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 40554, July 6, 2004]",

          "content": "§ 902.54   Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.\n(a) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are privileged and for which confidentiality is requested by the person possessing such privilege are within the statutory exemption. This includes the following:\n\n(1) Commercial or financial information not customarily released to the public, furnished and accepted in confidence or disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, or both;\n\n(2) Statements of financial interest furnished by officers and employees of the Corporation;\n\n(3) Commercial, technical, and financial information furnished by any person in connection with an application for a loan or a loan guarantee;\n\n(4) Commercial or financial information customarily subjected to an attorney-client or similar evidentiary privilege; or,\n\n(5) Materials in which the Corporation has a property right such as designs, drawings, and other data and reports acquired in connection with any research project, inside or outside of the Corporation, or any grant or contract.\n\n(b) The purpose of this section is to authorize the protection of trade secrets and commercial or financial records that are customarily privileged or are appropriately given to the Corporation in confidence. It assures the confidentiality of trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by the Corporation through questionnaires and required reports to the extent that the information would not customarily be made public by the person from whom it was obtained. In any case in which the Corporation has obligated itself not to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information it receives, this section indicates the Corporation's intention to honor that obligation to the extent permitted by law. In addition, this section recognizes that certain materials, such as research data and materials, formulae, designs, and architectural drawings, have significance not as records but as items of property acquired, in many cases at public expense. In any case in which similar proprietary material in private hands would be held in confidence, material covered in this section may be held in confidence.\n\n(c)(1) In general. For commercial or financial information furnished to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall require the submitter to designate, at the time the information is furnished or within a reasonable time thereafter, any information the submitter considers confidential or privileged. Commercial or financial information provided to the Corporation shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this paragraph.\n\n(2) Notice to submitters. The Corporation shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing its commercial or financial information whenever required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and except as is provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the information. Concurrently with its notice to a submitter, the Corporation shall inform a requestor in writing that the submitter is afforded a reasonable period within which to object to disclosure and that the 10 workday initial determination period provided for in 36 CFR 902.60 may therefore be extended.\n\n(3) When notice is required. (i) For information submitted to the Corporation prior to March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:\n\n(A) The information is less than ten years old;\n\n(B) The information is subject to prior express commitment of confidentiality given by the Corporation to the submitter; or\n\n(C) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.\n\n(ii) For information submitted to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:\n\n(A) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential, or\n\n(B) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.\n\nNotice of a request for information falling within the former category shall be required for a period of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless the submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for, a specific notice period of greater duration. The submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative that the information in question is in fact confidential and has not been disclosed to the public.\n\n(4) Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Corporation shall afford a submitter a reasonable period within which to provide the Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be privileged or confidential. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n(5) Notice of intent to disclose. The Corporation shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose information. Whenever the Corporation decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Corporation shall forward to the submitter a written notice which shall include:\n\n(i) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;\n\n(ii) A description of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(iii) A specified disclosure date.\n\nSuch notice of intent to disclose shall be forwarded a reasonable number of days, as circumstances permit, prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended. A copy of such disclosure notice shall be forwarded to the requester at the same time.\n\n(6) Notice of lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of information covered by paragraph (c) of this section, the Corporation shall promptly notify the submitter.\n\n(7) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:\n\n(i) The Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed;\n\n(ii) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public;\n\n(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or\n\n(iv) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the Corporation shall provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n[41 FR 43143, Sept. 30, 1976, as amended at 53 FR 10374, Mar. 31, 1988]",

One is to protect the full and frank exchange of ideas, views, and opinions necessary for the effective functioning of the Government and to afford this protection both before and after any action is taken. This judicially recognized privilege of protection against disclosure in litigation or elsewhere is intended to assure that these resources will be fully and readily available to those officials upon whom the responsibility rests to take official and final Corporation action. However, the action itself, any memoranda made part of that action, and the facts on which it is based are not within this protection. The other purpose is to protect against the premature disclosure of material that is in the development stage if premature disclosure would be detrimental to the authorized and appropriate purposes for which the material is being used, or if, because of its tentative nature, the material is likely to be revised or modified before it is officially presented to the public.\n\n(c) Examples of records covered by this section include minutes to the extent they contain matter described in paragraph (a) of this section; staff papers containing advice, opinions, suggestions, or exchanges of views, preliminary to final agency decision or action; budgetary planning and programming information; advance information on such things as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise hire and dispose of materials, real estate, or facilities, documents exchanged preparatory to anticipated legal proceedings; material intended for public release at a specified future time, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to orderly processes of the Corporation; records of inspection, investigations, and surveys pertaining to internal management of the Department; and matters that would not be routinely disclosed under disclosure procedures in litigation and which are likely to be the subject of litigation. However, if such a record also contains factual information, that information must be made available under subpart E of this part unless the facts are so inextricably intertwined with deliverative or policymaking processes, that they cannot be separated without disclosing those processes.",

          "content": "§ 902.82   Fee schedule.\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section— \n\n(1) A commercial use request is a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will determine the use to which the requester will put the records sought. Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Corporation will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. \n\n(2) Direct costs means those expenditures the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) records to respond to an FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored. \n\n(3) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.\n\n(4) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. \n\n(5) Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. \n\n(6) Representative of the new media means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. \n\n(7) Review means the process of examining records located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any records for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. \n\n(8) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within records. A line-by-line search will not be conducted when merely duplicating an entire record would be the less expensive and quicker method of complying with the request. Search does not include review of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. \n\n(b) The following provisions shall apply with respect to services rendered to the public in processing requests for disclosure of the Corporation's records under this part: \n\n(1) Fee for duplication of records: $0.25 per page. When the Corporation estimates that duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. The Corporation will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with the Corporation's staff in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. \n\n(2) Search and review fees. (i) Searches for records by clerical personnel: $7.00 per hour, including the time spent searching for and copying any records. \n\n(ii) Search for and review of records by professional and supervisory personnel: $11.50 per hour spent searching for any record or reviewing any record to determine whether it may be disclosed, including time spent in copying any record. \n\n(iii) Except for requests seeking records for a commercial use, the Corporation will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. The word pages means paper copies of a standard size, either 8\n1/2″ by 11″ or 14″ by 14″. \n\n(3) Duplication of architectural drawings, maps, and similar materials: (per copy) $10.00. \n\n(4) Reproduction of 35 mm slides: (per copy) $1.00. \n\n(5) Reproduction of enlarged, black and white photographs: (per copy) $10.00. \n\n(6) Reproduction of enlarged color photographs: (per copy) $17.00. \n\n(7) Certification and validation fee: $1.75 for each certification or validation of a copy of any record. \n\n(8) Categories of FOIA requesters and fees to be charged—(i) Commercial use requesters. When the Corporation receives a request for records for commercial use, it will assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought. \n\n(ii) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters. The Corporation shall provide copies of records to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought. \n\n(iii) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. The Corporation shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in the definition of representative of the news media in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requestors must reasonably describe the records sought. \n\n(iv) All other requesters. The Corporation will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requests from record subjects for records about themselves filed in the Corporation's systems of records will be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.\n\n(9) Interest. In the event a requester fails to remit payment of fees charged for processing a request under this part within 30 days from the date such fees were billed, interest on such fees may be assessed beginning on the 31st day after the billing date at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C., and will accrue from the date of the billing. \n\n(10) Unsuccessful searches. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, the cost of searching for a requested record shall be charged even if the search fails to locate such record or it is determined that the record is exempt from disclosure. \n\n(11) Aggregating requests. A requester must not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a record or records, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. \n\n(12) Advance payments. The Corporation will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request unless: \n\n(i) The Corporation estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or \n\n(ii) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payments (i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest accrued thereon or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Corporation begins to process a new request or a pending request from this requester. \n\n(iii) With regard to any request coming within paragraphs (b)(12) (i) and (ii) of this section, the administrative time limits set forth in §§ 902.60, 902.61, and 902.62 of this part will begin to run only after the Corporation has received the requisite fee payments. \n\n(iv) Non-payment. In the event of nonpayment of billed charges for disclosure of records, the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer credit reporting agencies and referral to collection agencies, where appropriate, may be utilized to obtain payment. \n\n[52 FR 26677, July 16, 1987]",

L. 92-578, October 27, 1972, (the Act), (40 U.S.C. 871 et seq.) established the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (the Corporation) with jurisdiction over the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area (Development Area). The Development Area is generally described as an area in Washington DC, bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., on the south, East Executive Drive on the west, 3rd Street, NW., on the east, and E and F Streets, NW., on the north. \n\n(b) Prior to creation of the Corporation, the deterioration of the Development Area had an adverse impact upon the physical, economic, and social life of Washington, DC. The Corporation was created as the vehicle to develop, maintain, and use the Development Area in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the Federal government, to the governmental buildings, monuments, memorials, and parks in and adjacent to that area, and to the downtown commercial core of Washington, DC. The Corporation was directed to prepare a development plan for the Development Area and to submit that plan to the United States Congress. Congress accepted that plan and directed its implementation by the Corporation. The Corporation through a broad range of statutory powers has begun this implementation process. \n\n(c) The Pennsylvania Avenue Plan—1974, as amended (the Plan) is a blueprint for social, economic, and architectural rejuvenation of the Development Area. Its goal is to make the Development Area once again a relevant and contributing element of Washington, DC. With the implementation of the Plan, the Development Area will become a showpiece of the Nation's Capital, proudly displaying the successful joint efforts of the Corporation, other Federal and District of Columbia government agencies, and private entrepreneurs. \n\n(d) The Plan, containing the goals and objectives for development, is supplemented by various adopted policies and programs of the Corporation. The Plan, in conjunction with these policies and programs, represents the basis upon which the development and rejuvenation of the Development Area will proceed, whether publicly or privately inspired and accomplished. These policies and programs amplify, elaborate, and refine the planning and urban design concepts expressed in the Plan.",

          "content": "§ 910.2   Purpose.\n(a) Implementation of the Plan occurs through two component actions: public improvements construction and square development. Public improvements construction consists of implementation by the Corporation of the Public Improvements Program which is a comprehensive plan for the design and construction of public amenities in public spaces and selected thoroughfares within the Development Area. This program outlines the details of roadway and sidewalk improvements, public space configuration, and pedestrian amenities. Square development consists of design and construction of development projects primarily on city blocks, known as squares, within the Development Area. These development projects are generally pursued by private entrepreneurs with varying degrees of participation and involvement by the Corporation, through such means as land assemblage and leasing. \n\n(b) This part 910, together with the Square Guidelines applicable to the coordinated planning area, pertains solely to square development and specifies the controlling mechanism for implementation of the Plan required by Chapter Six of the Plan.",

These requirements and recommendations set forth intentions and refinements of the Plan in light of the identified Planning and Design Concerns specified in subpart B of this part 910. Each set of Square Guidelines is adopted by the Board of Directors, issued by the Chairman, and is available, upon request, at the Corporation's office. \n\n(3) Square Guidelines are developed in the context of the existing environment. Several provisions in the Square Guidelines are, therefore, established on the basis of certain assumptions in terms of existing buildings, a particular traffic pattern and roadway configuration, a market condition for a particular land use, etc. In the event of a major change or casualty which would render it impossible or impracticable to meet certain requirements of Square Guidelines, the Corporation would expect to develop and issue up-to-date Square Guidelines. This statement does not, of course, preclude the Corporation from issuing amendments to Square Guidelines from time to time on any other basis. \n\n(b) Pursuant to section 7(b) of the Act, each proposal for development within the Development Area must be submitted to the Corporation to determine its consistency with the Plan. The Corporation's adopted development policy, entitled “Development Policies and Procedures,” sets forth the process for this determination. In determining whether a development proposal is consistent with the Plan, the Corporation shall review the proposal against all adopted Corporation programs, policies, and regulations, including: \n\n(1) This part 910. \n\n(2) Square Guidelines. \n\n(3) Development Policies and Procedures. \n\n(4) Historic Preservation Plan. \n\n(5) Energy Guidelines. \n\n(6) Side Street Improvements Program. \n\n(7) Policy on Environmental Quality and Control (36 CFR part 907). \n\n(8) Pennsylvania Avenue Lighting Plan. \n\n(9) Public Improvements Program. \n\n(10) Affirmative Action Policy and Procedure (36 CFR part 906). \n\n(11) Policy and Procedures to Facilitate Successful Relocation of Businesses and Residents within the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area. \n\n(12) All other programs, policies, and regulations that may be approved and adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time. \n\n(c) Pursuant to the Act, Federal and District of Columbia agencies and departments may exercise such existing authority and lawful powers over urban planning and design features of development as are consistent with the Plan. No department or agency may release, modify, or depart from any feature of the Plan without the prior approval of the Corporation.",

(1) The Presidio Trust will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.\n\n(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date the debt becomes delinquent. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of interest on that portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Presidio Trust will assess interest at the rate established by the Treasury Department under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is established by a contract, repayment agreement or statute. The Presidio Trust will notify the debtor of the basis for the interest rate assessed.\n\n(b) Penalty. The Presidio Trust will assess a penalty of not more than 6% a year, or such other higher rate as authorized by law, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.\n\n(c) Administrative costs. The Presidio Trust will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of the debtor's failure to pay a debt. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of administrative costs on that portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which the administrative costs begin to accrue. Administrative costs include the costs of processing and handling a debt, obtaining a credit report, using a private collection contractor, costs of a hearing including, the costs of a hearing officer, and service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Presidio Trust.\n\n(d) Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to outstanding debt principal.\n\n(e) Additional authority. The Presidio Trust may have additional policies, guidelines and procedures regarding how interest, penalties and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts. The Presidio Trust will explain in the notice to the debtor described in § 1011.4 of this part how interest, penalties, administrative costs and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a contract or repayment agreement.\n\n(f) Waiver. (1) The Presidio Trust may waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalties and administrative costs when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best interest to collect such charges.\n\n(2) A decision to waive interest, penalties or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, unless otherwise provided in these regulations, when these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded.\n\n(g) Accrual during suspension of debt collection. In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). The Presidio Trust may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best interest.\n\n[70 FR 73588, Dec. 13, 2005; 71 FR 2109, Jan. 12, 2006]",

Unless a delinquent debt has previously been transferred to the FMS for administrative offset in accordance with § 1011.10, the Presidio Trust will transfer any eligible debt that is more than 180 days delinquent to the FMS for debt collection services, a process known as “cross-servicing.” The Presidio Trust may transfer debts delinquent 180 days or less to the FMS in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The FMS takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt and the collection action to be taken. Appropriate action includes, without limitation, contact with the debtor, referral of the debt to the Treasury Offset Program, private collection agencies or the Department of Justice, reporting of the debt to credit bureaus, and administrative wage garnishment.\n\n\n\n(b) Notice; certification. At least 60 days prior to transferring a debt to the FMS, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor as required by § 1011.4 of this part.

In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify its compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal laws.\n\n(c) Treasury Offset Program. As part of its debt collection process, the FMS uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts by administrative and tax refund offset. The Treasury Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the FMS to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a federal payment is disbursed, the FMS compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the FMS (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, without limitation, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.\n\n[70 FR 73588, Dec. 13, 2005, as amended at 83 FR 50838, Oct. 10, 2018]",

(1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, the Presidio Trust may collect delinquent, legally enforceable debts through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, the Presidio Trust may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a federal paying agency.\n\n(2) At least 30 days prior to offsetting a payment internally or requesting a federal paying agency to offset a payment, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part.

In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify its compliance with the due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and with these regulations concerning administrative offset.\n\n(c) Administrative review. The notice described in § 1011.4 of this part will explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review of the Presidio Trust determination that the debtor owes a debt and how to present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount of the debt, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In most cases, the Presidio Trust will provide the debtor with a “paper hearing” based upon a review of the written record, including documentation provided by the debtor. The Presidio Trust will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Presidio Trust determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Presidio Trust will document all significant matters presented at the hearing. The Presidio Trust may suspend collection through administrative offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's dispute. The Presidio Trust may establish policies, guidelines and procedures concerning the administrative review process consistent with the FCCS and the regulations in this section.\n\n(d) Procedures for expedited offset. Under the circumstances described by the FCCS, the Presidio Trust may effect an offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor, as described in § 1011.4 of this part, or completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section. The Presidio Trust will give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.\n\n[70 FR 73588, Dec. 13, 2005, as amended at 83 FR 50838, Oct. 10, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1011.12   How will the Presidio Trust offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a debt?\n(a) Federal salary offset. (1) Salary offset is used to collect debts owed to the United States by Federal employees. If a Presidio Trust employee owes a debt, the Presidio Trust may offset the employee's federal salary to collect the debt in the manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal agency other than the Presidio Trust may collect a debt from the salary of a Presidio Trust employee, see § 1011.21 and 1011.22, subpart C, of this part.\n\n(2) Nothing in this part requires the Presidio Trust to collect a debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law allows otherwise.\n\n(b) Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program. As described in § 1011.9(a) of this part, the Presidio Trust will refer debts to the FMS for collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program.\n\n(c) Non-centralized salary offset for Treasury debts. The Presidio Trust may collect delinquent debts through non-centralized salary offset. In these cases, the Presidio Trust may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a paying agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed by a Federal employee. At least 30 days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset, the Presidio Trust will certify to the paying agency, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the process for salary offset.\n\n(d) When prior notice not required. The Presidio Trust is not required to provide prior notice to a Presidio Trust employee when the following adjustments are made:\n\n(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of a Presidio Trust employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or fewer;\n\n(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or\n\n(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.\n\n(e) Hearing procedures. (1) Request for a hearing. A Presidio Trust employee who has received a notice that a debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt. The employee also may request a hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in § 1011.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th business day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.\n\n(2) Failure to submit timely request for hearing. If the employee fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, the Presidio Trust may accept a late request for hearing if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.\n\n(3) Hearing official. The Presidio Trust hearing must be conducted by a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Board of Directors of the Presidio Trust. The hearing official need not be an employee of the Federal Government.\n\n(4) Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, a designated hearing official will inform the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice will set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice will notify the employee of the date by which the employee should submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing official will give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The hearing official will schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing official will give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.\n\n(5) Oral hearing. The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing if the official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing official will determine the procedure for the oral hearing, determining, for example, the hearing length.\n\n(6) Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the official will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of the employee's position.\n\n(7) Date of decision. The hearing official will issue a written opinion setting forth the decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing.\n\n(8) Final agency action. The hearing official's decision will be final.\n\n(f) Salary offset process. (1) Determination of disposable pay. The Presidio Trust payroll office will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay (as defined in § 1011.1 of this part) and will implement salary offset.\n\n(2) When salary offset begins. Deductions will begin within three official pay periods.\n\n(3) Amount of salary offset. The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15% of the employee's disposable pay, as follows:\n\n(i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15% of the disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump sum payment;\n\n(ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15% of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.\n\n(4) Final salary payment. After the employee's employment with the Presidio Trust ends, the Presidio Trust may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15% of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments in order to satisfy a debt.",

The Presidio Trust is authorized to collect debts from a debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of the FCCS and other applicable law. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described therein. The Presidio Trust may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the debt in installments (see § 1011.6 of this part).

A debtor who owes a debt may, at any time, request a special review by the Presidio Trust of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, without limitation, catastrophic illness, divorce, death or disability.\n\n(b) Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the debtor must submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, the debtor's, and dependents, indicating:\n\n(1) Income from all sources;\n\n(2) Assets;\n\n(3) Liabilities;\n\n(4) Number of dependents;\n\n(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing and transportation;\n\n(6) Medical expenses; and\n\n(7) Exceptional expenses, if any.\n\n(c) Alternative payment arrangement.

The Presidio Trust will notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment or repayment schedule, the Presidio Trust will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.",

          "content": "§ 1011.21   How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by the Presidio Trust?\n(a) Offset of Presidio Trust payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies. (1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by other Federal agencies, a process known as “centralized offset.” When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask the Presidio Trust (when acting as a paying agency) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Presidio Trust, including salary payments issued to the Presidio Trust employees. This section and § 1011.22 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks the Presidio Trust to offset a payment issued by the Presidio Trust to a person who owes a debt to the United States.\n\n(2) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of debts through tax refund offset.\n\n(b) Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification. The Presidio Trust will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the delinquent, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and other requirements, and the creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.\n\n(c) Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset. Requests for offset under this section must be sent to the Presidio Trust, ATTN: Chief Financial Officer, P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129-0052.\n\n(d) Incomplete certification. The Presidio Trust will return an incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by the Presidio Trust.\n\n(e) Review. The Presidio Trust is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.\n\n(f) When the Presidio Trust will not comply with offset request. The Presidio Trust will comply with the offset request of another agency unless the Presidio Trust determines that the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to law.\n\n(g) Multiple debts. When two or more creditor agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Presidio Trust may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by offset simultaneously.\n\n(h) Priority of debts owed to the Presidio Trust. For purposes of this section, debts owed to the Presidio Trust generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. The Presidio Trust may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to the Presidio Trust. The Presidio Trust will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.",

          "content": "§ 1011.22   What does the Presidio Trust do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a Presidio Trust employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?\n(a) Notice to the Presidio Trust employee. When the Presidio Trust receives proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, the Presidio Trust will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the next officially established pay interval. The Presidio Trust will send a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed to the creditor agency, the date deductions from salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions.\n\n(b) Amount of deductions from a Presidio Trust employee's salary. The amount deducted under § 1011.21(b) of this part will be the lesser of the amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay. Deductions will continue until the Presidio Trust knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency. See § 1011.12(g) (salary offset process).\n\n(c) When the debtor is no longer employed by the Presidio Trust—(1) Offset of final and subsequent payments. If the Presidio Trust employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, the Presidio Trust will continue to offset up to 100% of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by the Presidio Trust.\n\n(2) Notice to the creditor agency. If the employee's employment with the Presidio Trust terminates before the debt is paid in full, the Presidio Trust will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If the Presidio Trust is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Presidio Trust will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 1011.9(c) of this part.\n\n(3) Notice to the debtor. The Presidio Trust will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n(d) When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency—(1) Notice to the creditor agency. If the debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, the Presidio Trust will notify the creditor agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. The Presidio Trust will provide a copy of the certification to the creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.\n\n(2) Notice to the debtor. The Presidio Trust will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.\n\n(e) Request for hearing official. The Presidio Trust will provide a hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to the Presidio Trust employee.",

          "content": "§ 1120.2   Definitions.\nFor the purposes of this part:\n\n(a) A&TBCB or Board means the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. \n\n(b) A&TBCB record or record means any document, writing, photograph, sound or magnetic recording, drawing or other similar thing by which information has been preserved, from which the information can be retrieved and copied, and which is, was, or is alleged to be under the control of the A&TBCB. \n\n(1) The term includes— \n\n(i) Informal writings such as handwritten notes and drafts; \n\n(ii) Information preserved in a form which must be translated or deciphered by machine in order to be intelligible to humans; \n\n(iii) Records which were created or acquired by the A&TBCB, its members, its employees, its members' employees, or persons acting on behalf of its members, by use of A&TBCB funds or in the course of transacting official business for the A&TBCB. \n\n(2) The term does not include— \n\n(i) Materials which are legally owned by an A&TBCB member, employee, or member's employee or representative in his or her purely personal capacity; and \n\n(ii) Materials published by non-Federal organizations which are readily available to the public, such as books, journals, standards, and periodicals available through reference libraries, even if such materials are in the A&TBCB's possession. \n\n(c) The terms agency, person, party, rule, rulemaking, order, and adjudication have the meanings given in 5 U.S.C. 551, except where the context demonstrates that a different meaning is intended, and except that for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act the term agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, the United States Postal Service, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President) or any independent regulatory agency. \n\n(d) A government record under the control of the A&TBCB means that the record is subject to the free disposition of the A&TBCB. This includes keeping the record available for governmental use as required and protecting, preserving, and exercising such control over it as may be necessary for that purpose. Control of a record is not synonymous with, and does not require, actual physical possession of the record. \n\n(e) Request means a request to inspect or obtain a copy of one or more records. \n\n(f) Requestor means any person who submits a request to the A&TBCB. \n\n(g) Public member means a member appointed by the President from among members of the general public. \n\n(h) Direct Costs means those expenditures which an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.\n\n(i) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Agencies should ensure that searching for material is done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester. For example, agencies should not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. Search should be distinguished, moreover, from review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (k) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.\n\n(j) Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.\n\n(k) Review refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (l) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(l) Commercial Use Request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, agencies must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where an agency has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, agencies should seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.\n\n(m) Educational Institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\n(n) Non-Commercial Scientific Institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (l) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\n(o) Representative of the News Media refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.\n\nMoreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of freelance journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but agencies may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.\n\n[45 FR 80976, Dec. 8, 1980, as amended at 52 FR 43195, Nov. 10, 1987; 55 FR 2519, Jan. 25, 1990]",

Each member and employee of the A&TBCB is directed to cooperate to this end and to make records available to the public promptly and to the fullest extent consistent with this policy. A record may not be withheld from the public solely because its release might suggest administrative error or embarrass a member or employee of the A&TBCB. \n\n(b) Subject to § 1120.51, any nonexempt A&TBCB record is available to the public upon request regardless of whether the requestor shows any justification or need for the record.\n\n(c) An A&TBCB office may waive the procedures on this subpart in favor of the requestor, for reasons of the public interest, simplicity, or speed.\n\n(d) If a requested record contains both exempt and nonexempt material, the nonexempt material shall be disclosed, after the exempt material has been deleted in accordance with § 1120.42.",

No request under 5 U.S.C. 552 for an existing, located, unpublished record in the A&TBCB's control may be denied by any A&TBCB office or employee unless the record contains (or its disclosure would reveal) matters that are—\n\n(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to the Executive order;\n\n(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;\n\n(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;\n\n(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;\n\n(5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;\n\n(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would—\n\n(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n\n(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n\n(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;\n\n(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or\n\n(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;\n\n(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or\n\n(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.\n\n(b) The fact that the applicability of an exemption permits the withholding of a requested record (or portion of a record) does not necessarily mean that the record must or should be withheld.

Requesters will be charged fees, in accordance with the administrative provisions and fee schedule set forth below, for searching for, reviewing (in the case of commercial use requesters only), and duplicating requested records.\n\n(b) Categories of requesters. For the purpose of standard FOIA fee assessment, the four categories of requesters are: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters; requesters who are representatives of the news media; and, all other requesters (see § 1120.2 (l) through (o), Definitions).\n\n(c) Levels of fees. Levels of fees prescribed for each category of requester are as follows:\n\n(1) Commercial Use Requesters—When the ATBCB receives a request for documents which appears to be a request for commercial use, the Board may assess charges in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Costs for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure applies to the initial review only. No fees will be assessed for reviewing records, at the administrative appeal level, of the exemptions already applied.\n\n(2) Educational and Non-Commercial Scientific Institution Requesters—The ATBCB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduced documents.\n\n(i) To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must demonstrate the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (it the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.\n\n(ii) Requesters eligible for free search must reasonably describe the records sought.\n\n(3) Requesters Who Are Representatives of the News Media—The ATBCB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduced documents.\n\n(4) All Other Requestors—The ATBCB shall charge requestors who do not fit into any of the categories described above, fees which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of reproduction shall be furnished without charge. \n\n(d) Schedule of FOIA fees. \n\n(1) Record search (ATBCB employees)—$14.00 per hour \n\n(2) Document review (ATBCB employees)—$20.00 per hour \n\n(3) Duplication of documents (paper copy of paper original)—$.20 per page \n\n(e) No charge shall be made: \n\n(1) If the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee; \n\n(2) For any request made by an individual or group of individuals falling into the categories listed at paragraph (b) of this section, and described in paragraph (c) of this section, (excepting commercial use requests) the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages of duplication; \n\n(3) For the cost of preparing or reviewing letters of response to a request or appeal; \n\n(4) For responding to a request for one copy of the official personnel record of the requestor; \n\n(5) For furnishing records requested by either House of Congress, or by duly authorized committee or subcommittee or Congress, unless the records are requested for the benefit of an individual Member of Congress or for a constituent; \n\n(6) For furnishing records requested by and for the official use of other Federal agencies; or \n\n(7) For furnishing records needed by an A&TBCB contractor or grantee to perform the work required by the A&TBCB contract or grant.\n\n(f) Requestors may be charged for unsuccessful or unproductive searches or for searches when records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. \n\n(g) Where the ATBCB reasonably believes that a requestor or group of requestors is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the ATBCB shall aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.\n\n[55 FR 2520, Jan. 25, 1990]",

          "content": "§ 1120.53   Payment of fees.\n(a) Method of payment. All fee payments shall be in the form of a check or money order payable to the order of the “U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board” and shall be sent (accompanied by a reference to the pertinent Request Indentification Number(s)) to the address in § 1120.23.\n\n(b) Charging interest. The ATBCB may charge interest to those requestors failing to pay fees assessed in accordance with the procedures described in § 1120.51. Interest charges, computed at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C.A., will be assessed on the full amount billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent. \n\n(c) Advance payment or assurance of payment. (1) When an ATBCB office determines or estimates that the allowable charges a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the ATBCB may require the requestor to make an advance payment or arrangements to pay the entire fee before continuing to process the request. The ATBCB shall promptly inform the requestor (by telephone, if practicable) of the need to make an advance payment or arrangements to pay the fee. That office need not search for, review, duplicate, or disclose records in response to any request by that requestor until he or she pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, the total amount of fees due (or estimated to become due) under this subpart.\n\n(2) Where a requestor has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion, the ATBCB may require the requestor to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before any new or pending requests will be processed from that requestor. \n\n(3) In those instances described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in § 1120.33(d) will begin only after the ATBCB has received all fee payments due or acceptable arrangements have been made to pay all fee payments due. \n\n(d) Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). Requestors are advised that the ATBCB shall use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment of debts arising from freedom of information act requests. \n\n(e) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that establsihed under paragraph (d) of § 1120.51 where the Freedom of Information Officer determines, based upon information provided by a requestor in support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Freedom of Information Officer, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. \n\n(2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government—Freedom of Information Officer shall consider the following four factors in sequence:\n\n(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.” The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government—with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their informative value with respect to those government operations or activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic informational content alone will not satisfy this threshold consideration. \n\n(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative on specific government operations or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increase public understanding of those operations and activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public record. \n\n(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons. A requestor's identity and qualifications—e.g., expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the general public—should be considered. It reasonably may be presumed that a representative of the news media (as defined in § 1120.2(o)) who has access to the means of public dissemination readily will be able to satisfy this consideration. Requests from libraries or other record repositories (or requestors who intend merely to disseminate information to such institutions) shall be analyzed, like those of other requestors to identify a particular person who represents that he actually will use the requested information in scholarly or other analytic work and then disseminate it to the general public.\n\n(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. Freedom of Information Officer shall not make separate value judgments as to whether information, even though it in fact would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, is “important” enough to be made public.\n\n(3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor—the Freedom of Information Officer shall consider the following two factors in sequence: \n\n(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requestor has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. The Freedom of Information Officer shall consider all commercial interests of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in § 1120.2(l)) or any person on whose behalf the requestor may be acting, but shall consider only those interests which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercial interests, consideration shall be given to the role that such FOIA-disclosed information plays with respect to those commercial interests, as well as to the extent to which FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall. Requestors shall be given a reasonable opportunity in the administrative process to provide information bearing upon this consideration. \n\n(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.” A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where, once the “public interest” standard set out in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is satisfied, that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude than that of the requestor's commercial interest in disclosure. The Freedom of Information Officer shall ordinarily presume that where a news media requestor has satisfied the “public interest” standard, that will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requestor. Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve “public interest.” \n\n(4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion. \n\n(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each of the factors listed in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, as they apply to each record request. One hundred pages of reproduction shall be furnished without charge. \n\n(6) A request for reduction or waiver of fees shall be addressed to the Freedom of Information Officer at the address shown in § 1120.23. The ATBCB office which is responding to the request for records shall initially determine whether the fee shall be reduced or waived and shall so inform the requestor. The initial determination may be appealed by letter addressed to the address shown in § 1120.23. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall decide such appeals.\n\n[45 FR 80976, Dec. 8, 1980, as amended at 52 FR 43196, Nov. 10, 1987; 55 FR 2521, Jan. 25, 1990]",

In addition, the A&TBCB shall apprise any person who might become a party to compliance proceedings of the alleged instances of noncompliance and afford him/her a reasonable opportunity to respond or submit pertinent documents. \n\n(b) The Executive Director or his/her designee shall seek the cooperation of persons and agencies in obtaining compliance and shall provide assistance and guidance to help them comply voluntarily. \n\n(c) Upon request of the Executive Director, interested agencies or persons, including, but not limited to, occupant agencies, recipients of assistance, and lessors, shall submit to the Executive Director or his/her designee timely, complete, and accurate reports concerning the particular complaint. Reports shall be completed at such times, and in such form containing all information as the Executive Director or his/her designee may prescribe. \n\n(d) The Executive Director, or his/her designee, shall have access during normal business hours to books, records, accounts and other sources of information and facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance. Considerations of privacy or confidentiality asserted by an agency or person may not bar the Executive Director from evaluating such materials or seeking to enforce compliance. The Executive Director may seek a protective order authorizing the use of allegedly confidential materials on terms and conditions specified by the judge. \n\n(e) Complaints should be resolved informally and expeditiously, by the interested persons or agencies. If compliance with the applicable standards is not achieved informally or an impasse concerning the allegations of compliance or noncompliance is reached, the Executive Director will review the matter, including previous attempts by agencies to resolve the complaint, and take actions including, but not limited to, surveying and investigating buildings, monitoring compliance programs of agencies, furnishing technical assistance, such as standard interpretation, to agencies, and obtaining assurances, certifications, and plans of action as may be necessary to ensure compliance. \n\n(f) All actions to informally resolve complaints under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt of the complaint by all affected agencies and persons. A complaint shall be deemed informally resolved if the person or agencies responsible for the alleged violation either: \n\n(1) Demonstrates to the Executive Director that no violation has occurred, or \n\n(2) Corrects the violation, or \n\n(3) Agrees in writing to implement specific compliance action within a definite time agreed to by the Executive Director, or \n\n(4) Are timely implementing a plan for compliance agreed to by the Executive Director.\n\nNo later than ten (10) days after the determination of the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Executive Director shall either issue a citation under § 1150.42, or determine in writing that a citation will not be issued at that time and the reasons that it is considered unnecessary. \n\n(g) A determination not to issue a citation shall be served in accordance with § 1150.23 on all interested agencies and persons upon whom a citation would have been served if it had been issued. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the failure of the Executive Director to take action within the ten (10) day period after termination of the one hundred eighty (180) day informal resolution period shall not preclude the Executive Director from taking action thereafter. \n\n(h) Nothing in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section shall be construed as precluding the Executive Director before the termination of the one hundred eighty (180) day informal resolution period from: \n\n(1) Issuing a citation if it is reasonably clear that informal resolution cannot be achieved within that time, or \n\n(2) Determining not to issue a citation if it is reasonably clear that compliance can be achieved or that issuance of a citation is not otherwise warranted. \n\n(i) At any time after the expiration of one hundred ninety (190) days after receipt of the complaint by all affected agencies and persons, any person or agency receiving a copy of the complaint, or the complainant, may serve a written request on the Executive Director to issue a citation or determination not to proceed within thirty (30) days.

All new light rail vehicles, other than level entry vehicles, covered by this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and sufficient clearances to permit at least two wheelchair or mobility aid users to reach areas, each with a minimum clear floor space of 48 inches by 30 inches, which do not unduly restrict passenger flow. Space to accommodate wheelchairs and mobility aids may be provided within the normal area used by standees and designation of specific spaces is not required. \n\n(2) Exception. If lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.73(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the vehicle is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device. Where each new vehicle is compatible with a single platform-mounted access system or device, additional systems or devices are not required for each vehicle provided that the single device could be used to provide access to each new vehicle if passengers using wheelchairs or mobility aids could not be accommodated on a single vehicle. \n\n(b) Vehicle lift—(1) Design load. The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material. \n\n(2) Controls—(i) Requirements. The controls shall be interlocked with the vehicle brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position. \n\n(ii) Exception. Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the vehicle axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(iii) Exception. The brake or propulsion system interlocks requirement does not apply to a station platform mounted lift provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that vehicles do not move when the lift is in use. \n\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(4) Power or equipment failure. Lift platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component. \n\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the vehicle until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a minimum 1\n1/2 inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift is more than 3 inches above the station platform or roadway and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged. \n\n(6) Platform surface. The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over \n1/4 inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28\n1/2 inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1) \n\n(7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \n5/8 inch wide. When the lift is at vehicle floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and vehicle floor shall not exceed \n1/2 inch horizontally and \n5/8 inch vertically. Platforms on semiautomatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1\n1/2 inches by 4\n1/2 inches located between the edge barriers. \n\n(8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8 measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from the station platform or roadway to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to \n1/4 inch. Thresholds between \n1/4 inch and \n1/2 inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. \n\n(9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform. \n\n(10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g. \n\n(11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids. \n\n(12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position. \n\n(13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. Handrails shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\n1/4 inches and 1\n1/2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \n1/8 inch.

          "content": "§ 1192.95   Mobility aid accessibility.\n(a)(1) General. All new commuter rail cars, other than level entry cars, covered by this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section; sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or mobility aid user to reach a seating location; and at least two wheelchair or mobility aid seating locations complying with paragraph (d) of this section. \n\n(2) Exception. If portable or platform lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the applicable requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.93(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the car is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device. Where each new car is compatible with a single platform-mounted access system or device, additional systems or devices are not required for each car provided that the single device could be used to provide access to each new car if passengers using wheelchairs or mobility aids could not be accommodated on a single car. \n\n(b) Car Lift—(1) Design load. The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material. \n\n(2) Controls—(i) Requirements. The controls shall be interlocked with the car brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the car cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all platform levels normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position. \n\n(ii) Exception. Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the car axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the car axis and which pivots into or out of the car while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(iii) Exception. The brake or propulsion system interlock requirement does not apply to a platform mounted or portable lift provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that cars do not move when the lift is in use. \n\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground or platform level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(4) Power or equipment failure. Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component. \n\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the car until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which, in its raised position, extends beyond the car shall have a barrier a minimum 1\n1/2 inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the car. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground or station platform level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift platform is more than 3 inches above the station platform and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged. \n\n(6) Platform surface. The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over \n1/4 inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28\n1/2 inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1) \n\n(7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \n5/8 inch wide. When the lift is at car floor height with the inner barrier down (if applicable) or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and car floor shall not exceed \n1/2 inch horizontally and \n5/8 inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1\n1/2 inches by 4\n1/2 inches located between the edge barriers. \n\n(8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, when measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from station platform to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to \n1/4 inch. Thresholds between \n1/4 inch and \n1/2 inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. \n\n(9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform. \n\n(10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g. \n\n(11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids. \n\n(12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position. \n\n(13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\n1/4 inches and 1\n1/2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \n1/8 inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1\n1/2 inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car. \n\n(c) Car ramp or bridge plate—(1) Design load. Ramps or bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 300 pounds. \n\n(2) Ramp surface. The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than \n1/4 inch high, shall have a clear width of 30 inches and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel mobility aids. \n\n(3) Ramp threshold. The transition from station platform to the ramp or bridge plate and the transition from car floor to the ramp or bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to \n1/4 inch. Changes in level between \n1/4 inch and \n1/2 inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. \n\n(4) Ramp barriers. Each side of the ramp or bridge plate shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent mobility aid wheels from slipping off. \n\n(5) Slope. Ramps or bridge plates shall have the least slope practicable. If the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 3 inches or less above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 6 inches or less, but more than 3 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but more than 6 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:8 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is greater than 9 inches above the station platform a slope of 1:12 shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all structural requirements of this section. \n\n(6) Attachment—(i) Requirement. When in use for boarding or alighting, the ramp or bridge plate shall be attached to the vehicle, or otherwise prevented from moving such that it is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a heavy power mobility aid and that any gaps between vehicle and ramp or bridge plates, and station platform and ramp or bridge plate, shall not exceed \n5/8 inch. \n\n(ii) Exception. Ramps or bridge plates which are attached to, and deployed from, station platforms are permitted in lieu of car devices provided they meet the displacement requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section. \n\n(7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed ramps or bridge plates, including portable ramps or bridge plates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop. \n\n(8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons with disabilities to grasp them from outside the car while starting to board, and to continue to use them throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\n1/4 inches and 1\n1/2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \n1/8 inch. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car. \n\n(d) Mobility aid seating location. Spaces for persons who wish to remain in their wheelchairs or mobility aids shall have a minimum clear floor space 48 inches by 30 inches. Such spaces shall adjoin, and may overlap, an accessible path. Not more than 6 inches of the required clear floor space may be accommodated for footrests under another seat provided there is a minimum of 9 inches from the floor to the lowest part of the seat overhanging the space. Seating spaces may have fold-down or removable seats to accommodate other passengers when a wheelchair or mobility aid user is not occupying the area, provided the seats, when folded up, do not obstruct the clear floor space required.

All intercity rail cars, other than level entry cars, required to be accessible by § 1192.111 (a) and (e) of this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or other mobility aid user to reach a seating location complying with paragraph (d) of this section. \n\n(2) Exception. If portable or platform lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the applicable requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.113(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the car is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device. \n\n(b) Car Lift—(1) Design load. The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material. \n\n(2) Controls—(i) Requirements. The controls shall be interlocked with the car brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the car cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all platform levels normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position. \n\n(ii) Exception. Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the car axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the car axis and which pivots into or out of the car while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(iii) Exception. The brake or propulsion system interlocks requirement does not apply to platform mounted or portable lifts provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that cars do not move when the lift is in use. \n\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground or station platform level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and is intended to be stowed while occupied. \n\n(4) Power or equipment failure. Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, failing, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component. \n\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the car until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which, in its raised position, extends beyond the car shall have a barrier a minimum 1\n1/2 inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the car. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground or station platform level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift platform is more than 3 inches above the station platform and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged. \n\n(6) Platform surface. The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over \n1/4 inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28\n1/2 inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1.) \n\n(7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \n5/8 inch wide. When the lift is at car floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and car floor shall not exceed \n1/2 inch horizontally and \n5/8 inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1\n1/2 inches by 4\n1/2 inches located between the edge barriers. \n\n(8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, when measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from station platform to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to \n1/4 inch. Thresholds between \n1/4 inch and \n1/2 inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. \n\n(9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of car roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform. \n\n(10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g. \n\n(11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids. \n\n(12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position. \n\n(13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\n1/4 inches and 1\n1/2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \n1/8 inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1\n1/2 inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car. \n\n(c) Car ramp or bridge plate—(1) Design load. Ramps or bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 300 pounds. \n\n(2) Ramp surface. The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than \n1/4 inch high, shall have a clear width of 30 inches and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel mobility aids. \n\n(3) Ramp threshold. The transition from station platform to the ramp or bridge plate and the transition from car floor to the ramp or bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to \n1/4 inch. Changes in level between \n1/4 inch and \n1/2 inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. \n\n(4) Ramp barriers. Each side of the ramp or bridge plate shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent mobility aid wheels from slipping off. \n\n(5) Slope. Ramps or bridge plates shall have the least slope practicable. If the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 3 inches or less above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 6 inches or less, but more than 3 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but more than 6 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:8 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is greater than 9 inches above the station platform a slope of 1:12 shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all structural requirements of this section. \n\n(6) Attachment—(i) Requirement. When in use for boarding or alighting, the ramp or bridge plate shall be attached to the vehicle, or otherwise prevented from moving such that it is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a heavy power mobility aid and that any gaps between vehicle and ramp or bridge plate, and station platform and ramp or bridge plate, shall not exceed \n5/8 inch. \n\n(ii) Exception. Ramps or bridge plates which are attached to, and deployed from, station platforms are permitted in lieu of car devices provided they meet the displacement requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section. \n\n(7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed ramps or bridge plates, including portable ramps or bridge plates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop.\n\n(8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons with disabilities to grasp them from outside the car while starting to board, and to continue to use them throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\n1/4 inches and 1\n1/2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \n1/8 inch. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car. \n\n(d) Seating—(1) Requirements. All intercity rail cars required to be accessible by § 1192.111 (a) and (e) of this subpart shall provide at least one, but not more than two, mobility aid seating location(s) complying with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and at least one, but not more than two, seating location(s) complying with paragraph (d)(3) of this section which adjoin or overlap an accessible route with a minimum clear width of 32 inches. \n\n(2) Wheelchair or mobility aid spaces.

          "content": "§ 1201.17   What must I do to obtain a review of my debt, and how will the review process work?\n(a) Request for review. (1) You have the right to request a review by NARA of the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. If you want a review, you must send a written request to the NARA official designated in the notice (see § 1201.16(d)). \n\n(2) You must sign your request for review and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions. \n\n(3) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of NARA on or before the 60th calendar day following the date of the notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. NARA may consider requests filed after the 60-day period provided for in this section if you: \n\n(i) Can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control; or \n\n(ii) Did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline). \n\n(b) Inspection of NARA records related to the debt. (1) If you want to inspect or copy NARA records related to the debt (see § 1201.14(a)(5)), you must send a letter to the NARA official designated in the notice. Your letter must be received within 30 days of the date of the notice. \n\n(2) In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated NARA official will notify you of the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to the debt. \n\n(3) If personal inspection of NARA records related to the debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you copies of those records. \n\n(c) Review official. (1) When required by Federal law or regulation, such as in a salary offset situation, NARA will request an administrative law judge, or hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision (see paragraph (f) of this section for content of the review decision). \n\n(2) When Federal law or regulation does not require NARA to have the review conducted by an administrative law judge, or by a hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, NARA has the right to appoint a hearing official to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision (see paragraph (f) of this section for the content of the review decision). \n\n(d) Review procedure. If you request a review, the review official will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review official will determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the FCCS. Although you may request an oral hearing, such a hearing is required only when a review of the documentary evidence cannot determine the question of indebtedness, such as when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or truthfulness. In either case, the review official will conduct the review in accordance with the FCCS. If the review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing. \n\n(e) Date of decision. (1) The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing. This decision will be issued as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date on which NARA received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings. \n\n(2) If NARA is unable to issue a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for a hearing: \n\n(i) NARA may not issue a withholding order or take other action until the hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered; and \n\n(ii) If NARA previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, NARA must suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered. \n\n(f) Content of review decision. The review official will prepare a written decision that includes: \n\n(1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; \n\n(2) The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and \n\n(3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable. \n\n(g) Interest, penalty charge, and administrative cost accrual during review period. Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.",

          "content": "§ 1201.18   What interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will I have to pay on a debt owed to NARA?\n(a) Interest. (1) NARA will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract. \n\n(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. NARA will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. NARA will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of NARA or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. NARA will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of NARA. \n\n(3) The Archivist may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of NARA. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review. \n\n(b) Penalty. NARA will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. \n\n(c) Administrative costs. NARA will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of NARA. \n\n(d) Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal. \n\n(e) Additional authority. NARA may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority. \n\n(f) Waiver. (1) The Archivist may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of NARA. \n\n(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, and unless otherwise stated in these regulations, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Archivist's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.",

          "content": "§ 1201.19   How can I resolve my debt through voluntary repayment?\n(a) In response to a notice of debt, you may propose to NARA that you be allowed to repay the debt through a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of NARA taking other collection actions under this part. \n\n(b) Your request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement must: \n\n(1) Be in writing; \n\n(2) Admit the existence of the debt; and \n\n(3) Either propose payment of the debt (together with interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) in a lump sum, or set forth a proposed repayment schedule. \n\n(c) NARA will collect claims in one lump sum whenever feasible. However, if you are unable to pay your debt in one lump sum, NARA may accept payment in regular installments that bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and your ability to pay. \n\n(d) NARA will consider a request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement in accordance with the FCCS. The Archivist may request additional information from you, including financial statements if you request to make payments in installments, in order to determine whether to accept a voluntary repayment agreement. It is within the Archivist's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding with other collection actions under this part, and to set the necessary terms of any voluntary repayment agreement. No repayment agreement will be binding on NARA unless it is in writing and signed by both you and the Archivist. At NARA's option, you may be required to provide security as part of the agreement to make payments in installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 31 U.S.C. 3711 will govern any reduction or compromise of a claim.",

          "content": "§ 1201.32   What are NARA's procedures for salary offset?\n(a) NARA will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate. \n\n(b) If you are a NARA employee who owes a debt to NARA, NARA's payroll office will determine the amount of your disposable pay and will implement the salary offset. \n\n(c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by NARA's payroll office of certification of debt from the creditor agency. \n\n(d) The Notice provisions of these regulations do not apply to certain debts arising under this section (see § 1201.14(c)). \n\n(e) Types of collection. (1) Lump-sum offset. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset. \n\n(2) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and your ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless you have agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less. \n\n(3) Deductions from final check. A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily. \n\n(4) Deductions from other sources. If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from NARA and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, NARA may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS. \n\n(f) Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, NARA's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.",

          "content": "§ 1201.33   How will NARA coordinate salary offsets with other agencies?\n(a) Responsibilities of NARA as the creditor agency (i.e. when the debtor owes a debt to NARA and is an employee of another agency). Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716, NARA must submit a claim to a paying agency or disbursing official. \n\n(1) In its claim, NARA must certify, in writing, the following: \n\n(i) That the employee owes the debt; \n\n(ii) The amount and basis of the debt; \n\n(iii) The date NARA's right to collect the debt first accrued; \n\n(iv) That NARA's regulations in this subpart have been approved by OPM under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; and \n\n(v) That NARA has met the certification requirements of the paying agency. \n\n(2) If the collection must be made in installments, NARA's claim will also advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. NARA may also advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected and the date of the first installment, if that date is other than the next officially established pay period. \n\n(3) NARA will also include in its claim: \n\n(i) The employee's written consent to the salary offset; \n\n(ii) The employee's signed statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514; or \n\n(iii) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the actions taken and the dates of those actions. \n\n(4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, NARA must submit its claim to the paying agency or disbursing official for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency will (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and NARA. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal government sources, then (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, NARA must submit a properly certified claim under this paragraph (a)(4) to the agency responsible for making the other payments before the collection can be made. \n\n(5) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, NARA may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be administratively offset to collect the debt. \n\n(6) Employee transfer. When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, NARA will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. NARA will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency. \n\n(b) Responsibilities of NARA as the paying agency (i.e. when the debtor owes a debt to another agency and is an employee of NARA). (1) Complete claim. When NARA receives a certified claim from a creditor agency (under the creditor agency's regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, NARA sends the employee a written notice containing: \n\n(i) A statement that NARA has received a certified claim from the creditor agency; \n\n(ii) The amount of the claim; \n\n(iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin; and \n\n(iv) The amount of such deductions. \n\n(2) Incomplete claim. When NARA receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, NARA will return the claim with a notice that the creditor agency must: \n\n(i) Comply with the procedures required under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and \n\n(ii) Properly certify a claim to NARA before NARA will take action to collect from the employee's current pay account. \n\n(3) NARA is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency. \n\n(4) Employees who transfer from NARA to another paying agency. If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim to NARA, the employee transfers from NARA to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, NARA will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.",

If you are denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which you would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which you would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the record, NARA will make the record available to you, except for any information in the record that would disclose the identity of a confidential source as described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).\n\n(b) The systems described in paragraph (a) of this section are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (e)(4), (G) and (H), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:\n\n(1) From subsection (c)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because releasing disclosure accounting could alert the subject of an investigation about the alleged violations, about the existence of the investigation, and about the fact that they are being investigated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Insider Threat Office, or another agency. Releasing these records could provide significant information concerning the nature of the investigation and result in tampering with or destroying evidence, influencing witnesses, endangering individuals involved, and other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation.\n\n(2) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because access to the information contained in these systems of records could inform the subject of an investigation about an actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violation; about the existence of that investigation; about the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained on the person's activities; about the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and about information that may enable the person to avoid being detected or apprehended. These factors present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement when they prevent investigators from successfully completing the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, or lead to improperly influencing witnesses, destroying evidence, or fabricating testimony. In addition, granting access to such records could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Amending these records could allow the subject to avoid being detected or apprehended and interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities.\n\n(3) From subsection (e)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because applying this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of the OIG, the Insider Threat Office, or another agency for the following reasons:\n\n(i) It is not possible to detect relevance or need for specific information in the early stages of an investigation, case, or matter. After the investigators evaluate the information, they may establish its relevance and need.\n\n(ii) During an investigation, the investigating office may obtain information about other actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violations, including those outside the scope of its jurisdiction. The office should retain this information, as it may help establish patterns of inappropriate activity, and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.\n\n(iii) When interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, the investigator may receive information that relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may also relate to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another office or agency. The investigator cannot readily segregate such information.\n\n(4) From subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d), pursuant to subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.\n\n(5) From subsection (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.\n\n[81 FR 36802, June 8, 2016]",

The Commission ordinarily expects the applicant to provide cost sharing in an amount equal to the amount of the Federal grant award. Exceptions to the one-to-one cost sharing requirement may be set by the Commission in specific grant opportunity announcements.\n\n(2) Cost sharing may include cash or in-kind contributions provided by the applicant or by a non-Federal third party.\n\n(3) As indicated in 2 CFR part 2600, we do not pay indirect costs from grant funds, but allow indirect costs to be used for cost sharing.\n\n[71 FR 27624, May 12, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 66318, Oct. 28, 2010; 79 FR 76080, Dec. 19, 2014]",

Any person who believes himself or herself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by these Title IX regulations may by himself or herself or by a representative file with the designated agency official (or designee) a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the designated agency official (or designee). \n\n(c) Investigations. The designated agency official (or designee) will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with these Title IX regulations. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with these Title IX regulations occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with these Title IX regulations. \n\n(d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with these Title IX regulations, the designated agency official (or designee) will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible.

If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with these Title IX regulations, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with these Title IX regulations may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to: \n\n(1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or other contractual undertaking; and \n\n(2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law. \n\n(b) Noncompliance with § 1211.115. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to § 1211.115, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The agency shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under paragraph (c) of this section except that the agency shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to September 29, 2000. \n\n(c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. (1) No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until: \n\n(i) The designated agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; \n\n(ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations; and \n\n(iii) The expiration of 30 days after the Archivist has filed with the committee of the House, and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. \n\n(2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found. \n\n(d) Other means authorized by law. (1) No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until: \n\n(i) The designated agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; \n\n(ii) The recipient has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and \n\n(iii) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient. \n\n(2) During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient to comply with these Title IX regulations and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate. \n\n[65 FR 52887, Aug. 30, 2000]",

Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1211.615(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either: \n\n(1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or \n\n(2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 20 U.S.C. 1682 and § 1211.615(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record. \n\n(b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of the agency in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the designated agency official unless the official determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the agency requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556(b). \n\n(c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the agency shall have the right to be represented by counsel. \n\n(d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5 through 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the agency and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business. \n\n(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made. \n\n(e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with these Title IX regulations and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1211.625. \n\n[65 FR 52887, Aug. 30, 2000]",

After a hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing officer, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the agency may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. \n\n(b) Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority. Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. \n\n(c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1211.620, the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing officer for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any. \n\n(d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply. \n\n(e) Review in certain cases by the Archivist of the United States. If the Archivist has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for the agency may request the Archivist to review a decision of the reviewing authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Archivist determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Archivist may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The Archivist may also review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the National Archives and Records Administration. In the absence of a review under this paragraph (e), a final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall become the final decision of the agency when the Archivist transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under 20 U.S.C. 1682. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the reviewing authority or to request review under this paragraph (e) shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review. \n\n(f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which these Title IX regulations apply, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title IX and these Title IX regulations, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which these Title IX regulations apply will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to these Title IX regulations, or to have otherwise failed to comply with these Title IX regulations unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the designated agency official that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. \n\n(g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with these Title IX regulations and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. An elementary or secondary school or school system that is unable to file an assurance of compliance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation that meets the applicable requirements and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan. \n\n(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the designated agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the official shall restore such eligibility. \n\n(3) If the designated agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph (g) are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect. \n\n[65 FR 52888, Aug. 30, 2000]",

In this context, the term does not refer to misdirected materials. It may or may not refer to loaned or seized materials depending on the conditions under which such materials came into agency custody or were used by the agency. Advice of legal counsel should be sought regarding the “record” status of loaned or seized materials.\n\n(5) Preserved means the filing, storing, or any other method of systematically maintaining documentary materials in any medium by the agency. This term covers materials not only actually filed or otherwise systematically maintained but also those temporarily removed from existing filing systems.\n\n(6) Appropriate for preservation means documentary materials made or received which, in the judgment of the agency, should be filed, stored, or otherwise systematically maintained by an agency because of the evidence of agency activities or information they contain, even if the materials are not covered by its current filing or maintenance procedures.",

          "content": "§ 1222.12   What types of documentary materials are Federal records?\n(a) General. To ensure that complete and accurate records are made and retained in the Federal Government, agencies must distinguish between records and nonrecord materials by applying the definition of records (see 44 U.S.C. 3301 and 36 CFR 1220.18 and 1222.10 of this subchapter) to agency documentary materials in all formats and media.\n\n(b) Record status. Documentary materials are records when they meet the conditions specified in § 1222.10(b).\n\n(c) Working files and similar materials. Working files, such as preliminary drafts and rough notes, and other similar materials, are records that must be maintained to ensure adequate and proper documentation if:\n\n(1) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, for official purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to communicate with agency staff about agency business; and\n\n(2) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments that adds to a proper understanding of the agency's formulation and execution of basic policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities.\n\n(d) Record status of copies. The determination as to whether a particular document is a record does not depend upon whether it contains unique information. Multiple copies of the same document and documents containing duplicative information may each have record status depending on how they are used in conducting agency business.",

Agencies must specify in the contract Government ownership and the delivery to the Government of all records necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of contractor-operated agency activities and programs in accordance with requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-400), as amended by Pub. L. 96-83 41 U.S.C.), and, where applicable, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (48 CFR parts 200-299).\n\n(2) Records management oversight of contract records is necessary to ensure that all recordkeeping needs are met. All records created for Government use and delivered to, or under the legal control of, the Government must be managed in accordance with Federal law. In addition, electronic records and background electronic data specified for delivery to the contracting agency must be accompanied by sufficient technical documentation to permit understanding and use of the records and data.\n\n(3) Contracts that require the creation of data for the Government's use must specify, in addition to the final product, delivery of background supporting data or other records that may have reuse value to the Government. To determine what background supporting data or other records that contractors must deliver, program and contracting officials must consult with agency records and information managers and historians and, when appropriate, with other Government agencies to ensure that all Government needs are met, especially when the data deliverables support a new agency mission or a new Government program.\n\n(4) Deferred ordering and delivery-of-data clauses and rights-in-data clauses must be included in contracts whenever necessary to ensure adequate and proper documentation or because the data have reuse value to the Government.\n\n(b) All data created for Government use and delivered to, or falling under the legal control of, the Government are Federal records subject to the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapters 21, 29, 31, and 33, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended, and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, and must be managed and scheduled for disposition only as provided in Subchapter B.\n\n(c) Agencies must ensure that appropriate authority for retention of classified materials has been granted to contractors or non-Government entities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), established under Executive order 12829, as amended, or a successor Order.",

          "content": "§ 1234.10   What are the facility requirements for all records storage facilities?\n(a) The facility must be constructed with non-combustible materials and building elements, including walls, columns and floors. There are two exceptions to this requirement:\n\n(1) Roof elements may be constructed with combustible materials if installed in accordance with local building codes and if roof elements are protected by a properly installed, properly maintained wet-pipe automatic sprinkler system, as specified in NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(2) An agency may request a waiver of the requirement specified in paragraph (a) from NARA for an existing records storage facility with combustible building elements to continue to operate until October 1, 2009. In its request for a waiver, the agency must provide documentation that the facility has a fire suppression system specifically designed to mitigate this hazard and that the system meets the requirements of § 1234.12(s). Submit waiver requests to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.\n\n(b) A facility with two or more stories must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer and civil/structural engineer to avoid catastrophic failure of the structure due to an uncontrolled fire on one of the intermediate floor levels. For new buildings the seals on the construction drawings serve as proof of this review. For existing buildings, this requirement may be demonstrated by a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed fire protection engineer that the fire resistance of the separating floor(s) is/(are) at least four hours, and a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed civil/structural engineer that there are no obvious structural weaknesses that would indicate a high potential for structural catastrophic collapse under fire conditions.\n\n(c) The building must be sited a minimum of five feet above and 100 feet from any 100 year flood plain areas, or be protected by an appropriate flood wall that conforms to local or regional building codes.\n\n(d) The facility must be designed in accordance with the applicable national, regional, state, or local building codes (whichever is most stringent) to provide protection from building collapse or failure of essential equipment from earthquake hazards, tornadoes, hurricanes and other potential natural disasters.\n\n(e) Roads, fire lanes and parking areas must permit unrestricted access for emergency vehicles.\n\n(f) A floor load limit must be established for the records storage area by a licensed structural engineer. The limit must take into consideration the height and type of the shelving or storage equipment, the width of the aisles, the configuration of the space, etc. The allowable load limit must be posted in a conspicuous place and must not be exceeded.\n\n(g) The facility must ensure that the roof membrane does not permit water to penetrate the roof. NARA strongly recommends that this requirement be met by not mounting equipment on the roof and placing nothing else on the roof that may cause damage to the roof membrane. Alternatively, a facility may meet this requirement with stringent design specifications for roof-mounted equipment in conjunction with a periodic roof inspection program performed by appropriately certified professionals.\n\n(1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) beginning on September 28, 2005.\n\n(2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) no later than October 1, 2009.\n\n(h) Piping (with the exception of fire protection sprinkler piping and storm water roof drainage piping) must not be run through records storage areas unless supplemental measures such as gutters or shields are used to prevent water leaks and the piping assembly is inspected for potential leaks regularly. If drainage piping from roof drains must be run though records storage areas, the piping must be run to the nearest vertical riser and must include a continuous gutter sized and installed beneath the lateral runs to prevent leakage into the storage area. Vertical pipe risers required to be installed in records storage areas must be fully enclosed by shaft construction with appropriate maintenance access panels.\n\n(1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) beginning on September 28, 2005.\n\n(2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) no later than October 1, 2009.\n\n(i) The following standards apply to records storage shelving and racking systems:\n\n(1) All storage shelving and racking systems must be designed and installed to provide seismic bracing that meets the requirements of the applicable state, regional, and local building code (whichever is most stringent);\n\n(2) Racking systems, steel shelving, or other open-shelf records storage equipment must be braced to prevent collapse under full load. Each racking system or shelving unit must be industrial style shelving rated at least 50 pounds per cubic foot supported by the shelf;\n\n(3) Compact mobile shelving systems (if used) must be designed to permit proper air circulation and fire protection. Request detailed specifications that meet this requirement from NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.\n\n(j) The area occupied by the records storage facility must be equipped with an anti-intrusion alarm system, or equivalent, meeting the requirements of UL 1076 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), level AA, to protect against unlawful entry after hours and to monitor designated interior storage spaces. This intrusion alarm system must be monitored in accordance with UL 611, (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(k) The facility must comply with the requirements for a Level III facility as defined in the Department of Justice, U. S. Marshals Service report Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities dated June 28, 1995. These requirements are provided in Appendix A to this part 1234. Agencies may require compliance with Level IV or Level V facility security requirements if the facility is classified at the higher level.\n\n(l) Records contaminated by hazardous materials, such as radioactive isotopes or toxins, infiltrated by insects, or exhibiting active mold growth must be stored in separate areas having separate air handling systems from other records.\n\n(m) To eliminate damage to records and/or loss of information due to insects, rodents, mold and other pests that are attracted to organic materials under specific environmental conditions, the facility must have an Integrated Pest Management program as defined in the Food Protection Act of 1996 (Section 303, Pub. L. 104-170, 110 Stat. 1512). This states in part that Integrated Pest Management is a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks. The IPM program emphasizes three fundamental elements:\n\n(1) Prevention. IPM is a preventive maintenance process that seeks to identify and eliminate potential pest access, shelter, and nourishment. It also continually monitors for pests themselves, so that small infestations do not become large ones;\n\n(2) Least-toxic methods. IPM aims to minimize both pesticide use and risk through alternate control techniques and by favoring compounds, formulations, and application methods that present the lowest potential hazard to humans and the environment; and\n\n(3) Systems approach. The IPM pest control contract must be effectively coordinated with all other relevant programs that operate in and around a building, including plans and procedures involving design and construction, repairs and alterations, cleaning, waste management, food service, and other activities.\n\n(n) For new records storage facilities only, the additional requirements in this paragraph (n) must be met:\n\n(1) Do not install mechanical equipment, excluding material handling and conveyance equipment that have operating thermal breakers on the motor, containing motors rated in excess of 1 HP within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).\n\n(2) Do not install high-voltage electrical distribution equipment (i.e., 13.2kv or higher switchgear and transformers) within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).\n\n(3) A redundant source of primary electric service such as a second primary service feeder should be provided to ensure continuous, dependable service to the facility especially to the HVAC systems, fire alarm and fire protection systems. Manual switching between sources of service is acceptable.\n\n(4) A facility storing permanent records must be kept under positive air pressure, especially in the area of the loading dock. In addition, to prevent fumes from vehicle exhausts from entering the facility, air intake louvers must not be located in the area of the loading dock, adjacent to parking areas, or in any location where a vehicle engine may be running for any period of time. Loading docks must have an air supply and exhaust system that is separate from the remainder of the facility.\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13655, Mar. 30, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1234.12   What are the fire safety requirements that apply to records storage facilities?\n(a) The fire detection and protection systems must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer. If the system was not designed by a licensed fire protection engineer, the review requirement is met by furnishing a report under the seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that describes the design intent of the fire detection and suppression system, detailing the characteristics of the system, and describing the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by code that have been incorporated to minimize loss. The report should make specific reference to appropriate industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.\n\n(b) All interior walls separating records storage areas from each other and from other storage areas in the building must be at least three-hour fire barrier walls. A records storage facility may not store more than 250,000 cubic feet total of Federal records in a single records storage area. When Federal records are combined with other records in a single records storage area, only the Federal records will apply toward this limitation.\n\n(c) Fire barrier walls that meet the following specifications must be provided:\n\n(1) For existing records storage facilities, at least one-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces.\n\n(2) For new records storage facilities, two-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces. One exterior wall of each stack area must be designed with a maximum fire resistive rating of one hour, or, if rated more than one hour, there must be at least one knock-out panel in one exterior wall of each stack area.\n\n(d) Penetrations in the walls must not reduce the specified fire resistance ratings. The fire resistance ratings of structural elements and construction assemblies must be in accordance with ASTM E 119-98 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(e) The fire resistive rating of the roof must be a minimum of \n1/2 hour for all records storage facilities, or must be protected by an automatic sprinkler system designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(f) Openings in fire barrier walls separating records storage areas must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. If openings are necessary, they must be protected by self-closing or automatic Class A fire doors, or equivalent doors that maintain the same rating as the wall.\n\n(g) Roof support structures that cross or penetrate fire barrier walls must be cut and supported independently on each side of the fire barrier wall.\n\n(h) If fire barrier walls are erected with expansion joints, the joints must be protected to their full height.\n\n(i) Building columns in the records storage areas must be at least 1-hour fire resistant or protected in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(j) Automatic roof vents for routine ventilation purposes must not be designed into new records storage facilities. Automatic roof vents, designed solely to vent in the case of a fire, with a temperature rating at least twice that of the sprinkler heads are acceptable.\n\n(k) Where lightweight steel roof or floor supporting members (e.g., bar joists having top chords with angles 2 by 12 inches or smaller, 1/4-inch thick or smaller, and 13/16-inch or smaller Web diameters) are present, they must be protected either by applying a 10-minute fire resistive coating to the top chords of the joists, or by retrofitting the sprinkler system with large drop sprinkler heads. If a fire resistive coating is applied, it must be a product that will not release (off gas) harmful fumes into the facility. If fire resistive coating is subject to air erosion or flaking, it must be fully enclosed in a drywall containment constructed of metal studs with fire retardant drywall. Retrofitting may require modifications to the piping system to ensure that adequate water capacity and pressure are provided in the areas to be protected with these large drop sprinkler heads.\n\n(l) Open flame (oil or gas) unit heaters or equipment, if used in records storage areas, must be installed or used in the records storage area in accordance with NFPA 54 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and the IAPMO/ANSI UMC 1, Uniform Mechanical Code (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(m) For existing records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 2-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.\n\n(n) For new records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 4-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.\n\n(o) For new records storage facilities, fuel supply lines must not be installed in areas containing records and must be separated from such areas with 4-hour rated construction assemblies.\n\n(p) Equipment rows running perpendicular to the wall must comply with NFPA 101 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), with respect to egress requirements.\n\n(q) No oil-type electrical transformers, regardless of size, except thermally protected devices included in fluorescent light ballasts, may be installed in the records storage areas. All electrical wiring must be in metal conduit, except that armored cable may be used where flexible wiring connections to light fixtures are required. Battery charging areas for electric forklifts must be separated from records storage areas with at least a 2-hour rated fire barrier wall.\n\n(r) Hazardous materials, including records on cellulose nitrate film, must not be stored in records storage areas. Nitrate motion picture film and nitrate sheet film may be stored in separate areas that meet the requirements of the appropriate NFPA standards, NFPA 40-1997 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), or NFPA 42 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(s) All record storage and adjoining areas must be protected by a professionally-designed fire-safety detection and suppression system that is designed to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 ounces of accelerant to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of records destroyed by fire. Section 1234.32 specifies how to document compliance with this requirement.",

          "content": "§ 1234.14   What are the requirements for environmental controls for records storage facilities?\n(a) Paper-based temporary records. Paper-based temporary records must be stored under environmental conditions that prevent the active growth of mold. Exposure to moisture through leaks or condensation, relative humidities in excess of 70%, extremes of heat combined with relative humidity in excess of 55%, and poor air circulation during periods of elevated heat and relative humidity are all factors that contribute to mold growth.\n\n(b) Nontextual temporary records. Nontextual temporary records, including microforms and audiovisual and electronic records, must be stored in records storage space that is designed to preserve them for their full retention period. New records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) no later than October 1, 2009. At a minimum, nontextual temporary records must be stored in records storage space that meets the requirements for medium term storage set by the appropriate standard in this paragraph (b). In general, medium term conditions as defined by these standards are those that will ensure the preservation of the materials for at least 10 years with little information degradation or loss. Records may continue to be usable for longer than 10 years when stored under these conditions, but with an increasing risk of information loss or degradation with longer times. If temporary records require retention longer than 10 years, better storage conditions (cooler and drier) than those specified for medium term storage will be needed to maintain the usability of these records. The applicable standards are:\n\n(1) ANSI/PIMA IT9.11 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);\n\n(2) ANSI/NAPM IT9.23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);\n\n(3) ANSI/PIMA IT9.25 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);\n\n(4) ANSI/NAPM IT9.20 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3); and/or\n\n(5) ANSI/NAPM IT9.18 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).\n\n(c) Paper-based permanent, unscheduled and sample/select records. Paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and sample/select records must be stored in records storage space that provides 24 hour/365 days per year air conditioning (temperature, humidity, and air exchange) equivalent to that required for office space. See ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and ASHRAE Standard 62 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), for specific requirements. New records storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) no later than October 1, 2009.\n\n(d) Nontextual permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records. All records storage facilities that store microfilm, audiovisual, and/or electronic permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must comply with the storage standards for permanent and unscheduled records in parts 1238, 1237, and/or 1236 of this subchapter, respectively.",

NARA will review the agency's waiver request and plan to bring the facility into compliance.\n\n(1) NARA will approve the request and plan within 30 calendar days if NARA judges the planned actions and time frames for bringing the facility into compliance are reasonable.\n\n(2) If NARA questions the feasibility or reasonableness of the plan, NARA will work with the agency to develop a revised plan that NARA can approve and the agency can implement. NARA may grant a short-term temporary waiver, not to exceed 180 calendar days, while the revised plan is under development.\n\n(c) Waiver of roof requirements for underground storage facilities. NARA will normally grant the waiver and notify the requesting agency within 10 work days if the agency has not also requested a waiver of a different requirement under § 1234.30. If the agency has another waiver request pending for the same facility, NARA will respond to all of the waiver requests at the same time and within the longest time limits.",

          "content": "§ 1234.30   How does an agency request authority to establish or relocate records storage facilities?\n(a) General policy. Agencies are responsible for ensuring that records in their legal custody are stored in appropriate space as outlined in this part. Under § 1232.18(a), agencies are responsible for initiating action to remove records from space that does not meet these standards if deficiencies are not corrected within 6 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies by NARA or the agency and to complete removal of the records within 18 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies.\n\n(1) Agency records centers. Agencies must obtain prior written approval from NARA before establishing or relocating an agency records center. Each separate agency records center must be specifically approved by NARA prior to the transfer of any records to that individual facility. If an agency records center has been approved for the storage of Federal records of one agency, any other agency that proposes to store its records in that facility must still obtain NARA approval to do so.\n\n(2) Commercial records storage facilities. An agency may contract for commercial records storage services. However, before any agency records are transferred to a commercial records storage facility, the transferring agency must ensure that the facility meets all of the requirements for an agency records storage facility set forth in this subpart and must submit the documentation required in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(b) Exclusions. For purposes of this section, the term “agency records center” excludes NARA-owned and operated records centers. For purposes of this section and § 1234.34, the term “agency records center” also excludes agency records staging and/or holding areas with a capacity for containing less than 25,000 cubic feet of records. However, such records centers and areas, including records centers operated and maintained by NARA, must comply with the facility standards in §§ 1234.10 through 1234.14.\n\n(c) Content of requests for agency records centers. Submit requests for authority to establish or relocate an agency records center, or to use an agency records center operated by another agency, to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The request must identify the specific facility and, for requests to establish or relocate the agency's own records center, document compliance with the standards in this subpart. Documentation requirements for § 1234.12(s) are specified in § 1234.32.\n\n(d) Approval of requests for agency records centers. NARA will review the submitted documentation to ensure the facility demonstrates full compliance with the standards in this subpart. NARA reserves the right to visit the facility, if necessary, to make the determination of compliance. NARA will inform the agency of its decision within 45 calendar days after the request is received, and will provide the agency information on the areas of noncompliance if the request is denied. Requests will be denied only if NARA determines that the facility does not demonstrate full compliance with the standards in this subpart. Approvals will be valid for a period of 10 years, unless the facility is materially changed before then or an agency or NARA inspection finds that the facility does not meet the standards in this subpart. Material changes require submission of a new request for NARA approval.\n\n(e) Documentation requirements for storing Federal records in commercial records storage facilities. At least 45 calendar days before an agency first transfers records to a commercial records storage facility, the agency must submit documentation to NARA that the facility complies with the standards in this subpart.\n\n The documentation may take the form of a copy of the agency's contract that incorporates this subpart in its provisions or a statement from the agency records officer that certifies that the facility meets the standards in this subpart. \n\nAn agency must provide the documentation for each separate commercial records storage facility where its records will be stored.\n\nSend documentation to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The agency must submit updated documentation to NARA every 10 years if it continues to store records in that commercial records storage facility.\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13655, Mar. 30, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1234.32   What does an agency have to do to certify a fire-safety detection and suppression system?\n(a) Content of documentation. The agency must submit documentation to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, that describes the space being protected (e.g., the type and stacking height of the storage equipment used, or how the space is designed, controlled, and operated) and the characteristics of the fire-safety detection and suppression system used. The documentation must demonstrate how that system meets the requirement in § 1234.12(s) through:\n\n(1) A statement that the facility is using a NARA certified system as described in Appendix B to this part;\n\n(2) A report of the results of independent live fire testing (Factory Mutual, Underwriters Laboratories or Southwest Research Institute); or\n\n(3) A report under seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that:\n\n(i) Describes the design intent of the fire suppression system to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 fluid ounces of petroleum-type hydrocarbon accelerant (such as, for example, heptanes or gasoline) to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of Federal records destroyed by fire. The report need not predict a maximum single event loss at any specific number, but rather should describe the design intent of the fire suppression system. The report may make reasonable engineering and other assumptions such as that the fire department responds within XX minutes (the local fire department's average response time) and promptly commences suppression actions. In addition, any report prepared under this paragraph should assume that the accelerant is saturated in a cotton wick that is 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches long and sealed in a plastic bag and that the fire is started in an aisle at the face of a carton at floor level. Assumptions must be noted in the report;\n\n(ii) Details the characteristics of the system; and\n\n(iii) Describes the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by the applicable building code that have been incorporated to limit destruction of records. The report should make specific references to industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.\n\n(b) NARA action. (1) NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 10 work days if NARA has previously approved the system design for similarly configured space or if a report of independent testing of a new system design is furnished as documentation.\n\n(2) If, in NARA's judgment, the supporting documentation provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section clearly demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 30 calendar days.\n\n(3) If NARA questions whether supporting documentation demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will consult the appropriate industry standards body or other qualified expert before making a determination. Before any consultation, NARA may ask the agency for additional clarifying information. NARA will notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request that consultation is necessary and will provide a final determination within 60 calendar days. If NARA does not approve the system, NARA will furnish a full explanation of the reasons for its decision.\n\n(4) NARA will maintain a list of approved alternative systems.\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13656, Mar. 30, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1235.46   What electronic media may be used for transferring records to the National Archives of the United States?\n(a) General. This section specifies the media or method used to transfer permanent records to the National Archives of the United States. (See 36 CFR 1236.28 for the requirements governing the selection of electronic records storage media for current agency use.) The agency must use only media that is are sound and free from defects for transfers to the National Archives of the United States. When permanent electronic records may be disseminated through multiple electronic media (e.g., magnetic tape, CD-ROM) or mechanisms (e.g., FTP), the agency and NARA must agree on the most appropriate medium or method for transfer of the records into the National Archives of the United States.\n\n(b) Magnetic tape. Agencies may transfer electronic records to the National Archives of the United States on magnetic tape as follows:\n\n(1) Open-reel magnetic tape must be on \n1/2-inch 9-track tape reels recorded at 1600 or 6250 bpi that meet ANSI X3.39 or ANSI X3.54 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4), respectively.\n\n(2) 18-track 3480-class cartridges must be recorded at 37,871 bpi that meet ANSI X3.180 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4). The data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block.\n\n(3) For DLT tape IV cartridges, the data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block and must conform to the standards cited in the table as follows:\n\nIf you are copying the records on . . .\n . . . then, the standard below applies.\nDLTtape IV with a DLT 4000 drive . . .ISO/IEC 15307 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4).\nDLTtape IV with a DLT 7000 drive . . .ISO/IEC 15896 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4).\nDLTtape IV with a DLT 8000 drive . . .ISO/IEC 16382 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4).\n(c) Compact-Disk, Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) and Digital Video Disks (DVDs). Agencies may use CD-ROMs and DVDs to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives of the United States.\n\n(1) CD-ROMs used for this purpose must conform to ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).\n\n(2) Permanent electronic records must be stored in discrete files. Transferred CD-ROMs and DVDs may contain other files, such as software or temporary records, but all permanent records must be in files that contain only permanent records. Agencies must indicate at the time of transfer if a CD-ROM or DVD contains temporary records and where those records are located on the CD-ROM or DVD. The agency must also specify whether NARA should return the CD-ROM or DVD to the agency or dispose of it after copying the permanent records to an archival medium.\n\n(3) If permanent electronic records are stored on both CD-ROM (or DVD) and other media, such as magnetic tape, the agency and NARA must agree on the medium that will be used to transfer the records into the National Archives of the United States.\n\n(d) File Transfer Protocol. Agencies may use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives of the United States only with NARA's approval. Several important factors may limit the use of FTP as a transfer method, including the number of records, record file size, and available bandwidth. Agencies must contact NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at stillpix.accessions@nara.gov (for digital photographs) or mopix.accessions@nara.gov (for electronic audiovisual records). For all other electronic records formats, contact NARA to initiate the transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at etransfers@nara.gov. Each transfer of electronic records via FTP must be preceded with a signed SF 258 sent to RDE.\n\n(1) FTP file structure may use the 64-character Joliet extension naming convention only when letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (___) are used in the file and/or directory names, with a slash (/) used to indicate directory structures. Otherwise, FTP file structure must conform to an 8.3 file naming convention and file directory structure as cited in ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).\n\n(2) Permanent electronic records must be transferred in discrete files, separate from temporary files. All permanent records must be transferred in files that contain only permanent records.\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13656, Mar. 30, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1235.50   What specifications and standards for transfer apply to electronic records?\n(a) General. (1) Agencies must transfer electronic records in a format that is independent of specific hardware or software. Except as specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the records must be written in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) with all control characters and other non-data characters removed. Consult NARA about electronic records in other formats, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at etransfers@nara.gov.\n\n(2) Agencies must have advance approval from NARA for compression of the records, and agencies must comply with a request from NARA to provide the software to decompress the records.\n\n(3) Agencies interested in transferring scheduled electronic records using a Tape Archive (TAR) utility must contact NARA to initiate transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at etransfers@nara.gov.\n\n(b) Data files and databases. Data files and databases must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States as flat files or as rectangular tables; i.e., as two-dimensional arrays, lists, or tables. All “records” (within the context of the computer program, as opposed to a Federal record) or “tuples,” i.e., ordered collections of data items, within a file or table must have the same logical format. Each data element within a record must contain only one data value. A record must not contain nested repeating groups of data items. The file must not contain extraneous control characters, except record length indicators for variable length records, or marks delimiting a data element, field, record, or file. If records or data elements in different files need to be linked or combined, then each record must contain one or more data elements that constitute primary and/or foreign keys enabling valid linkages between the related records in separate files.\n\n(c) Digital geospatial data files. Digital spatial data files must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States in a format that complies with a non-proprietary, published open standard maintained by or for a Federal, national, or international standards organization. Acceptable transfer formats include the Geography Markup Language (GML) as defined by the Open GIS Consortium.\n\n(d) Textual documents. Electronic textual documents must be transferred as plain ASCII files; however, such files may contain standard markup language such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or XML tags.\n\n(e) Electronic mail, scanned images of textual records, portable document format records, digital photographic records, and web content records. For guidance on transferring these records to NARA, agencies should consult the transfer requirements available online at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html or upon request from NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at etransfers@nara.gov.\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 83 FR 13657, Mar. 30, 2018]",

          "content": "§ 1236.2   Definitions that apply to this part.\n(a) See § 1220.18 of this subchapter for definitions of terms used throughout Subchapter B, including part 1236.\n\n(b) As used in part 1236—\n\nAdministrative metadata are elements of information used to manage records and relate them to one another. Administrative metadata elements describe how a record was created, any access and use restrictions that apply to it, information about the record series to which it belongs, and the disposition schedule that identifies its retention period.\n\nChecksum is a value that is computed on data and is used to authenticate information by indicating when a file has been corrupted or modified. This value is also called a “hash value,” “hash code,” “digest,” or simply “hash.”\n\nDescriptive metadata are elements of information that describe the records or set of records itself. They apply to both the source records and any versions produced through digitization. Descriptive metadata for individual source records include such elements as the title of a record, a description of its contents, its creator, and the date it was created. These elements support searching for and discovering records.\n\n\n\nDigitizing is the process of converting paper or analog records into electronic records.\n\nElectronic information system means an information system that contains and provides access to computerized Federal records and other information.\n\nElectronic mail system means a computer application used to create, receive, and transmit messages and other documents. Excluded from this definition are file transfer utilities (software that transmits files between users but does not retain any transmission data), data systems used to collect and process data that have been organized into data files or data bases on either personal computers or mainframe computers, and word processing documents not transmitted on an e-mail system.\n\nEmbedded metadata are textual components that exist alongside the content (usually binary data) within the file. Embedded metadata may be used to make self-describing digital files that contain administrative rights, and technical metadata and can be appropriately managed outside of a recordkeeping system.\n\nIntellectual control is the information necessary to identify and understand the content and context of the records.\n\nMedia are the physical forms on which records are stored, such as paper, photographs, compact discs, DVDs, analog tapes, flash drives, local hard drives, or servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata consists of preserved contextual information describing the history, tracking, and/or management of an electronic document.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed-media files are records in different forms of media. A file, when used in the phrase “mixed-media file,” is a group of records—regardless of location and type of media—that belong together or relate to a topic. For example, a mixed-media case file could be a box with paper notes, audio recordings of interviews, and a CD of photographs, along with physical evidence stored separately in an evidence locker. Records in a file may be in more than one media type because of how agencies create, maintain, and use records, shifts in technology, and the topic or activity involved.\n\nPhysical characteristics of source records include the media, the method that information is recorded, the physical condition of the material, and the smallest level of detail present. The physical characteristics of records printed on paper include: the type of paper (office paper, Thermofax, photographic print); the type of printing (laser printed, fax printed, typewritten, half-toned, handwritten); appearance (color, inks, continuous tone or monochrome images); size, and other methods of conveying information (embossed seals, stamps). These traits determine the methods and equipment used to digitize records.\n\nPhysical control is having the information necessary to physically manage records. This includes knowing where the records are housed, whether any records are missing or stored separately, and the records' physical form (media types, the records' dimensions, and the physical characteristics).\n\nProject plan is a document that identifies the records that are to be digitized, an estimate of their volume and of the media types that are present, the image quality parameters selected to capture necessary information, the date range of the records, a copy of the applicable agency records schedule(s); any indexes used to maintain intellectual and physical control; and a quality management (QM) section that describes quality assurance (QA) objectives, quality control (QC) procedures to identify and correct errors during digitization, and the QC reports that will be used to identify and remediate errors when detected.\n\nQuality assurance (QA) refers to proactive QM activities focused on preventing defects by ensuring that a particular product or service achieves certain requirements or specifications. A QA program is heavily dependent on QC data to search for patterns and trends. QA activities also include controlled experiments, design reviews of digitization workflows, and system tests. QA programs can improve quality by creating plans and policies or by creating and conducting training.\n\nQuality control (QC) refers to QM activities that examine products through inspection or testing to determine if they meet predetermined specifications. The purpose is to detect defects (deviations from predetermined requirements) in products or processes.\n\nQuality management (QM) refers to the overall management functions and underlying activities that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities, and that implement them through planning, control, assurance, and improvement methods within the quality system.\n\nTechnical metadata are elements of information that describe the properties of computer files, the hardware used to create them, and the parameters used by systems to render them. Technical metadata may include elements such as a file's byte size, file format and version, color encoding, and the type of equipment used to make the file (for example, camera name or scanner manufacturer).\n\n\n\nUnstructured electronic records means records created using office automation applications such as electronic mail and other messaging applications, word processing, or presentation software.\n\nValidating is the process of ensuring that the records meet the requirements of this part.\n\n\n\n[74 FR 51014, Oct. 2, 2009, as amended at 84 FR 14266, Apr. 10, 2019; 88 FR 28416, May 4, 2023]",

To successfully protect records against technological obsolescence, agencies must:\n\n(a) Determine if the NARA-approved retention period for the records will be longer than the life of the system where they are currently stored. If so, plan for the migration of the records to a new system before the current system is retired.\n\n(b) Carry out upgrades of hardware and software in such a way as to retain the functionality and integrity of the electronic records created in them. Retention of record functionality and integrity requires:\n\n(1) Retaining the records in a usable format until their authorized disposition date. Where migration includes conversion of records, ensure that the authorized disposition of the records can be implemented after conversion;\n\n(2) Any necessary conversion of storage media to provide compatibility with current hardware and software; and\n\n(3) Maintaining a link between records and their metadata through conversion or migration, including capture of all relevant associated metadata at the point of migration (for both the records and the migration process).\n\n(c) Ensure that migration strategies address non-active electronic records that are stored off-line.",

Agencies must use electronic or paper recordkeeping systems or a combination of those systems, depending on their business needs, for managing their records. Transitory e-mail may be managed as specified in § 1236.22(c).\n\n(b) Electronic recordkeeping. Recordkeeping functionality may be built into the electronic information system or records can be transferred to an electronic recordkeeping repository, such as a DoD-5015.2 STD-certified product. The following functionalities are necessary for electronic recordkeeping:\n\n(1) Declare records. Assign unique identifiers to records.\n\n(2) Capture records. Import records from other sources, manually enter records into the system, or link records to other systems.\n\n(3) Organize records. Associate with an approved records schedule and disposition instruction.\n\n(4) Maintain records security. Prevent the unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of declared records, and ensure that appropriate audit trails are in place to track use of the records.\n\n(5) Manage access and retrieval. Establish the appropriate rights for users to access the records and facilitate the search and retrieval of records.\n\n(6) Preserve records. Ensure that all records in the system are retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct agency business and to meet NARA-approved dispositions. Agencies must develop procedures to enable the migration of records and their associated metadata to new storage media or formats in order to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence.\n\n(7) Execute disposition. Identify and effect the transfer of permanent records to NARA based on approved records schedules. Identify and delete temporary records that are eligible for disposal. Apply records hold or freeze on disposition when required.\n\n(c) Backup systems. System and file backup processes and media do not provide the appropriate recordkeeping functionalities and must not be used as the agency electronic recordkeeping system.",

The agency may determine that other metadata is needed to meet agency business needs, e.g., receipt information.\n\n(2) Attachments to electronic mail messages that are an integral part of the record must be preserved as part of the electronic mail record or linked to the electronic mail record with other related records.\n\n(3) If the electronic mail system identifies users by codes or nicknames or identifies addressees only by the name of a distribution list, retain the intelligent or full names on directories or distributions lists to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records.\n\n(4) Some e-mail systems provide calendars and task lists for users. These may meet the definition of Federal record. Calendars that meet the definition of Federal records are to be managed in accordance with the provisions of GRS 23, Item 5.\n\n(5) Draft documents that are circulated on electronic mail systems may be records if they meet the criteria specified in 36 CFR 1222.10(b) of this subchapter.\n\n(b) Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\n\n(c) Agencies may elect to manage electronic mail records with very short-term NARA-approved retention periods (transitory records with a very short-term retention period of 180 days or less as provided by GRS 23, Item 7, or by a NARA-approved agency records schedule) on the electronic mail system itself, without the need to copy the record to a paper or electronic recordkeeping system, provided that:\n\n(1) Users do not delete the messages before the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period, and\n\n(2) The system's automatic deletion rules ensure preservation of the records until the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period.\n\n(d) Except for those electronic mail records within the scope of paragraph (c) of this section:\n\n(1) Agencies must not use an electronic mail system to store the recordkeeping copy of electronic mail messages identified as Federal records unless that system has all of the features specified in § 1236.20(b) of this part.\n\n(2) If the electronic mail system is not designed to be a recordkeeping system, agencies must instruct staff on how to copy Federal records from the electronic mail system to a recordkeeping system.\n\n(e) Agencies that retain permanent electronic mail records scheduled for transfer to the National Archives must either store them in a format and on a medium that conforms to the requirements concerning transfer at 36 CFR part 1235 or maintain the ability to convert the records to the required format and medium at the time transfer is scheduled.\n\n(f) Agencies that maintain paper recordkeeping systems must print and file their electronic mail records with the related transmission and receipt data specified by the agency's electronic mail instructions.",

This test should verify that the magnetic computer tape media are free of permanent errors and in compliance with NIST or industry standards.\n\n(e) Agencies must annually read a statistical sample of all magnetic computer tape media containing permanent and unscheduled records to identify any loss of data and to discover and correct the causes of data loss. In magnetic computer tape libraries with 1800 or fewer tape media, a 20% sample or a sample size of 50 media, whichever is larger, should be read. In magnetic computer tape libraries with more than 1800 media, a sample of 384 media should be read. Magnetic computer tape media with 10 or more errors should be replaced and, when possible, lost data must be restored. All other magnetic computer tape media which might have been affected by the same cause (i.e., poor quality tape, high usage, poor environment, improper handling) must be read and corrected as appropriate.\n\n(f) Before the media are 10 years old, agencies must copy permanent or unscheduled data on magnetic records storage media onto tested and verified new electronic media.",

          "content": "§ 1236.41   Definitions for this subpart.\nIn addition to the definitions contained in § 1220.18 of this subchapter and § 1236.2, the following definitions apply to this subpart:\n\nAccuracy is the degree to which the information correctly describes the object or process being measured. It can be thought of in terms of how close a reading or average of readings is to a true or target value. Accuracy is a different measure than precision.\n\nAdobe RGB is a red, green, blue color space developed to display on computer monitors most of the colors that CMYK color printers produce. The Adobe RGB color space is significantly larger than the sRGB color space, particularly in the cyan and green regions.\n\n\n\nAimpoint is a specific value assigned to a given metric to assess performance achievement.\n\nArtifact (defect) is a general term to describe a broad range of undesirable flaws or distortions in digital reproductions produced during image capture or data processing. Some common forms of image artifacts include noise, chromatic aberration, blooming, interpolation, and imperfections created by compression.\n\nBatch is a group of files that are created under the same conditions or are related intellectually or physically. During digitization, batches represent groups of records that are digitized and undergo QC inspection processes together.\n\nBit depth is the number of bits used to represent each pixel in an image. The term is sometimes used to represent bits per pixel and at other times, the total number of bits used multiplied by the number of total channels. For example, a typical color image using 8 bits per channel is often referred to as a 24-bit color image (8 bits x 3 channels). Color scanners and digital cameras typically produce 24-bit (8 bits x 3 channels) images or 36-bit (12 bits x 3 channels) capture, and high-end devices can produce 48-bit (16-bit x 3 channels) images. Bit depth is also referred to as “color depth.”\n\nClipping is the abrupt truncation of a signal when the signal exceeds a system's ability to differentiate signal values above or below a particular level. In the case of images, the result is that there is no differentiation of light tones when the clipping is at the high end of signal amplitude, and no differentiation of dark tones when clipping occurs at the low end of signal amplitude.\n\nCMYK is a subtractive color model used in printing that is based on cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). These are typically referred to as “process colors.” Cyan absorbs the red component of white light, magenta absorbs green, and yellow absorbs blue. In theory, the mix of the three colors will produce black, but black ink is also used to increase the density of black in a print.\n\nColor accuracy is measured by computing the color difference (ΔE2000) between the digital imaging results of the standard target patches and their premeasured color values. By imaging an appropriate target and evaluating through the software, variances from known values can be determined, which is a good indicator of how accurately the system is recording color. Analytical software measures the average deviation of all color patches measured (the mean).\n\nColor channel misregistration is the measurement of color-to-color spatial dislocation of otherwise spatially coincident color features of a digitized object.\n\nColor management is using software, hardware, and procedures to measure and control color in an imaging system, including capture and display devices.\n\nColor space is a specific organization of colors that supports reproducible representations of color in combination with color profiling supported by various devices. A color space can be a helpful conceptual tool for describing or understanding the color capabilities of a particular device or digital file. Examples of color spaces include Adobe RGB 1998, sRGB, ECIRGB_v2, and ProPhoto RGB.\n\nCompression, lossless is a technique for data compression that will allow the decompressed data to be exactly the same as the original data before compression, bit-for-bit. The compression of data is achieved by coding redundant data in a more efficient manner than in the uncompressed format.\n\nCompression, visually lossless is a form or manner of lossy compression where the data that is lost after the file is compressed and decompressed is not detectable to the human eye; the compressed data appearing identical to the uncompressed data.\n\nDigital Image Conformance Evaluation (DICE) is the measurement and monitoring component of the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) Conformance Program. The program consists of measuring ISO-compliant reference targets and using analysis software such as OpenDICE for testing and monitoring digitization programs to ensure they meet FADGI technical parameters. Agencies can access FADGI-compliant tools and resources online at http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-OpenDice.html.\n\nDigitization project is any action an agency (including an agent acting on the agency's behalf, such as a contractor) takes to digitize permanent records. For example, a digitization project can range from a one-time digitization effort to a multiyear digitization process; can involve digitizing a single document into a digital records management system or digitizing boxes of records from storage facilities; or can include digitizing active records as part of an ongoing business process or digitizing inactive records for better access.\n\nDigitized record is a digital record created by converting paper or other media formats to a digital form that is of sufficient authenticity, reliability, usability, and integrity to serve in place of the source record.\n\nDynamic range is the ratio between the smallest and largest possible values of a changeable quantity, frequently encountered in imaging or recorded sound. Dynamic range is another way of stating the maximum signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nFederal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) is a collaborative effort by Federal agencies to articulate Technical Guidelines that form the basis for many of the technical parameters in this part, which equate to the FADGI three-star level. Agencies can access FADGI online at http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-technical.html.\n\nGrayscale is an image type lacking any chromatic data, consisting of shades of gray ranging from white to black. Most commonly seen as having 8 bits per pixel, allowing for 256 shades or levels of intensity.\n\nImage quality is the degree of perceived or objective measurement of a digital image's overall accuracy in faithfully reproducing an original. A digital image created to a high degree of accuracy meets or exceeds objective performance attributes (such as level of detail, tonal and color fidelity, and correct exposure), and has minimal defects (such as noise, compression artifacts, or distortion).\n\nLightness uniformity measures how evenly a lens records the lighting of neutral reference targets from center to edge and between points within the image.\n\nModulation transfer function (MTF)/spatial frequency response (SFR) is the modulation ratio between the output image and the ideal image. SFR measures the imaging system's ability to maintain contrast between progressively smaller image details. Using these two functions, a system can make an accurate determination of resolution related to the sampling frequency.\n\nNewton's Rings are interference patterns that appear as a series of concentric, alternating light and dark rings of colored light (when imaged in a color mode). This type of interference is caused when smooth transparent surfaces come into contact with small gaps of air between the surfaces. The light waves reflect from the top and bottom surfaces of the air film formed between the surfaces, causing light rays to constructively or destructively interfere with each other. The areas where there is constructive interference will appear as light bands and the areas where there is destructive interference will appear as dark bands.\n\n\n\nNoise is one or more undesirable image artifact(s) in a digitized record that is not part of the source material.\n\nPixels per inch (ppi), describes the resolution capabilities of an imaging device, such as a scanner, or the resolution of a digital image. PPI is different from dots per inch (dpi).\n\nPosterization is an effect produced by reducing the number of tones (colors) in an image so that there is a noticeable distinction between one tone and another instead of a gradual shift between them.\n\nPrecision is the characteristic of measurement that relates to the consistency between multiple measurements, under uniform conditions, of the same item or process. As opposed to accuracy, precision does not indicate how close a measurement is to a true value.\n\nQuantization is a lossy compression technique that involves compressing a range of values to a single quantum value, usually to reduce file size. This may result in flaws in an image, such as posterization, caused by reducing the data available in an image file to represent aspects like colors.\n\nRaster image is a digitally encoded representation of a subject's tonal and brightness information into a bitmap. Data from digital cameras and scanning devices record light characteristics as numerical values into a grid, or raster, of picture elements (pixels).\n\nReference target is a chart of test patterns and patches with known standard values used to evaluate the performance of an imaging system.\n\nReflective digitization is a process in which an imaging system captures reflected light off of scanned objects such as bound volumes, loose pages, cartographic materials, illustrations, posters, photographic prints, or newsprint.\n\nReproduction scale accuracy measures the relationship between the physical size of the original object and the size in pixels per inch (PPI) of that object in the digital image.\n\nResolution is the level of spatial detail rendered by an imaging system as measured by MTF/SFR.\n\nSampling frequency measures the imaging spatial resolution and is computed as the physical pixel count or pixels per unit of measurement, such as pixels per inch (PPI). This parameter provides information about the size of the original and the data needed to determine the level of detail recorded in the file. (See also modulation transfer function (MTF)/spatial frequency response (SFR).)\n\nSharpening artificially enhances details to create the illusion of greater definition. Image quality testing using the SFR quantifies the level of sharpening introduced by imaging systems or applied by users in post-processing actions.\n\nSource record is the record from which a digitized version or digitized record is created. The source record should be the record copy that was used in the course of agency business.\n\nSpatial resolution determines the amount (for example, quantity, PPI, megapixels) of data in a raster image file in terms of the number of picture elements or pixels per unit of measurement, but it does not define or guarantee the quality of the information. Spatial resolution defines how finely or widely spaced the individual pixels are from each other. The actual rendition of fine detail is more dependent on the SFR of the scanner or digital camera.\n\nsRGB is a standard RGB color space created by HP and Microsoft for use on monitors, printers, and the internet. sRGB uses the ITU-R BT.709-5 primaries that are also used in studio monitors and HDTV, and a transfer function (gamma correction) typical of CRTs (cathode ray tube TVs and computer monitors), all of which permits sRGB to be directly displayed on typical monitors. The sRGB gamma is not represented by a single numerical value. The overall gamma is approximately 2.2, consisting of a linear (gamma 1.0) section near black, and a non-linear section elsewhere involving a 2.4 exponent and a gamma changing from 1.0 through about 2.3.\n\nTolerance is the allowable deviation from a specified value.\n\nTone response or optoelectronic conversion function (OECF) is a measure of how accurately the digital imaging system converts light levels into digital pixels.\n\nTransmissive digitization is a process in which the system transmits light through a photographic slide or negative.\n\nWhite balance error is a measurement of the digital file's color neutrality. The definition of “neutral” is not universal: RGB workflows that use digital count values encode neutral as defined by the International Color Consortium (ICC) color space chosen. L*a*b* workflows define neutral as 0 on the a* axis and b* axis, with the lightness recorded from 0-100 on the L* axis.",

          "content": "§ 1236.42   Records management requirements.\n(a) Before starting a digitization project, agencies must establish intellectual control of the records that will be digitized. Intellectual control means having the information necessary to identify and understand the content and context of the records. One traditional records management technique to establish intellectual control is the creation of an inventory. The inventory must identify whether the records are complete, if there are any gaps in coverage or missing records, the presence of any mixed-media records, the disposition schedule under which the records fall, the date range when the records were created, any access or use restrictions that apply to the records, and the records' storage location.\n\n(b) Agencies must identify any relationships between the source records in order to retain these relationships between the digitized versions. For example, are there case files that are associated by case number? Does a folder contain multiple documents that are stapled together? Are there digital components of a mixed-media file stored on removable media (DVD or USB drives)? What is the relationship of the folder to other folders in a box? Any relationships must be captured as part of the digitization process:\n\n(1) Through metadata (See § 1236.54 for metadata requirements);\n\n(2) By organizing the folder structure of a file system;\n\n(3) By using file formats that allow for multi-page files, such as PDF or TIFF; or\n\n(4) Through a combination of these approaches.\n\n(c) In addition, the inventory can be used to identify all the elements of physical control needed for the records to be digitized. Physical control includes understanding the physical characteristics of source records. Physical characteristics determine a project's scope, and the image capture techniques and equipment to be used. For example, the type of paper, the type of printing, or the size of the records can impact what methods and equipment are used to digitize records.\n\n(d) There are additional considerations for managing the source records during the digitization process:\n\n(1) Ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the source records to prevent their loss or damage.\n\n(2) Restrict access to source records while they are being digitized to minimize the risk of unauthorized additions, deletions, or alterations.\n\n(3) Ensure there is a process to identify and document gaps in coverage or missing records.\n\n(e) Agencies must ensure that records are free from unauthorized alteration, destruction, or deletion by complying with the mechanisms and controls specified in §§ 1236.10 and 1236.20:\n\n(1) The agency may generate checksums using the SHA-256 hash algorithm and record them as technical metadata in a recordkeeping system for each image file when digitization is complete and the agency determines that the records are no longer in active use and the metadata are no longer subject to any changes that may result from ongoing business use. Use the checksums to monitor the digitized records for corruption or alteration and capture them as metadata as required in § 1236.54; or\n\n(2) The agency may perform file integrity monitoring or file comparison audits.\n\n(f) If there are born-digital records that are part of the record series within the project, follow the instructions for managing mixed-media records in § 1236.52.",

The agency must meet the image quality performance parameters specified in § 1236.50 by verifying how well the equipment meets the aim points and tolerances of the parameters. The agency cannot rely solely on equipment specifications, such as scanner ppi settings or camera sensor megapixels, to ensure digital image quality.\n\n(1) The agency must use QA processes to:\n\n(i) Quantify scanner or camera performance before selecting the equipment by scanning a reference target and measuring the results with analytical software to determine if the equipment meets the technical parameters.\n\n(ii) Evaluate internal or external vendor imaging systems against image quality performance parameters;\n\n(iii) Monitor equipment performance by quantifying scanner or camera performance during digitization; and\n\n(iv) Verify that resulting digital files meet project specifications.\n\n(b) Quality Control (QC) requirements. The agency must implement QC inspection and monitoring processes to ensure that images meet the digitization image quality parameters in § 1236.50.\n\n(1) The Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) Digital Image Conformance Evaluation program (DICE) is a QC inspection and monitoring process that uses image targets and analysis software to verify compliance. Applied properly, this methodology will ensure agencies meet the requirements in § 1236.50.\n\n(2) If the agency does not adopt the FADGI Conformance Evaluation program, it must document both the procedures used and how it verified conformance to the quality parameters.\n\n(c) Quality Control (QC) testing and analysis. During the digitization process, the agency must perform QC testing and analysis to identify malfunctioning or improperly configured digitization equipment, improper software application settings, incorrect metadata capture, or human error, and take corrective actions. It must:\n\n(1) Implement an image quality analysis process and use reference targets to verify that digitization devices conform to imaging parameters in this subpart;\n\n(2) Replace reference targets as they fade or accumulate dirt, scratches, and other surface marks that reduce their usability;\n\n(3) Regularly test equipment to ensure scanners and digital cameras/copy systems are performing optimally. It must:\n\n(i) Scan a reference target containing a grayscale, color chart, and accurate dimensional scale at the beginning of each workday;\n\n(ii) Use image quality analysis software to verify that the performance evaluation specifications are being met; and\n\n(iii) Perform additional tests when problems are detected.\n\n(4) Test equipment with the specific software/device driver combination(s), and re-test after any changes to the workflow; and\n\n(5) Ensure that equipment operation, settings, and image processing actions are the same as those used to evaluate the test target. Turn off auto correction settings in the capture equipment such as “auto exposure” that may cause non-conformance of the target evaluation or the resulting image files.\n\n(d) Quality control inspection. (1) The agency must perform QC inspections of the digital records for compliance with the technical parameters and criteria specified in this subpart. The inspection must ensure 100% of the image files:\n\n(i) Can open and be displayed;\n\n(ii) Are encoded with a compression type and in a format specified in § 1236.48; and\n\n(iii) Have the resolution, color mode, bit depth, and color profile specified in § 1236.50.\n\n(2) The agency must perform a visual inspection using a statistically valid technique:\n\n(i) The agency may visually inspect a random sample of a minimum of ten digital records or 10% of each batch of digital records, whichever is larger; or\n\n(ii) The agency may employ a statistically valid sampling plan to verify that the image quality, file quality, metadata quality, and completeness requirements have been met. Agencies that employ their own sampling technique must include documentation of the method used, as specified in § 1236.44(d)(3)(i).\n\n(3) Visual inspection must be conducted using a calibrated graphics workstation and using a monitor set to 100% magnification to check the following image quality characteristics:\n\n(i) Image tone, brightness, contrast, and color accuracy match the specifications in § 1236.50;\n\n(ii) Images are free from clipping (missing detail lost in highlights or shadows);\n\n(iii) Images are free from color channel misregistration, or quantization errors;\n\n(iv) Images are free of any image artifacts that compromise the informational content of the record, such as dust, Newton's rings, missing pixels, scan lines, drop-outs, flare, or over-sharpening; and\n\n(v) Images are not improperly cropped, have the expected dimensions and orientation (landscape/horizontal or portrait/vertical), and images are not flipped, inverted, or skewed.\n\n(e) Corrective measures. If the inspection reveals errors, perform the following steps until there is a 100% success rate for the sample set:\n\n(1) If 1% or more of examined records fail to meet any of the criteria in § 1236.50, determine the source and scope of any errors, correct or re-digitize affected records, and reinspect the images by following the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section;\n\n(2) If less than 1% of examined records fail to meet any of the criteria in § 1236.50, determine the source and scope of any errors and correct or re-digitize the affected records.\n\n(f) Inspection for other quality aspects. The agency must inspect the resulting files to verify that they meet the metadata and records completeness requirements:\n\n(1) Metadata quality. The agency must evaluate the accuracy of metadata. This may be done using automated techniques if appropriate. Otherwise, the QC inspections must be done manually. These inspections must ensure that:\n\n(i) Files are named according to project specifications; and\n\n(ii) Correct administrative, descriptive, and technical metadata are captured in a recordkeeping system and in image files.\n\n(2) Records completeness. The agency must employ automated and visual inspection processes to verify the completeness and accuracy of digitization:\n\n(i) Verify that all records have been accounted for by referring to box lists, folder title lists, or other inventories;\n\n(ii) Compare source records with their digitized versions to verify that 100% of the informational content has been captured;\n\n(iii) Compare source records with their digitized versions to verify the digitized records are in the same order;\n\n(iv) Examine records for related envelopes, notes, or other forms of media to verify that all sources of record information have been digitized;\n\n(v) Verify that any mixed-media records that cannot be digitized are associated with the digitized records using the “Relation” metadata elements in § 1236.54(c); and\n\n(vi) Confirm that missing pages or images have been noted in the project documentation.",

This section describes the minimum requirements appropriate for digitizing paper records. Depending on the physical characteristics of the source records, the agency must select the applicable specifications described in either table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section for modern textual paper records or the table 2 to paragraph (e) of this section for photographic prints and paper records with fine details. Agencies must implement appropriate equipment, lighting, special handling, or imaging methods to ensure the capture of all information. Agencies may exceed these requirements, if necessary, to capture fine detail or to meet their own business needs.\n\n(b) Image quality parameters. The performance parameters are based on FADGI three-star aim points and tolerance ranges.\n\n(c) Equipment requirements. The equipment used to digitize Federal records must be appropriate for the media type, and capable of achieving documented project objectives without damaging the source records.\n\n(d) Requirements for digitizing modern textual paper records. For these records, produce image files at a minimum of 300 ppi sized to the source document.\n\n(1) Records suitable for the specifications in table 1 to this paragraph (d) for modern textual paper records are modern textual documents with a well-defined printed type (such as typeset, typed, laser-printed), and with moderate to high contrast between the ink of the text and the paper background. Performance metric values in table 1 for modern textual paper records conform to the FADGI “Documents (Unbound): Modern Textual Records” category, and are appropriate when source records do not have visible content with L* values darker than 20. Neutral reference patches on the evaluation test target with L* less than 20 are not used for analysis.\n\n(2) For other paper records such as manuscripts, illustrations, graphics, and documents with poor legibility or diffuse characters (such as carbon copies or Thermofax) that have visible content with L* values darker than 20, agencies must evaluate neutral reference patches on the evaluation test target with L* greater than 20. (These values equate to FADGI three-star for “Documents (Unbound): General Collections”).\n\n(3) The agency must digitize in an acceptable RGB color mode if records contain color or other characteristics that are necessary to interpret the information of the source record, or that would be lost when digitizing using grayscale gamma 2.2.\n\n(4) At a minimum, the agency must digitize the paper records covered by this paragraph to the following parameters:\n\n\n\nTable 1 to Paragraph (d)—Requirements for Digitizing Permanent, Modern Textual Paper Records Table\n \n \nDigital file specificationsAttributes\nColor modecolor or grayscale.\nBit depth8 or 16.\nColor spacegray gamma 2.2, AdobeRGB1998, sRGB, ProPhoto RGB, ECIRGBv2.\nResolution (Sampling Frequency) (Units are Pixels Per Inch/ppi minus Reproduction Scale Accuracy)≥294 ppi (300 ppi—2%).\nMeasurement parametersPerformance metric values\n\n\nDifference from aim (applies to 20 ≤ L* ≤ 100).\nTone Response (OECF) L* (Units Colorimetric ΔL*) gray patches that meet the measurement parameters± 5.\nWhite Balance (Units Colorimetric ΔE(a*b*)) gray patches that meet the measurement parameters≤4%.\nLightness Uniformity (Units Colorimetric—Standard Deviation Divided by Mean L*)≤3%.\nAverage Color Accuracy (Units Colorimetric—Mean ΔE 2000—for patches meeting the measurement parameters)≤ 3.5.\nColor Accuracy 90th Percentile (Units Colorimetric—2.5 times average deviation for patches meeting the measurement parameters)≤ 8.75.\nColor Channel Misregistration (Units Pixels)< 0.5 pixel.\nSFR 10 (Sampling Efficiency) (Measurement is a Ratio %)>80%.\nMTF50 (50% SFR) (Percentage of Half Sampling Frequency) [Lower, Upper]Percentage of half sampling frequency: [>40%, <75%].\nReproduction Scale Accuracy (Units % Difference from Header PPI)<±2%.\nSharpening (Units Max Modulation)< 1.1.\nNoise (Upper Limit) (Units Std Dev of L*)≤ 2.\nNoise (Warning Limit) (Units Std Dev of L*)≥.25.\n(e) Requirements for digitizing photographic prints and paper records that have fine details. Records that have fine detail, require a high degree of color accuracy, or have other unique characteristics, must be captured using the specifications in table 2 to this paragraph (e) for photographic prints and paper records with fine details. For these records, produce image files (as described table 2) at a minimum of 400 ppi sized to the source document (these performance values equate to FADGI three-star category “Prints and Photographs”). It may be necessary to apply a higher resolution than the minimum for some records that have fine detail.\n\n(1) These specifications apply to records such as photographic prints, graphic-arts prints (for example, lithographs or intaglio), drawings, embossed seals, and records that have information that cannot be captured by the parameters in table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section for modern textual paper records.\n\n(i) For records in which the smallest significant detail is 1.0 mm or smaller, such as aerial photographs and topographic maps (which require a high degree of enlargement and precision to ensure the dimensional accuracy of the scans), the agency must increase the resolution to capture all the information in the source record.\n\n(ii) For many imaging devices, increasing the ppi settings may not increase the actual resolution level or capture the desired detail. The equipment for digitizing records with fine detail must be capable of meeting the higher quality parameters. It may be necessary to exceed the parameters in table 2 to this paragraph (e) to capture all the information inherent in the records.\n\n(2) The agency must digitize photographic prints, including monochrome and black and white, using a color mode.\n\n(3) The agency must digitize in an acceptable color mode if records contain color or other characteristics that are necessary to interpret the information of the source record, or that would be lost when digitizing using grayscale gamma 2.2.\n\n(4) At a minimum, agencies must digitize all records covered by this paragraph to the following parameters:\n\nTable 2 to Paragraph (e)—Requirements for Digitizing Permanent, Photographic Print Records and Paper Records That Have Fine Details\n \n \nDigital file specificationsAttributes\nColor modecolor or grayscale.\nBit depth8 or 16.\nColor spaceGray gamma 2.2, AdobeRGB1998, ProPhoto RGB, ECIRGBv2.\nResolution (Sampling Frequency) (Units are Pixels Per Inch/ppi minus Reproduction Scale Accuracy)≥392 ppi (400 ppi—2%).\nMeasurement parametersPerformance metric values\nTone Response (OECF) L* (Units Colorimetric ΔL2000*) for any given gray patch± 4.\nWhite Balance (Units Colorimetric ΔE(a*b*)) for any given gray patch≤4.\nLightness Uniformity (Units Colorimetric − Standard Deviation Divided by Mean)<3%.\nAverage Color Accuracy(Units Colorimetric—Mean ΔE 2000—average deviation of all patches)<3.5.\nColor Accuracy 90th Percentile (Units Colorimetric—2.5 times average deviation of all patches)<8.75.\nColor Channel Misregistration (Units Pixels)<0.5 pixel.\nSFR10 (Sampling Efficiency) (Measurement is a Ratio %)80%.\nSFR50 (50% SFR) (Units Percentage of Half Sampling Frequency) [Lower, Upper]Percentage of half sampling frequency: [>40%, <75%].\nReproduction Scale Accuracy (Units % Difference from Header PPI)<± 2%.\nSharpening (Units Max Modulation)<1.1.\nNoise (Upper Limit) (Units Std Dev of L*)<2.\nNoise (Lower Limit) (Units Std Dev of L*)—A warning should be raised if the image doesn't meet this criteria≥.25.",

Ensure that the metadata remains accurate and consistent regardless of where it is stored.\n\n(1) If using metadata to capture relationships between source records as required in § 1236.42(b), agencies must use the “Relation” metadata elements in table 1 to paragraph (c)(1) of this section for basic administrative metadata.\n\n(2) If using different metadata labels from the ones required in this section, agencies must document the labels that the agency uses and note this in the Details section of the ERA (Electronic Records Archive) Transfer Request (TR).\n\n(3) Determine the appropriate level to be used as the source of descriptive metadata. Depending on the agency's existing recordkeeping practices and level of intellectual control, use information from the project, record series, file unit, or item level as the source for administrative, technical, and descriptive metadata fields. If the components of a record have not been individually indexed with unique descriptions, apply the series or file unit-level descriptions to all of the image files within that grouping. If the components of the record do not have individual titles, the agency must apply the item Record IDs instead.\n\n(4) Include additional metadata if it is captured. If other metadata elements are provided in addition to the metadata requirements in this subpart, NARA will accept that metadata as part of the transfer process.\n\n(b) Metadata capture requirements.

The formats described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used for microfilming source documents on 16mm and 35mm roll film. A reduction ratio no greater than 1:24 is recommended for correspondence or similar typewritten documents. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting image quality requirements. When microfilming on 35mm film for aperture card applications, the format dimensions in ANSI/AIIM MS32 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Table 1 must be used, and the aperture card format “D Aperture” shown in ANSI/AIIM MS41 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Figure 1, must be used. The components of the aperture card, including the paper and adhesive, must conform to the requirements of ANSI/PIMA IT9.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The 35mm film used in the aperture card application must conform to film designated as LE 500 in ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).\n\n(2) COM. Microfilm created using computer output microfilm (COM) technology must use the simplex mode described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) at an effective ratio of 1:24 or 1:48 depending upon the application.\n\n(b) Microfiche. When creating microfiche, either by microfilming source documents or using COM technology, the formats and reduction ratios prescribed in ANSI/AIIM MS5 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used as specified for the size and quality of the documents being filmed. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for determining the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting the image quality requirements.\n\n(c) Index placement—(1) Source documents. When microfilming source documents, place indexes, registers, or other finding aids, if microfilmed, either in the first frames of the first roll of film or in the last frames of the last roll of film of a series. For microfiche, place the indexes in the last frames of the last microfiche or microfilm jacket of a series.\n\n(2) COM. Place indexes on COM following the data on a roll of film, in the last frames of a single microfiche, or in the last frames of the last fiche in a series.

Agencies must determine minimum resolution on microforms of source documents using the method in the Quality Index Method for determining resolution and anticipated losses when duplicating, as described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 and ANSI/AIIM MS43 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). Agencies must perform resolution tests using an ANSI/ISO 3334 Resolution Test Chart (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) or a commercially available certifiable target manufactured to comply with this standard, and read the patterns following the instructions of ANSI/ISO 3334. Agencies must use the smallest character used to display information to determine the height used in the Quality Index formula. Agencies must use a Quality Index of five at the third generation level.\n\n(ii) COM. COM must meet the requirements of ANSI/AIIM MS1 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).\n\n(2) Background density of images. Agencies must use the background ISO standard visual diffuse transmission density on microforms appropriate to the type of documents being filmed. Agencies must use the procedure for density measurement described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The densitometer must meet with ANSI/NAPM IT2.18 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for spectral conditions and ANSI/NAPM IT2.19 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for geometric conditions for transmission density.\n\n(i) Recommended visual diffuse transmission background densities for images of documents are as follows:\n\nClassification\nDescription of document\nBackground density\nGroup 1High-quality, high contrast printed book, periodicals, and black typing1.3-1.5\nGroup 2Fine-line originals, black opaque pencil writing, and documents with small high contrast printing1.15-1.4\nGroup 3Pencil and ink drawings, faded printing, and very small printing, such as footnotes at the bottom of a printed page1.0-1.2\nGroup 4Low-contrast manuscripts and drawing, graph paper with pale, fine-colored lines; letters typed with a worn ribbon; and poorly printed, faint documents0.8-1.0\nGroup 5Poor-contrast documents (special exception).0.7-0.85\n(ii) Recommended visual diffuse transmission densities for computer generated images are as follows:\n\nFilm type\nProcess\nDensity measurement method\nMin.

The base plus fog density of unexposed, processed microfilms must not exceed 0.10. When a tinted base film is used, the density will be increased. The difference must be added to the values given in the tables in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n\n(4) Line or stroke width. Due to optical limitations in most micrographic systems, microfilm images of thin lines appearing in the source documents will tend to fill in as a function of their width and density. Therefore, as the reduction ratio of a given system is increased, reduce the background density as needed to ensure that the copies will be legible.",

The categories are: Commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions; news media requesters; and all other requesters.\n\n(g) Fee waiver means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester is able to demonstrate that certain standards set forth in the FOIA are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.\n\n(h) FOIA Public Liaison means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.\n\n(i) FOIA request means a written request, that cites the Freedom of Information Act, for access to NARA operational records, records of the executive branch of the Federal Government held by NARA, or Presidential or Vice Presidential records in NARA's custody that were created after January 19, 1981.\n\n(j) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) means the law codified at 5 U.S.C. 552 that provides the public with the right to request Government records from Federal executive branch agencies.\n\n(k) Non-commercial scientific institution request means a request submitted by an institution that is not operated on a basis that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of any person or organization, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research.\n\n(l) Operational records means records that NARA creates or receives in carrying out our mission and responsibilities as an executive branch agency. This does not include archival records as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(m) Original Classification Authority means the authority to classify information as National Security Information at creation, as granted by the President of the United States in Executive Order 13526, section 1.3, and defined in 32 CFR part 2001.\n\n(n) Other request means a request submitted by any individual whose request does not qualify as a commercial-use request, representative of the news media request (including a request made by a freelance journalist), or an educational or non-commercial scientific institution request.\n\n(o) Presidential records means the official Presidential and Vice Presidential records created or received by the President, the Vice President, or the White House staff since January 20, 1981, and covered under the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207. Presidential Executive orders also apply to these records.\n\n(p) Presidential Records Act (PRA) means the law that, in part, governs access to Presidential and Vice Presidential records and is codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 and Part 1270 of these regulations. The PRA contains six restrictions that authorize NARA to withhold information, which apply for 12 years after a President leaves office. Four of the PRA restrictions are identical to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Two relate to appointments to Federal office and confidential communications requesting or submitting advice between the President and his advisers, or between and among such advisers. The PRA also excludes application of FOIA Exemption 5.\n\n(q) Representative of the news media means a person or entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public, and that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals, including print and online publications that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. We consider requests for records that support the news-dissemination function of the requester to be a non-commercial use. We consider “freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity as working for that entity. A publishing contract provides the clearest evidence that a journalist expects publication; however, we also consider a requester's past publication record. We decide whether to grant a requester media status on a case-by-case basis, based on the requester's intended use.\n\n(r) Review means examining documents responsive to a request to determine whether any portions of them are exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure), including redacting the record and marking the appropriate FOIA exemptions.\n\n(s) Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.\n\n(t) Submitter means any person or entity providing potentially confidential commercial information to an agency, which information may be subject to a FOIA request. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, individuals, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.",

          "content": "§ 1250.8   Does NARA provide access under FOIA to all the executive branch records housed at NARA facilities?\n(a) NARA provides access under FOIA to the records NARA creates (operational records) and records originating in the executive branch that have been transferred to the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States (archival records). The NARA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent unit within NARA that controls access under FOIA to the operational records that OIG creates. NARA OIG handles FOIA requests it receives separately and independently from FOIA requests to NARA.\n\n(b) NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), located in St. Louis, Missouri, is the repository for twentieth- and twenty-first-century personnel and medical records of former members of the military and personnel records of former civilian employees of the Federal Government.\n\n(1) Those official personnel and medical files that have been transferred to NARA's legal custody are processed by NARA according to this part, at §§ 1250.20 through 1250.32.\n\n(2) Those personnel and medical records that remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them are governed by the FOIA and other access regulations of the originating agencies, which the NPRC processes under authority delegated by the originating agencies, not under the provisions of this part. Because of the intricacies of other agencies' FOIA regulations, further explanation here is not feasible. More information about the NPRC processes, including access to NPRC records, is available on NARA's Web site at http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/ and at http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/civilian-personnel.\n\n(c) NARA's Federal records centers store records that agencies no longer need for day-to-day business. These records remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them. Requests for access to another agency's records in a NARA Federal records center should be made directly to the originating agency. We do not process FOIA requests for these records.\n\n(d) If your FOIA request includes a record in the legal custody of an originating agency, we forward that request to the originating agency for processing. We also provide you with notification that we have done so and with contact information for the originating agency. (See 36 CFR 1256.2 for more information about how to access records that are stored in Federal records centers.)\n\n[79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]",

The more information you provide, the better possibility NARA has of finding the records you are seeking. Information that will help NARA find the records includes:\n\n(1) The agencies, offices, or individuals involved;\n\n(2) The approximate date(s) when the records were created;\n\n(3) The subject, title, or description of the records sought; and\n\n(4) Author, recipient, case number, file designation, or reference number.\n\n(b) Include your name and full mailing address as well as phone number and email address. This information allows us to reach you faster if we have any questions about your request. It is your responsibility to keep your current mailing address up to date with the office where you have filed the FOIA request.\n\n(c) If you request records about yourself, you must do so in accordance with the Privacy Act and our implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 1202. This includes requirements to verify your identity (see 36 CFR 1202.40). If you request records about someone other than yourself, you may receive greater access if you submit either a notarized document signed by the other person that certifies their identity and gives their permission for you to have access, or proof that the other person is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). NARA may, at its discretion, require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure of records about them.\n\n(d) Mark both your letter and envelope, or the subject line of your email, with the words “FOIA Request.”\n\n(e) Before filing your request, you may find it helpful to consult NARA's “Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide”—which is available electronically at http://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html, and in paper form.

          "content": "§ 1250.26   How does NARA process my FOIA request?\n(a) Acknowledgement. NARA acknowledges all FOIA requests in writing within 20 working days after receipt by the appropriate office (see 36 CFR 1250.22). The acknowledgement letter or email informs you of your request tracking number, and any complexity in processing that may lengthen the time NARA requires to reach a final decision on the release of the records. The acknowledgement letter or email may also seek additional information to clarify your request or to ask you to narrow the scope of a very large or broad request.\n\n(b) Clarification of requests. Requests must reasonably describe the records sought. If we determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, or if we are uncertain about another aspect of the request, we contact you to ask for clarification.\n\n(c) Search cut-off date. As the end or cut-off date for a records search, NARA uses the date on which we first begin our search for documents responsive to your request, unless you specify an earlier cut-off date. This includes those cases when you request records “through the present,” “through today,” or similar language. If NARA uses any other search end date, we inform you of that date.\n\n(d) Stops in processing time, clarification requests, and administrative closure. NARA may stop the clock for processing a request one time in order to seek your clarification. In such a case, the processing time resumes upon our receipt of your response. We provide at least 60 calendar days for you to respond to a request for clarification. If you do not clarify the request within 60 calendar days, we deny the request for not reasonably describing the records sought and provide you with the opportunity to appeal under the procedures in Subpart D. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, NARA reserves the right to administratively close the FOIA request 60 calendar days after the date of the last correspondence we send.\n\n(e) Confidential commercial information. If you have requested records containing confidential commercial information, refer to 36 CFR 1250.82 for information on how we process that request.\n\n(f) Processing queues. NARA places FOIA requests in simple or complex processing queues to be processed in the order received, on a first-in, first-out basis. In most cases, we make a determination about release of the records you requested within 20 working days from when the appropriate office receives your request (simple queue processing). However, if complexity or unusual circumstances prevent NARA from making a decision within 20 working days, we place your request into a complex processing queue. This way, such cases do not hold up the processing of other requests that do not include such time-consuming factors. We notify you of complicating factors in our acknowledgement letter or email, and you may choose to limit the scope of your request to convert the complex processing queue request to a simple processing queue request. For more detailed information on NARA's multi-track processing queues, see our FOIA Guide at http://www.archives.gov/foia-guide.html (for a paper copy, see 36 CFR 1250.20(d)).\n\n(g) Complex processing queue factors. We place into a complex processing queue any request that cannot be completed within 20 working days due to complexity, volume, because it contains national security information, because it involves Presidential or Vice Presidential records, or involves unusual circumstances. Unusual circumstances include the need to:\n\n(1) Search for and collect the records from one or more field facilities;\n\n(2) Search for, collect, and review a voluminous amount of records that are part of a single request;\n\n(3) Consult with another Federal agency before releasing records; or\n\n(4) Refer records to another Federal agency for declassification.\n\n(h) Complex processing schedule. If NARA needs to extend the deadline for more than an additional 10 working days due to the complexity of a request or as a result of unusual circumstances, we ask if you wish to modify your request so that we can answer the request sooner. If you do not wish to modify your request, we work with you to arrange an alternative schedule for review and release. We will also notify you that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is available to provide dispute resolution services, and how to contact them.\n\n(i) Complex processing: National security declassification and release. NARA does not have the authority to declassify and release records containing national security information without the approval of the agencies that have Original Classification Authority for the information contained in the records. We send copies of the documents to the appropriate originating Federal agencies for declassification review. We also send you an initial response to your FOIA request within 20 working days, informing you of this consultation with, or referral to, another Federal agency, except to the extent that the association with the other agency may itself be classified. Upon your request, we provide you an estimated date of completion.\n\n(j) Complex processing: Presidential or Vice Presidential records. If you request Presidential or Vice Presidential records and we determine that the records are not subject to any applicable FOIA or Presidential Records Act (PRA) exemption (and can therefore be released), we must notify the current and former President(s) or Vice President(s) of our intention to disclose information from those records. After receiving the notice, the current and former President(s) and Vice President(s) have a period of time (as set out in the applicable Executive order on implementation of the PRA) in which to choose whether to invoke Executive Privilege to deny access to the requested information. Although we send you an initial status response to your FOIA request within 20 working days in these cases, the final response to your FOIA request will take longer. We can provide the final response only at the end of the Presidential notification period set forth in the Executive order.\n\n[79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]",

If NARA must refer a request to another agency, we will inform you and suggest that you seek expedited review from that agency. NARA cannot expedite the review of classified records nor can we shorten the Presidential notification period described in 36 CFR 1250.26(j).\n\n(c) To request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining the basis for your need for expedited processing. You must send the request to the appropriate official at the address listed in § 1250.22 of this subpart. You may request expedited processing when you first request records or at any time during NARA's processing of your request or appeal.\n\n(d) We will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of our receipt of your request to expedite. If we grant your request, the NARA office responsible for the review of the requested records will process your request as a priority, and it will be processed as soon as practicable. We will inform you if we deny your request for expedited processing. If you decide to appeal that denial, we will expedite our review of your appeal.",

          "content": "§ 1250.30   How does NARA respond to my request?\n(a) NARA sends you a response informing you of our release determination, including whether any responsive records were located, how much responsive material was located, whether the records have been released in full or withheld in full or in part, where you may review the records, and any fees you must pay for the request. We will use plain language in all written communications with requesters.\n\n(b) If we deny any part of your request, our response will explain the reasons for the denial, which FOIA exemptions apply to withhold records, your right to appeal that determination, and your right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS.\n\n(c) NARA may withhold records in full or in part if any of the nine FOIA exemptions apply. NARA withholds information only where disclosure is prohibited by law (such as information that remains classified, or information that is specifically exempt by statute) or where we reasonably foresee that disclosure would cause harm to an interest protected by one of the FOIA exemptions. If we must withhold part of a record, we provide access to the rest of the information in the record. On the released portion of the record, we indicate the amount of information we redacted and the exemption(s) we applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest the exemption protects. NARA may also determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format you sought. Information that may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA is:\n\nSection of the FOIA:\nReason for exemption:\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)“(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)“related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)“specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than § 552(b) of this title), provided that the statute:\n(A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or\n(B) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)“trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that are privileged or confidential;”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)“inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)“personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)“records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:\n(A) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n(B) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n(C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n(D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;\n(E) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or\n(F) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;”\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)“contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;” or\n5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)“geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.”\n(d) If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, we provide you with interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.\n\n(e) NARA may not withhold Presidential records subject to FOIA under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) as defined in the table in paragraph (c) of this section. However, NARA may withhold Presidential records under the remaining FOIA exemptions. In addition, Presidential records may be withheld under the six PRA restrictions for a period of 12 years from when a President leaves office, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2204 and 36 CFR part 1270. Representatives of the current and former Presidents may also review Presidential records, and may assert constitutionally-based privileges that would prevent NARA from releasing some or all or the information requested.\n\n[79 FR 56504, Sept. 22, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 8902, Feb. 1, 2017]",

When the search is relatively straightforward and can be performed by a clerical or administrative employee, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and must be done by a NARA professional employee, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).\n\n(2) Computer searching. NARA bases the fees for computer searches on the actual cost to NARA of operating the computer and the salary of the operator. When the search is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can conduct it, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must perform it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).\n\n(b) Review fees. (1) NARA charges review fees for time we spend examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. NARA charges review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a record.\n\n(2) The review fee is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).\n\n(3) NARA does not charge review fees for time we spend resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However, NARA does charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter.\n\n(c) Reproduction fees—(1) Self-service photocopying. At NARA facilities with self-service photocopiers, you may make reproductions of released paper records for $0.25 per page.\n\n(2) Photocopying standard-sized pages. When we make the photocopies for operational records, the charge is $0.30 per page.\n\n(3) Reproductions of electronic records. NARA charges you for our direct costs for staff time for programming, computer operations, and printouts or electromagnetic media to reproduce the requested electronic information. When the work is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can perform it, the rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must do it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).\n\n(4) Copying other media.

There must be a clear connection between the identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government and the subject of your request;\n\n(2) How the release will reveal meaningful information that the public does not already know about Federal Government activities. Disclosing information that is already in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially-identical form, does not add anything new to the public's understanding of Government activities;\n\n(3) How disclosure to you will advance public understanding of the issue;\n\n(4) Your expertise or understanding of the requested records as well as your ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public. NARA ordinarily presumes that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration;\n\n(5) How you intend to disseminate the requested information to a broad spectrum of the public; and\n\n(6) How disclosure will lead to a significantly greater understanding of the Government by the public.\n\n(c) After reviewing your request and determining that there is a substantial public interest in release, we also determine if the request primarily furthers your commercial interests. If it does, you are not eligible for a fee waiver.\n\n(d) You should ask for waiver or reduction of fees when you first submit your request to NARA, and should address the criteria referenced above. You may also ask for a fee waiver at a later time while the underlying record request is still pending or during an administrative appeal.\n\n(e) We may also waive (either partially or in full) or reduce fees for operational records in additional circumstances as a matter of administrative discretion.",

If we then believe that we should release the records under FOIA, we make reasonable efforts to inform the submitter. The notice to the submitter describes the business information requested or includes copies of the requested records. NARA does not notify the submitter when we determine that:\n\n(1) We must withhold the information under FOIA's exemptions;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or made available to the public; or\n\n(3) We are required by a statute (other than the FOIA), or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600, to disclose the information.\n\n(b) If the records are 10 or more years old, we review the records in response to a FOIA request as we would any other records, and at our discretion, inform the submitter. NARA releases the records if we determine that neither Exemption 4 nor any other exemption applies.\n\n(c) When the request is for information from a single or small number of submitters, we send a notice via registered mail to the submitter's last known address. NARA's notice to the submitter includes a copy of the FOIA request and tells the submitter the time limits and procedures for objecting to the release of the requested material.\n\n(d) When the request involves information from a voluminous number of submitters, we may post or publish the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending letters.\n\n(e) We provide the submitter with 20 working days from the date of NARA's notice to object to the release and to explain a basis for the objection, including justification and support for the claim. The NARA FOIA Officer may extend this period as appropriate.\n\n(f) We review and consider all objections to release that we receive within the time limit. Any information provided by a submitter under this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA. NARA considers a submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice to have no objection to disclosure of the information. If we decide to release the records, we inform the submitter in writing, along with NARA's reasons for the decision to release. We include with the notice copies of the records as we intend to release them. We also inform the submitter that we intend to release the records within a reasonable time after the date of the notice unless a U.S. District Court forbids disclosure. NARA will not consider any information we receive after the date of a disclosure decision.\n\n(g) If the requester files a lawsuit under the FOIA for access to any withheld records, we promptly notify the submitter.\n\n(h) NARA notifies the requester in three circumstances:\n\n(1) When we notify the submitter of the opportunity to object to disclosure, or to extend the time for objecting;\n\n(2) When we notify the submitter of our intent to disclose the requested information; and\n\n(3) When a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.",

          "content": "§ 1254.1   What kinds of archival materials may I use for research?\n(a) The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves records of all three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) of the Federal Government in record groups that reflect how government agencies created and maintained them. Most of these records are of Executive Branch agencies. We also have individual documents and collections of donated historical materials that significantly supplement existing records in our custody or provide information not available elsewhere in our holdings. Descriptions of many of our records are available through our Web site, http://www.archives.gov.\n\n(b) We provide information about records and we make them available to the public for research unless they have access restrictions. Some records may be exempt from release by law. Donors may apply restrictions on access to historical materials that they donate to NARA. Access restrictions are further explained in part 1256 of this chapter. We explain procedures for obtaining information about records in § 1254.2.\n\n(c) In addition to traditional paper (textual) materials, our holdings also include special media materials such as microfilm, still pictures, motion pictures, sound and video recordings, cartographic and architectural records, and electronic records. The majority of these materials are housed at the National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. Many of these types of materials also are represented in the holdings of our Presidential libraries and our regional archives facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter.\n\n(d) The majority of our archival materials are 30 years old or older.\n\n(e) Records creating agencies hold the legal title and control access to records housed in NARA records centers. Our procedures to obtain access to these records are in § 1256.2.",

For anyone unable to visit, we may provide information contained in specific documents by offering copies of the documents for a fee (see § 1254.60).\n\n(b) Requests must be on designated forms when we require them. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves these forms as information collections and the forms bear the approved control number.\n\n(c) If requests that we receive in the normal course of reference service do not specifically cite the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended), we do not consider those requests made under the Act.

If you travel long distance to conduct research in original archival materials at a NARA facility, we may ask you how we can contact you locally. In special circumstances, the director of a facility or unit has the authority to grant exceptions to these requirements.\n\n(b) If you apply for access to large quantities of documents or to documents that are especially fragile or valuable, we may require you to furnish additional information about reasons why you require access. Some materials are too fragile or valuable for direct handling or viewing. Preservation concerns (see §§ 1254.20(b) and 1254.36(e)) and availability of resources (see § 1254.20(c)) may limit our ability to accommodate certain requests.\n\n(c) If you are younger than 14, you must follow the procedures in § 1254.24 to seek permission to conduct research.\n\n(d) We do not issue you a researcher identification card if the appropriate supervisor or director of the NARA facility determines that the documents that you wish to use are not in the legal custody of NARA and you do not present appropriate written authorization from the legal title holder to examine the documents.\n\n(e) The collection of information contained in this section has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0016.",

Records with pending or future end-of-series additions are appropriate for filming.\n\n(d) The records to be filmed should not have substantial numbers of documents withdrawn because of continuing national security classification, privacy, or other restrictions.\n\n(e) We approve only requests to microfilm a complete body of documents, such as an entire series or a major continuous segment of a very large series that is reasonably divisible. Microfilming a complete body of documents means that you must consecutively copy all documents within the file unit(s), from the first to the last page, not skipping any pages in between except for pages that are exact duplicates or blank pages that are not included in a pagination scheme.\n\n(f) We normally approve only requests that include assurances that the project will adhere to the specifications in part 1230 of this chapter concerning microfilm stock standards, index placement, and microfilm processing for permanent records.\n\n(g) We approve only requests that specify that NARA will receive a first generation silver halide duplicate negative containing no splices made from the original camera negative of the microform record created in accordance with part 1230 of this chapter.\n\n(1) We may use this duplicate negative microform to make duplicate preservation and reference copies. The copies may be made available for NARA and public use in NARA facilities and programs immediately upon receipt.\n\n(2) We may also make additional use of the microform, as indicated in § 1254.98, seven years after you complete filming at the NARA facility, or upon delivery of the publication if there is no commercial distributor, or when the commercial distributor is no longer available, whichever occurs first. We may choose to add our own editorial material to the microform copies.\n\n(3) You must deliver detailed roll lists with the microfilm. The lists must give the full range of file titles and a complete list of all file numbers on each roll of microfilm. We prefer that the list be provided in a fielded, electronic format to facilitate its use by staff and researchers. If the electronic format is a data file with defined or delimited fields, you should transfer with the file the records layout identifying the fields, any coded values for fields, and explanations of any delimiters.\n\n(4) Microfilm projects may donate to us additional indexes and finding aids. NARA and the microfilm project execute a deed of gift that specifies restrictions on NARA's use and dissemination of these products under mutually acceptable terms.",

We may grant exceptions to this provision at our discretion.\n\n(c) We normally do not approve requests to microfilm documents:\n\n(1) Having restrictions on access that preclude their reproduction;\n\n(2) Known to be protected by copyright;\n\n(3) Having high intrinsic value that only authorized NARA personnel may handle;\n\n(4) In vulnerable physical condition;\n\n(5) Having a high research demand and which we would have to deny to others for an extended period of time during the microfilming process. Where possible, we assist you in developing filming schedules that avoid the need to close documents for a lengthy period of time; and\n\n(6) In formats, such as oversize documents, bound volumes, and others, that would be subject to excessive stress and possible damage from special equipment you plan to use, as well as documents fastened with grommets, heavy duty staples, miscellaneous fasteners, or wafers and other adhesives that cannot be removed without tearing or breaking documents.\n\n(d) We normally do not approve requests from persons or organizations that failed to produce usable microfilm or to honor commitments they made in previous requests, or for whom we have had to rescind previous permission to microfilm documents because of their conduct.\n\n(e) We do not approve requests to microfilm records in NARA facilities in which there is insufficient space available for private microfilming. We do not permit private microfilming in our records storage (stack) areas.\n\n(1) Federal agencies microfilming records in support of the agency's mission may use the space set aside for private microfilming. Agency microfilming takes priority over private microfilming when there is insufficient space to accommodate both at the same time.\n\n(2) When a NARA facility does not have enough space to accommodate all requests, we may schedule separate projects by limiting the time allowed for each particular project or by requiring projects to alternate their use of the space.\n\n(3) We also do not approve requests where the only space available for filming is in the facility's research room, and such work would disturb researchers. We do not move records from a facility lacking space for private microfilming to another NARA facility for that purpose.\n\n(f) We do not approve requests to microfilm records when there is not enough staff to provide the necessary support services, including document preparation, training of private microfilmers, and monitoring the filming.\n\n(g) We do not approve the start of a project to microfilm records until you have agreed in writing to the amount and schedule of fees for any training, microfilm preparation, and monitoring we must conduct that is necessary to support your project. Our letter of tentative approval for the project includes an agreement detailing the records in the project and the detailed schedule of fees for NARA services for the project.

We base fees for microfilm preparation on direct salary costs (including benefits) and supply costs when we perform the work. When a NARA contractor performs the work, the fees are the cost to NARA. Microfilm preparation includes:\n\n(1) Removing document fasteners from documents when the fasteners can be removed without damage to the documents; and\n\n(2) Taking any document conservation actions that must be accomplished in order to film the documents, such as document flattening or mending.\n\n(b) We provide you detailed information on the fees for microfilm preparation in the letter of approval. You must pay fees in accordance with § 1258.14 of this chapter. When a body of documents requires extensive microfilm preparation, we may establish a different payment schedule at our discretion.",

You may only use planetary type camera equipment. You may not use automatic rotary cameras and other equipment with automatic feed devices. We may approve your use of book cradles or other specialized equipment designed for use with bound volumes, oversized documents, or other formats, as well as other camera types not specified here, on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(b) The power consumption of the equipment normally must not exceed 1.2 kilowatts. Power normally available is 115 volts, 60 hz. You must make requests for electricity exceeding that normally available at least 90 days in advance.\n\n(c) You may not use equipment having clamps or other devices to exert pressure upon or to attach the document to any surface in a way that might damage the document.\n\n(d) The equipment must not use a heat generating light source in close enough proximity to the documents to result in their physical distortion or degradation. All sources of ultraviolet light must be filtered.",

Only persons who have attended NARA training will be permitted to handle the documents or supervise microfilming operations. We charge you fees for training services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits) and any related supply costs. We specify these fees in the written agreement we require for project approval in § 1254.102(h).\n\n(c) You may microfilm documents from only one file unit at a time. After you complete microfilming, you must return documents you removed from files for microfilming to their original position in the file container, refasten any fasteners you removed to facilitate copying, and remove any tabs you placed on the documents to identify items to copy. We will provide fasteners for replacement as necessary.\n\n(d) You may not leave documents unattended on the copying equipment or elsewhere.\n\n(e) Under normal microfilming conditions, actual copying time per sheet must not exceed 30 seconds.\n\n(f) You must turn off any lights used with the camera when the camera is not in actual operation.\n\n(g) You may operate microfilm equipment only in the presence of the research room attendant or a designated NARA employee. If NARA places microfilm projects in a common research area with other researchers, the project will not be required to pay for monitoring that is ordinarily provided. If the microfilm project is performed in a research room set aside for copying and filming, we charge the project fees for these monitoring services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits). When more than one project share the same space, monitoring costs will be divided equally among the projects. We specify the monitoring service fees in the written agreement required for project approval in § 1254.102(h).\n\n(h) The equipment normally should be in use each working day that it is in a NARA facility. The director of the NARA facility (as defined in § 1252.2 of this chapter) decides when you must remove equipment because of lack of regular use. You must promptly remove equipment upon request of the facility director.\n\n(i) We assume no responsibility for loss or damage to microfilm equipment or supplies you leave unattended.\n\n(j) We inspect the microform output at scheduled intervals during the project to verify that the processed film meets the microfilm preparation and filming standards required by part 1230 of this chapter. To enable us to properly inspect the film, we must receive the film within 5 days after it has been processed. You must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative of the filmed records (see § 1254.100(g)) according to the schedule shown in paragraph (k). If the processed film does not meet the standards, we may require that you refilm the records.\n\n(k) When you film 10,000 or fewer images, you must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative upon completion of the project. When the project involves more than 10,000 images, you must provide a silver halide duplicate negative of the first completed roll or segment of the project reproducing this image count to NARA for evaluation. You also must provide subsequent completed segments of the project, in quantities approximating 100,000 or fewer images, to NARA within 30 days after filming unless we approve other arrangements.\n\n(l) If the microfilming process is causing visible damage to the documents, such as flaking, ripping, separation, fading, or other damage, filming must stop immediately and until the problems can be addressed.",

          "content": "§ 1256.28   Does NARA make any exceptions for access to records containing privacy-restricted information?\n(a) NARA policy. Access to archival records containing information access to which would invade the privacy of an individual is restricted by § 1256.56.\n\n(1) NARA may authorize access to such records for the purpose of research to qualified persons doing biomedical or social science research under the conditions outlined in this section as long as the records do not also contain information restricted by statute or national security-classified information.\n\n(2) If NARA is able to make a copy of such records with all personal identifiers masked or deleted, NARA will make such a “sanitized” copy of the record available to all researchers in accordance with § 1256.24.\n\n(3) NARA will not grant access to restricted census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census less than 72 years old containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108(b).\n\n(b) Request for access. Researchers who wish to have access to records restricted by § 1256.56 to conduct biomedical or social science research must submit a written request to the NARA FOIA/Privacy Act Officer (NGC), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. OMB control number 3095-0002 has been assigned to this collection of information requirement. Researchers are encouraged to consult informally with NARA before submitting the formal request. The request must include the following information:\n\n(1) Name and mailing address;\n\n(2) Institutional affiliation and position, if applicable;\n\n(3) List of published research, if applicable;\n\n(4) References from two persons who have first-hand knowledge of the requester's qualifications to perform the research;\n\n(5) A statement of the nature of the research to be conducted and any plans for publication or presentation of the research findings;\n\n(6) A listing of all sources of grant funds supporting the research project or its publication;\n\n(7) A statement of the methodology to be used;\n\n(8) A statement of the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to be employed by the researcher to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records;\n\n(9) A listing of the record groups and series titles to be used; and\n\n(10) A statement that the researcher will abide by the conditions of access to be prescribed by NARA and that the researcher will assume responsibility for the action of all persons working with the researcher on the project.\n\n(c) Access Review Committee. Requests made under paragraph (b) of this section will be reviewed by NARA's Access Review Committee, which is composed of the Deputy Archivist of the United States, the Assistant Archivist for the Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, the Assistant Archivist for the Official of Regional Records Services, and the director(s) of the NARA division(s) that has custody of the requested records. The Committee may consult other persons within and outside the Federal Government who are knowledgeable in the research field for assistance in evaluating a request.\n\n(1) The Committee will examine the request to determine whether:\n\n(i) The requested information is of such a highly sensitive personal nature that disclosure must not be permitted even for biomedical or social science research;\n\n(ii) The methodology proposed by the requester will permit the researcher to obtain the projected research results without revealing personally identifying information;\n\n(iii) The research results are intended to be published or presented at an academic or research conference;\n\n(iv) The requester is a biomedical or social science researcher who has previous research experience and has submitted or intends to submit articles or books on such research for publication;\n\n(v) The safeguards proposed by the requester will adequately protect the personal information; and\n\n(vi) NARA has sufficient staff and space available to safeguard privacy interests necessary to accommodate the research project.\n\n(2) The decision of the Committee will be made in writing to the requester within 15 workdays after receipt of a completed request. At the discretion of the Committee, the researcher may meet with the Committee to discuss the project or to discuss revising the research proposal to meet possible objections of the Committee.\n\n(d) Conditions of access. Researchers who are granted access to restricted records, all others associated with the research project who will have access to personally identifiable information from the records, and the manager of any facility handling the records containing personal identifiers must agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to adhere to the conditions of access imposed by NARA. NARA will impose the following conditions of access on any project; additional conditions may be imposed on the use of specific records or on specific projects:\n\n(1) The records may be used only for the purpose of the research and for the reporting of research findings as described in the approved research project. The records may not be used for any other purpose;\n\n(2) The records and any authorized copies of records may not be transferred to any person or institution not directly involved with the approved research project and subject to a written agreement to maintain confidentiality specified in § 1256.28(d);\n\n(3) Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, as approved by NARA, to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records must be established by the researcher and followed by all persons associated with the project;\n\n(4) When required by NARA, the records must be consulted at the NARA facility where the records are located;\n\n(5) The researcher's notes must not contain any individually identifiable information. The researcher must use an alternate code system to render personally identifiable information as anonymous in all research notes;\n\n(6) Persons who are identified in the records may not be contacted by or on behalf of the researcher;\n\n(7) Before publication or public presentation of the data, the final research product(s) must be provided to the Deputy Archivist of the United States for review. NARA's review is limited to ensuring that there is no possible identification of individuals in the research findings. NARA will not evaluate the validity of the research findings.\n\n(e) Noncompliance with conditions of access. If we discover that a researcher has violated any of the conditions of access, we will take steps to revoke the NARA research privileges of that person and will consult with NARA's General Counsel or his or her designee to determine any other steps to be taken to prevent any further disclosure of the personal information concerned. NARA may also inform the following persons and organizations of the researcher's failure to follow the conditions of use:\n\n(1) The institution with which the researcher is affiliated, if applicable;\n\n(2) Persons who served as references in the application for access;\n\n(3) Organizations that provided grant funds for the project;\n\n(4) The sponsor of the publication or public presentation; and\n\n(5) Appropriate professional organizations.",

The mailing address for NWC and NWM is Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.\n\n(b) You may request a review of documents restricted under terms of a donor's deed of gift or other legal instrument to determine whether the conditions originally requiring the closure still exist. Your request must describe each document requested so that the staff can locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. For files that NARA previously screened, you may cite the reference to the withheld document as it appears on the withdrawal sheet.\n\n(c) In many instances, the director or his or her designated representative will determine whether entire documents or portions of them can be opened. However, a donor or his or her representative reserves the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed (see § 1256.36).\n\n(d) For classified information in donated historical materials, you may file a mandatory review request under Executive Order 12958, as amended, as described in § 1256.74.",

The Deputy Archivist, the Assistant Archivist for Presidential Libraries, and the Assistant Archivist for Records Services—Washington, DC, or their designated representatives, compose the Board of Review for appeals relating to donated historical materials.\n\n(b) The board's decision is final. If the board cannot make a determination on your request within 30 working days of receipt, NARA informs you of the reason for the delay. If the board determines that a document should remain closed, you may not file a new appeal for two years. Similarly, you may not file an appeal on documents in collections that have been open for research for less than 2 years.\n\n(c) In some cases, the donor or his representative may reserve the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed; you cannot appeal such decisions.\n\n(d) For information on filing appeals for requests made under mandatory review of White House originated information, see § 1260.62 of this chapter.",

          "content": "§ 1260.56   What are NARA considerations when implementing automatic declassification?\n(a) Integral File Blocks. Classified records within an integral file block that have not been reviewed and properly exempted from declassification, or referred to an equity holder, will be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block, except as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of automatic declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only records dated within 10 years of the oldest record in the block. The records of each Presidential Administration will be treated as an integral file block and will be scanned for declassification review through the RAC Project.\n\n(b) Special media records. After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center and before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly. NARA, through the NDC, will coordinate processing of referrals made in these special media records as part of its overall prioritization strategy.\n\n(c) Referrals. The IRC at the NDC will provide official notification for Federal records, while the RAC Project will provide formal notification for Presidential records. For agencies which fail to act on their referrals after formal notification by the IRC or the RAC Project, NARA will automatically declassify their information in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order.\n\n(d) Additional referrals. Agencies will identify referrals in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of the Order. NARA will delay automatic declassification for up to 1 year for classified records that have been identified by the originating agency or by NARA as having classified information that requires referral that were not identified by the primary reviewing agency.\n\n(e) Other circumstances. Information from another agency that has not been properly identified and referred is not subject to automatic declassification. When NARA identifies information, in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order, that agency will have up to 1 year from the date of formal notification to review its information for declassification.\n\n(f) Discovery of information inadvertently not reviewed. When NARA identifies a file series or collection in its physical and legal custody that contains classified information over 25 years old and that was inadvertently not reviewed before the effective date of automatic declassification, NARA must report the discovery to the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and to the responsible agency head or senior agency official within 90 days of discovery. ISOO, the responsible agency, and NARA will consult on a delay of up to three years to review the records.",

The term archivist means an employee of NARA who, by education or experience, is specially trained in archival science.\n\n(f) Agency.

NARA's official business includes educational and public programs and other activities we conduct on our own or in conjunction with government organizations, the National Archives Foundation (“Foundation”) and Presidential library foundations, or other private organizations. NARA uses all of the public areas of NARA property and facilities in the course of conducting official business.\n\n(b) We may permit, under the conditions described in this subpart, Federal agencies, quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal government organizations to occasionally use certain public areas for official activities (“government organization use”).\n\n(c) We may also permit occasional, non-official use of specified public areas for private group activities and events that relate to or further NARA's archival, records, or other interests. The authorities for such use are 44 U.S.C. 2112(e) (for Presidential libraries) and 44 U.S.C. 2903(b) (for other NARA property and facilities).\n\n(1) Examples of private use that relate to or further NARA's archival, records, or other interests include, but are not limited to: Meetings and other business activities held by archival, historical, or other professional organizations with a connection to NARA's holdings or mission; activities or events that promote research in, or use or preservation of, NARA holdings; invitation-only screening of film or TV premieres when NARA holdings have been used in the production or when the screening otherwise promotes use of NARA holdings (e.g., documentary film premiere); and dinners, receptions, or other private group events where the connection to NARA is the location itself (e.g., The National Archives Building or a Presidential library) or the opportunity to view NARA exhibits. Private group events may include events of a personal or social nature, such as weddings and wedding receptions, and school-sponsored activities.\n\n(2) Each NARA facility with public use space determines whether and what kind of events of a personal nature the facility can support, given the size and configuration of available space, staff availability, and other logistical factors. We also reserve the right to limit the number and size of personal celebrations, and to limit or prohibit activities as part of a private group event that pose a risk to the facility, property, people, or our holdings. If you are interested in holding a private group event at a NARA facility, contact that facility directly for more information. See 36 CFR part 1253 for facility listings and contact information.\n\n(3) We may charge fees for private group and government organization use of these public areas and the services related to such use.

These rules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which are processed under subpart B of this part, are processed under this subpart also. Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Foundation activity (for example, press releases, annual reports, informational brochures and the like) may be provided to the public without following this subpart. As a matter of policy, the Foundation makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court. \n\n(b) This subpart applies to all Foundation programs, including the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR).",

Udall Foundation, 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, Arizona 85701-1650. If you are making a request for records about yourself, see § 1600.21 for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records about another individual, either a written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) will help the processing of your request. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Freedom of Information Act Request.” \n\n(b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable Foundation personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If the Foundation determines that your request does not reasonably describe records, it will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. If your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, the response to your request may be delayed. \n\n(c) Types of records not available. The FOIA does not require the Foundation to: \n\n(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records; \n\n(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or \n\n(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the Foundation must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed of. \n\n(d) Agreement to pay fees. If you make a FOIA request, your request shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 1600.10, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. The Foundation ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.",

The Foundation ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt. \n\n(b) Multitrack processing. (1) The Foundation may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. The anticipated number of pages involved may be considered by the Foundation in establishing processing tracks. If the Foundation sets a page limit for its faster track, it will advise those whose request is placed in its slower track(s) of the page limits of its faster track(s). \n\n(2) If the Foundation uses multitrack processing, it may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of its faster track(s). \n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. (1) Where the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Foundation decides to extend the time limits on that basis, the Foundation shall as soon as practicable notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension is for more than 10 working days, the Foundation shall provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative time period for processing the request or a modified request. \n\n(2) Where the Foundation reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated. \n\n(d) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve: \n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or \n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; \n\n(2) You may ask for expedited processing of a request for records at any time. \n\n(3) In order to request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, if you are a requester within the category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, and you are not a full-time member of the news media, you must establish that you are a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be your sole occupation; you also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion. \n\n(4) Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Foundation will decide whether to grant it and will notify you of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.",

On receipt of your request, the Foundation ordinarily will send an acknowledgment letter to you, which will confirm your agreement to pay fees under § 1600.3(d) and provide an assigned request number for further reference. \n\n(b) Referral to another agency. When a requester seeks records that originated in another Federal government agency, the Foundation will refer the request to the other agency for response. If the Foundation refers the request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral. A request for any records classified by some other agency will be referred to that agency for response. \n\n(c) Grants of requests. Ordinarily, the Foundation will have 20 business days from when your request is received to determine whether to grant or deny your request. Once the Foundation determines to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify you in writing. The Foundation will inform you in the notice of any fee charged under § 1600.10 and will disclose records to you promptly on payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also will be indicated on the record, if technically feasible. \n\n(d) Adverse determinations of requests. If the Foundation denies your request in any respect, it will notify you of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The denial letter shall be signed by the General Counsel or his/her designee, and shall include: \n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial; \n\n(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request; \n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and \n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1600.8(a) and a description of the requirements for appeal.",

An example that applies to the Foundation is the confidentiality protection for dispute resolution communications provided by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA, 5 U.S.C. 571-574). \n\n(4) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; \n\n(5) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Foundation; \n\n(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; \n\n(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information: \n\n(i) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; \n\n(ii) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication; \n\n(iii) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; \n\n(iv) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and in the case of a recorded or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source; \n\n(v) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or \n\n(vi) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. \n\n(8) Records contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; \n\n(9) Geological or geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells. \n\n(b) If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempted material, all reasonable segregable nonexempt material shall be disclosed. \n\n(c) Even if an exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section may be reasonably applicable to a requested record, or portion thereof, the Foundation may elect under the circumstances of any particular request not to apply the exemption to such requested record, or portion thereof, subject to the provisions in § 1600.7 for confidential commercial information. The fact that the exemption is not applied by the Foundation to any requested record, or portion thereof, has no precedential significance as to the application or non-application of the exemption to any other requested record, or portion thereof, no matter when the request is received.",

          "content": "§ 1600.7   Special procedures for confidential commercial information.\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section: \n\n(1) Business submitter means any person or entity which provides confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly, to the Foundation and who has a proprietary interest in the information. \n\n(2) Commercial-use requester means requesters seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Foundation shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where the Foundation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Foundation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. \n\n(3) Confidential commercial information means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm. \n\n(b) In general. Confidential commercial information provided to the Foundation by a business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to an FOIA request except in accordance with this section. \n\n(c) Designation of business information. Business submitters should use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to be protected under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted to the government, unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period of longer duration. \n\n(d) Predisclosure notification. (1) Except as is provided for in paragraph (i) of this section, the Foundation shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter with prompt written notice of an FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing its confidential business information whenever required under paragraph (e) of this section. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information. \n\n(2) Whenever the Foundation provides a business submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Foundation shall notify the requester that the request includes information that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA and that the person or entity who submitted the information to the Foundation has been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure of information. \n\n(e) When notice is required. The Foundation shall provide a business submitter with notice of a request whenever— \n\n(1) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as business information deemed protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); or\n\n(2) The Foundation has reason to believe that the request seeks business information the disclosure of which may result in substantial commercial or financial injury to the business submitter. \n\n(f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Foundation shall, to the extent permitted by law, afford a business submitter at least 10 working days within which it can provide the Foundation with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and why disclosure would cause competitive harm. Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA. \n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. (1) The Foundation shall consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose confidential commercial business information. Whenever the Foundation decides to disclose such information over the objection of a business submitter, the Foundation shall forward to the business submitter a written notice at least 10 working days before the date of disclosure containing— \n\n(i) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained,\n\n(ii) A description of the confidential commercial information to be disclosed, and\n\n(iii) A specified disclosure date. \n\n(2) Such notice of intent to disclose likewise shall be forwarded to the requester at least 10 working days prior to the specified disclosure date. \n\n(h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Foundation shall promptly notify the business submitter of such action. \n\n(i) Exceptions to predisclosure notification. The requirements of this section shall not apply if— \n\n(1) The Foundation determines that the information should not be disclosed; \n\n(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; \n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such a case, the Foundation will provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose confidential commercial information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.",

          "section_name": "§ 1600.10   Fees.",
          "content": "§ 1600.10   Fees.\n(a) In general. The Foundation will charge you for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (i) of this section. The Foundation ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to you. You must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the United States Treasury. \n\n(b) Definitions. For purposes of this section: \n\n(1) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of a person seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. If the Foundation determines that you will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of your request itself or because the Foundation has reasonable cause to doubt your stated use, the Foundation will provide you a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification. \n\n(2) Direct costs means those expenses that the Foundation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of operating duplication machinery. \n\n(3) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, available in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. The Foundation will honor your specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format. \n\n(4) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. \n\n(5) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research. \n\n(6) Representative of the news media, or news media requester, means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. For freelance journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Foundation shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. \n\n(7) Review means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure—for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. \n\n(8) Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. \n\n(c) Fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the Foundation will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (i) of this section: \n\n(1) Search. Search fees will be charged for all requests, except for those by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media (subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section). Charges may be made for time spent searching even if no responsive record is located or if the record(s) are withheld as entirely exempt from disclosure. \n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged for all requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record, the fee will be ten cents per page. For other forms of duplication (including copies produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts), the Foundation will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. \n\n(3) Review. Review fees will be charged only for commercial use requests. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review—in other words, the review done when the Foundation determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records or record portions withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies; the costs of that review are chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances. \n\n(4) Searches and reviews—amounts of fees. (i) For each quarter hour spent in searching for and/or reviewing a requested record, the fees will be: $4.00 for clerical personnel; $7.00 for professional personnel; and $10.25 for managerial personnel. \n\n(ii) For computer searches of records, you will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for responsive records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. \n\n(d) Limitations on charging fees. (1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. \n\n(2) Review fees will be charged only for commercial use requests. \n\n(3) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review. \n\n(4) Except for commercial use requests, the Foundation will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time to requesters without charge. These provisions work together, so that the Foundation will not begin to assess fees until after providing the free search and reproduction. For example, if a request involves three hours of search time and duplication of 105 pages of documents, the Foundation will charge only for the cost of one hour of search time and five pages of reproduction. \n\n(5) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (d) of this section is $14.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged. \n\n(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. When the Foundation determines or estimates that the fees will be more than $25.00, it will notify you of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless you have indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Foundation will advise you that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which you have been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until you agree in writing to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice under this paragraph will offer you an opportunity to discuss the matter with Foundation personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet your needs at a lower cost. \n\n(f) Charging interest. The Foundation may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the Foundation. \n\n(g) Aggregating requests. Where the Foundation reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, it may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Foundation may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, they will be aggregated only if there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated. \n\n(h) Advance payments. (1) No advance payment (that is, payment before work is begun on a request) will ordinarily be required, except as described in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section. Payment owed for work already completed (that is, a prepayment before copies are sent to you) is not considered an advance payment. \n\n(2) Where the Foundation determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require you to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives satisfactory assurance of full payment from you and you have a history of prompt payment. \n\n(3) If you have previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Foundation may require you to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before it begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from you. \n\n(4) In cases in which the Foundation requires advance payment or payment due under paragraph (h)(2) or (3) of this section, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the required payment is received. \n\n(i) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where the Foundation determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that: \n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and \n\n(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. \n\n(2) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records. \n\n(3) If you request a waiver or reduction of fees, your request should address the factors listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.",

Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation (the “Foundation”) follows under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained by the Foundation that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Foundation. In addition, the Foundation processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, following the rules contained in subpart A of this part, which gives requests the benefit of both statutes. \n\n(b) Applicability. This subpart applies to all Foundation programs, including the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR). \n\n(c) Definitions. As used in this subpart: \n\n(1) Request for access to a record means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(1). \n\n(2) Request for amendment or correction of a record means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(2). \n\n(3) Request for an accounting means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (c)(3). \n\n(4) Requester means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act.",

You may make a request for access to a Foundation record about yourself by appearing in person or by writing to the Foundation. Your request should be sent or delivered to the Foundation's General Counsel, at 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, AZ 85701-1650. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request.” \n\n(b) Description of records sought. You must describe the records that you want in enough detail to enable Foundation personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe they are kept. The Foundation publishes notices in the Federal Register that describe its systems of records. A description of the Foundation's systems of records also may be found as part of the “Privacy Act Compilation” published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. This compilation is available in most large reference and university libraries. This compilation also can be accessed electronically at the Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site (which can be found at http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs). \n\n(c) Agreement to pay fees. If you make a Privacy Act request for access to records, it shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 1600.29 up to $25.00. The Foundation ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. \n\n(d) Verification of identity. When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social security number. \n\n(e) Verification of guardianship. When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, you must establish: \n\n(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at your option, the social security number of the individual; \n\n(2) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section; \n\n(3) That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your guardianship; and (4) That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.",

In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Foundation ordinarily will include only those records in its possession as of the date the Foundation begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the Foundation will inform the requester of that date. \n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The Foundation's General Counsel, or his/her designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access to a record of the Foundation. \n\n(c) Consultations and referrals. When the Foundation receives a request for access to a record in its possession, it will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy Act. If the Foundation determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so. If the Foundation determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either: \n\n(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether it is exempt from access. \n\n(d) Notice of referral.

Once the Foundation makes a determination to grant your request for access in whole or in part, it will notify you in writing. The Foundation will inform you in the notice of any fee charged under § 1600.29 and will disclose records to you promptly on payment of any applicable fee.
